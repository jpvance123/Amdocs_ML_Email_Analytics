Below are filings that EPMI and EES will make next week.  Once granted by 
FERC, they will allow EPMI and EES to perform some regulatory filings and 
functions on behalf of the industrials.  An industrial selling into the grid 
will still be considered a "licensed power marketer", but we can handle many 
of the tasks, thus making it easier for them to sell to Enron, rather than 
another power marketer that has not filed this application at FERC.

I talked to Kevin about this last night, and we discussed the fact that this 
FERC authorization WILL NOT allow the industrial to circumvent its host 
utility tariff.  Therefore, if the industrial is restricted from selling 
power from its on-site generator to the grid by the host tariff, FERC will 
not override that.  (FERC made that clear in the initial 'InPower" filing in 
response to a request from JEA.)  For example, several years ago at Jim 
Fallon's request, we checked the HLP tariff and found that it restricted EPMI 
from selling power to the grid from the generators in the Enron building 
basement.

While Kevin thinks that this can be a valuable filing, he is concerned that 
many utility sales tariffs restrict power sales to the grid from on-site 
generators.  In addition, Mark Dobler and John Berger are working at EES on 
distributed generation solutions and could be restricted from the optionality 
that grid sales provide vs. use of distributed generation on site.  

It seems that we may want to focus some state resources on making sure that 
the utility tariffs, especially in open access retail states, provide for 
maximum flexibility for industrial customers.  

Let me know if you would like me to visit with Mark Dobler about this or 
provide other assistance.  Thanks.  Christi

I just came across this morning to some additional information from the 
regulator (CNE) regarding their motivations on its Arcos TPA ruling: 

1) Despite the current regulatory gaps, Enron's allegations were properly 
crafted, and made possible a way forward within the existing legal framework. 
The "two-sides commitment" idea suggested by Enron has been quite determinant 
because...

2) ... the resolution fundamentally aims at making sure that the power plant 
is actually built (Enron finally commits), but also that new gas 
infrastructures start being developed asap!! There is clearly an underlying 
energy policy issue here, and this reasoning fits with the tight timescales 
imposed by the CNE to ratify our interest and signing the TPA contract. The 
resolution is seen by the CNE as a catalyser to put in track gas expansions 
and power plant investments.

Note that the CNE (and the Ministry) are testing if Enron is "truly" 
committed to put the money and invest by placing us in a no-return point 
(mine).

Please, find below a full English translation of the CNE's ruling.


Of special interest, see sections III, VI, VII and IX of the GROUNDS FOR THE 
DECISION ADOPTED Chapter.

Executive Summary
? California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
? California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to "Plan B"

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set 
up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or 
October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.  
However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and 
November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the 
DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.  
He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge "Plan B"
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge "Plan B" 
before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a 
retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review 
power purchases.  This is because "Plan B" enables SoCal to collect a 
dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going 
forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate 
component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This 
takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off 
the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same 
time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power 
purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of 
a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the 
PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to 
the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the 
PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for 
power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as 
"arguable"; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, 
regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to 
cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of 
the Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe 
it might "go a long way toward avoiding these problems."  Were this to 
happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates "just and reasonable," which would 
likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such 
measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that "the 
state needs to tease the feds into doing this."  This can be done by 
conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would 
use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of 
"teasing" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California 
politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to 
impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is 
delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these 
constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as 
municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there 
remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the 
Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain 
momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.  
Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were 
both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.  
(His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica, 
overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.  
His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate 
Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to 
support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will 
likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

Regulators in Washington State Approve
Accord to Trim Companies' Power Costs
By ROBERT GAVIN
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington state regulators Thursday approved a settlement
between the state's biggest utility and some of the largest industrial users
that aims to lower the companies' soaring electricity costs.

The settlement brings to an end a bitter dispute between some large
industrial concerns, including Seattle-based Boeing Co. and Puget Sound
Energy of Bellevue over a pricing structure that tied electricity sales to
volatile spot markets, where prices have soared to levels 10 or more times
as high as year-ago prices. Recent spot-market prices have ranged between
$200 and $350 a megawatt hour.

The settlement, in effect, introduces retail electricity competition in a
state that has yet to deregulate its power markets.

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, which announced the
settlement, had ordered hearings in January to develop price controls after
a dozen companies filed complaints alleging they were being overcharged by
Puget Sound Energy. The hearings were delayed while the parties negotiated
the settlement.

Under the settlement, the six biggest customers will be able to buy power
from any source, including other utilities, power marketers and even each
other. Puget Sound Energy will provide the transmission at regulated rates,
which include the cost of transmission and a profit. This arrangement will
allow the customers to lower costs because they will be able to enter
longer-term contracts, typically 60 to 90 days, at prices that are lower
than those of the spot market, which reflects the most expensive prices.

In addition to Boeing, those customers include Georgia-Pacific Corp. of
Atlanta, which operates a plant in Bellingham, and Equilon Enterprises LLC
of Houston, which operates refineries near Anacortes.

"This gives us the flexibility to structure our own transactions and
purchase power at prices [at which] they can afford to stay in business,"
says Melinda Davison, a lawyer who represented most of the companies in the
case.

Puget Sound Energy officials weren't available for comment.

Part of the settlement is similar to Oregon's electricity-deregulation plan
for big commercial customers, scheduled to take effect in the fall. Cass
Bielski, a regulatory analyst at Edison Electric Institute, a Washington,
D.C., industry group, called the settlement "cutting-edge news in the
industry" and "unusual in a state that has not adopted electric retail
choice" as a policy.

Under the settlement, four smaller users -- including Intel Corp. of Santa
Clara, Calif., which operates a plant near Tacoma -- were given the option
of seeking alternative electricity providers or buying power from Puget
Sound Energy at rates capped at either $225 per megawatt hour or $100 less
than the spot price on a major Northwestern U.S. spot-price market. Two even
smaller users will simply buy their power at regulated rates.

Puget Sound Energy also agreed not to recover any revenue lost because of
the settlement from other residential and commercial ratepayers.

Here is a working draft of the gas issues/diversion/penalties, etc. paper.  
Becky is working on the interstate pipeline tariffs and we will insert them, 
and Jeff Hidge will be sending something out about ENA legal issues, which I 
will add in.  I am also going to work on this tonite, to make the individual 
LDC diucssions follow a common template.  However, I wanted you to have 
something to look at before the meeting tomorrow morning.  I still have a 
couple of LDCs to add.  Thanks.

The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite 

By DAVE BARRY  

When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  
reaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley 
MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  
Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that "electricity" is defined  as a 
"class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges." What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  

Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  
Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, 
Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called "generators,"  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of "volts"  (also 
known as "watts," or "rpm" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a "circuit."  

But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  
electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout "CLEAR!" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be 
wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number 
of  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: 
Please  insert my point).  

The question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow 
countrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare 
electricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this 
great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them 
together, forming a  giant electrical "chain of helping" across the fruited 
plain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous 
smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. 
This involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

Here's an attempt at some key "lessons" from CA to the UK (or vice versa as 
the case may be).  Actually they are more themes/differences/comments coming 
out of the CA experience, which will need tailoring/trimming down to fit the 
context of the actual presentation.  As I've indicated, depending on the 
point being presented, there may be a need for some caution in using the 
examples in too simplistic a context.

? Barriers to generator entry.
? Apart from the moratorium, it has been relatively easy to gain consent to 
construct new generation in the UK.  This is clearly a good thing in itself, 
but there are some potential pitfalls in just asserting this.  The entry has 
been criticised as unecessary in a market with significant overcapacity 
(indeed this was one of the justifications for the moratorium) and had 
surprisingly little impact on price for at least the first 8 years of the 
Pool. Indeed prices only fell once NP/PG divested plant.  Hence it would be 
easy to retort that new capacity was not required in the UK, the entry that 
did occur was wasteful and that the CA analogy is bogus (although clearly the 
full story is more complex than this)
? Moratorium had a significant impact on investment and stalled competition.  
(True, but difficult to sustain given that divestment and pre-committed new 
entry ensured that prices fell significantly before the moratorium was 
lifted.)
? Danger that measures designed to meet the CHP and Renewables targets 
constrain future developments and lead to capacity shortages, ie, perfection 
should not be the enemy of the good.  This is not the case currently.  
However, new applications must demonstrate that CHP has been fully explored - 
if this hurdle acquires real teeth (or turns into something more formal) then 
we could see easy consents getting significantly more difficult.  This is, 
however, largely speculation at the current time.

? Retail caps
? Purchase costs could be passed through in UK (for at least the first 8 
years).  Although some purchase costs were pseudo-regulated (through the 
vesting contracts and their replacements),  the Public Electricity Suppliers 
also purchased power from CCGTs in which they also took equity at very high 
prices.  (Teesside was one of the first examples of this.) The cost of this 
was passed through to franchise customers.  This was widely criticised and 
although the regulator allowed this to happen (on the grounds of entry 
promoting competition), the fact that all the entry was baseload and NP/PG 
still controlled the marginal plant meant that wholesale market prices didn't 
change at all.
? Since 1998, prices caps have been instituted and have not been a problem.  
Although the caps squeezed the PES margins, they could contract forward to 
hedge the risk of wholesale price movements.  Morever, the price caps have 
actually reduce wholelsale prices - generator market power meant that the 
wholesale price was, in part, a net-back from the allowed retail tariff.
? Watch out for Independent Energy, a supplier who did go bankrupt.  This was 
due to a combination of being under-hedged when power prices rose and not 
having adequate infrastructure to bill customers and get the cash in.

? Competition
? Generator concentration meant excessive prices for the first 8-9 years of 
the Pool.  Restructuring and divestment was essential to realising the 
benefits of competition.
? Retail competition has been very successful and has been a key driver in 
increasing liquidity in the wholesale market


? Stranded Costs
? Stranded cost recovery largely didn't distort the market, eg, nuclear levy, 
vesting contracts did not affect marginal decisions.  (That said market power 
provided a very soft landing and the market was clearly stitched up to meet 
the needs of the miners for years.)

Hope these help.  Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

Paul

The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The 
word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and 
that Reliant had an "understanding" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not 
supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price 
represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very 
limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times 
this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant 
having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have 
had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when 
there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever 
higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders. 

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market. 

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.'' 

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being 
``obstructionist'': 

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program. 

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.'' 

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

Jeff:

Per your request, please find the 2 Memo's we prepared on
interconnection agreements - the first deals with general rights and
responsibilities, including options for obtaining ICAs.  The second Memo
focuses entirely on the specifics of how ETI obtains ICAs, and the
advantages and disadvantages fo each option.

Once you have had a chance to review the Memo's, we can discuss the next
steps in more detail.  Please feel free to let us know any questions in
the meantime. Thanks.

Dear All

Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of 
the peer group mapping by function. It was decided that each member would 
review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year. 

The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business 
Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve 
Kean.

Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two 
pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the 
proposed peer group 
structure.

I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been 
instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any 
specific information you require concerning placements with your business 
area.

I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in 
function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will 
be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues.

Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next 
meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a 
morning meeting.


David Oxley

Julie

Per Mark Bennett, I am forwarding to you a write up I have put together 
outlining the need for EPSA representation and more importantly, member 
participation at NERC.

Please distribute this to the participants at the April 18 EPSA - NERC 
Summit.  I will be attending the meeting and will gladly expand on the 
impacts of NERC policies on the market.

FYI:  I thought SEC's views on the MidAmerican PUHCA language would interest 
you.  At this point, this appears dead....but we are still working it to keep 
it that way.

PUCHA
     legislation that you requested.  Please let me know if you need
anything
     else or would like to discuss further.

SCE held a conference call this morning to discuss the  Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) related to the sale of its transmission assets with 
members of the investment community.  After a  brief description of major 
provisions of the MOU, questions were taken.  Following is a summary of that 
call.

Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the "Governor's Plan")

Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 
years
Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR
Dedication of the "Sunrise" generation project to cost-of-service based rates 
for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August)
Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at 
two hydro projects)
Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01
Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years
Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE
SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, 
assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary

It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an 
integrated package.  While the CPUC and members of the legislature were 
involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically 
between SCE and CDWR.  Various regulatory and legislative approvals are 
necessary for implementation of the MOU.  SCE has rights to terminate the MOU 
if the CPUC  has not adopted specified "implementing decisions" within 60 
days.  Legislation necessary to implement certain provisions of the MOU must 
be passed by August 15.

For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation 
and distribution rate base.

Questions and Answers

What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE?
Up to the rating agencies.  Many steps to go through.  It is assumed agencies 
will be following closely but timing is uncertain.  Would have to be before 
utility resumes power procurement obligations.

Applicability of 11.6% ROE?
ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both 
generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and 
capital structure roughly at 50/50.

Potential for write-offs?
While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, 
because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a "write-up" at a 
later date.

Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project 
(investor concern over market v. regulated returns)?
The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts.  Market 
returns traded for security of long-term contract.

What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years?
Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional 
investments from holding company.

Concern over ability of existing rate level (and "waterfall" disbursement) to 
recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase?
 Existing rates should cover all costs.  Provisions in MOU allow adjustment 
to rates to maintain investment grade status.

What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts?
Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. 

Will the sale be a taxable event?
Yes.

What is the URG unit cost?
$.042 per kwH.

In 2003 would SCE have ability to replace contracts of CDWR (when SCE resumes 
procurement role)?
SCE would have ability to enter into new contracts, but would not ignore 
obligations under CDWR contracts.  New contracts would be subject to PUC 
prudence review.  SCE would file procurement plan with the PUC.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : July 3, 2001
Report: CA Energy Crisis Overshadows Success Of PJM 
While some may argue that California's energy woes offer a prime reason for 
placing the electric competition genie firmly back in its bottle, a recent 
case study by a global consulting group asserts that California's energy 
difficulties mask the fact that other power markets in the United States are 
not only surviving, but thriving, with the PJM market serving as the perfect 
example. 
The report by PA Consulting, "PJM - Electric Power Competition That Works," 
notes that in the wake of California's energy crisis, the future of electric 
power restructuring and deregulation in the United States is increasingly 
being called into question. The growing national debate over the fate of 
electric power restructuring is couched more and more in stark terms of "to 
be, or not to be." But PA Consulting argues that this "simplistic debate" 
presents the nation with the choice of either pushing ahead with 
restructuring and potentially facing California-like difficulties in other 
parts of the country or reverting back to a more intrusive, 
command-and-control regulatory system. 
In PA Consulting's view, limiting the national debate to these two extremes 
ignores the fact that California is not the typical model for competitive 
wholesale electricity markets. "Indeed, there are several competitive 
wholesale markets at work in the United States that differ significantly from 
California's in both structure and results." One of the most "dynamic, robust 
and successful" of these other regional wholesale electricity markets is the 
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market in the mid-Atlantic region, the 
study asserts. "Understanding why the PJM model has succeeded in many areas 
where the California model has failed may provide regulators, legislators and 
other interested groups with a powerful reference point in the growing debate 
concerning whether continued market reform in the electric power industry is 
in our future." 
The report notes that PJM offers an interesting example for a competitive 
market case study because it is similar in size to the California market and 
has a longer track record of spot market operations. While there are 
similarities in market size and spot market longevity, significant 
differences exist between PJM and California in terms of regulatory 
jurisdiction and market composition, according to PA Consulting. 
More specifically, the study points out that in terms of regulatory 
authority, the PJM market -- unlike California's -- overlaps the jurisdiction 
of five states and the District of Columbia. In some ways, the multiple 
regulatory jurisdictions within PJM have allowed the market and market 
operator to remain largely independent of any one regulatory authority. In 
contrast, single-state markets such as California and New York have state 
regulators and legislatures that wield considerable influence and a stronger 
sense of ownership of the market and its actions, the study adds. Some have 
argued that this control has been exerted to the detriment of market function 
and independence, while FERC has been troubled by single-state control, the 
study went on to say. 
By way of comparison, the PJM experience illustrates that, in a market 
operating across multiple jurisdictions, no single state can dictate 
conditions. In such an environment, the wholesale market will be regulated 
primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, reducing the influence 
of state politics and allowing the market to adopt a broader regional 
perspective, the study notes. 
"This case study provides a powerful counterpoint to those who would like to 
turn back the clock on electric power competition," said Phillip Harris, CEO 
of PJM. "Our market model provides a blueprint for a working competitive 
marketplace that has been refined during four years of successful operation."

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan.  See Section 
5 - A Japanese Pool.  They make several good arguments as to why a mandatory 
pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for Japanese 
liberalization.   Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US policy arguments.

The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolved 
issues of material fact".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

The IPPNY/SSK communications effort for NY is finally a go!  Since I will be 
on a train from Philly to NYC tomorrow during the Leadership call the 
following is a quick summary of what's going on in NY.

IPPNY/EPSA
Gavin Donohue, Mark Stultz and myself met Tuesday for lunch and discussed 
each organizations' communications efforts and the need for coordination 
given the overlap in membership, the dual focus on NYC, and the costs 
involved.  

The EPSA effort is a "reassurance" campaign for states who have already begun 
deregulation but who might be nervous to proceed after witnessing the CA 
debacle.
EPSA is working with the Chamber of Commerce and is focused on four markets 
(Boston, NYC, Baltimore and DC).
EPSA contracted with a PR firm out of Austin, TX and they have already 
developed 3 broadcast advertising spots (Mark is on the steering committee 
and should have access to the spots) 
EPSA shared the spots with SSK and IPPNY yesterday (which SSK didn't like 
very much)
The ads would run on PBS and cable - the media buys have not been purchased 
yet.
Apparently EPSA developed the ads and are running them past focus groups as 
we speak
Interestingly enough, the spot which they developed for the eastern states 
used the word deregulation over and over (a word that is not popular here).  
AND when tested among the opinion elites - they didn't know who PJM was!! 
Lastly, the accompanying print ad isn't that impressive.
Mark will have access  to the ads and - as a steering committee member - will 
have the opportunity to weigh in on the ad and decide whether to move to the 
second phase of funding.
The good news is that EPSA has agreed to not interfere with what IPPNY is 
doing in NY and will work with us as our efforts evolve.

IPPNY/SSK
During our meeting on Tuesday, we finalized the initial press release, and 
agreed on the inserts for the press kit.  Apparently, Hillary Clinton and 
other members of the NY delegation are holding an energy roundtable on 
Monday.  IPPNY's press release will go out over the wires Monday around 11:00 
am and will hopefully get dual coverage from reporters who are covering 
Hillary's event.  I'll forward to you the final release but it generally says 
that IPPNY is unveiling its Energy Solutions Program - a five point action 
plan to address the long and short term energy needs of NY (designed to avoid 
a CA-style energy crisis).  The plan includes energy conservation (which was 
on the top of new yorkers minds in the statewide poll), accelerated siting 
process, creation of an efficient, multi-state energy marketplace, upgrading 
the state's power transmission system and encouraging utilities to enter into 
contracts that protect consumers from volatile energy prices.

Gavin will be back in NYC on July 10th for media training and SSK is in the 
process of lining him up for meetings with press outlets and other 
organizations.  

We're also planning to schedule him at various events around the state which 
deal with energy issues.

We hope to host some sort of energy roundtable of our own at the IPPNY fall 
meeting in October.

As for advertising, we don't have the funds or the commitment today but after 
we launch this effort we're going to pull the participating companies 
together to have a discussion about advertising and to guage whether they 
want to support it with additional funds. 

I'll get you final copies of the release and press kit as soon as they are 
put together. 

To date, Enron is in for 50K in NY but it's been an expensive three months of 
research, and prep time and materials so managing the budget is going to be 
an issue throughout the summer.  

I will be in PJM all day Thursday to cover PJM's initial meeting for the 
development of their communications office and get a rundown of their plans 
for "messaging"

It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing.

Enron gets a win in Florida.  Let me know if you want a copy of the revised 
opinion.

MR,

Yesterday, the Florida Supreme Court granted our Motion for Leave to Appear 
as Amicus Curiae on Rehearing that we filed on Enron's behalf in theTampa 
Electric Co. v. Garcia  case.  It also granted the relief we requested in 
that Motion.  The Court granted this relief despite the vehement protests by 
Florida Power and Light and Florida Power Corporation that (1) Enron had no 
standing or right to appear as an amicus curiae and (2) that the relief we 
requested was unwarranted.

Technically, the Court characterized its order granting relief to Enron as 
"granting the Motion for Leave to Appear as Amicus Curiae on Rehearing, and 
denying the Incorporated Motion for Rehearing in light of the revised 
opinion.."  In short, there was no need to grant rehearing because, in its 
revised opinion, the Court granted our relief.  This was exactly what 
Katherine Giddings (one of our appellate experts and co-counsel for Enron in 
this matter) had predicted the Court would do if it granted our requested 
relief. 

A comparison of our requested language and the language included by the Court 
in its opinion are identical.  In its previous opinion, the Court made the 
following statement:  "The construction of any new electrical power 
generating plant with a capacity greater than seventy-five megawatts is 
required to be certified in accord with the various requirements of the 
Siting Act in chapter 403, Florida Statutes."  The Court's definition 
appeared to broaden the class of electrical power generating facilities that 
must be certified under the Siting Act because it failed to recognize 
statutorily exempt utilities, i.e., under the statutes, only certain steam 
and solar electrical generating facilities are subject to the Act - but the 
Court's definition included "any" electrical power generating facility.  

In our motion, we pointed out the Court's error and asked the Court to 
clarify its definition by changing its statement to read:  "The construction 
of any new electrical power generating plant as defined by Section 
403.503(12) that is not otherwise exempted by Florida law is required to be 
certified in accord with the various requirements of the Siting Act in 
chapter 403, Florida Statutes."   The Court adopted this language verbatim, 
adding only the words "Florida Statutes" after the reference to Section 
403.503(12).  In doing so, the Court recognized the merit of our argument.  
In summary, the Court granted all relief we requested on Enron's behalf.  The 
relief requested by other parties in all other motions for rehearing, 
including the PSC's, was denied in total.  

Bill

Subject: Enron Global Government Affairs Promotions

I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals 
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale 
electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, 
resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool 
Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in 
the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional 
opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron 
Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the 
United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also 
played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in 
helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the 
delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned 
utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's 
competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced 
considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob 
has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial 
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition 
last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value 
embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of 
both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity 
industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously 
during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that 
retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in 
California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging 
state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights 
tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in 
California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their 
significant accomplishments.

It is decision time.  The City has verbally agreed to ALL of our "5" major 
issues.  Their General Counsel and Ed Essandoh are trading drafts of proposed 
language today and tomorrow.  The deal is not without risk in the next 30 
days.  However, the City has responded to all of our demands, has gotten the 
proper people involved, and seems very interested in completing this 
transaction.  Overall, from what I have seen in the last 3 weeks, it appears 
we have a good deal here.  Following you will find:

Notional Deal Valuation
 
 -  You will only find the deals we anticipate would close at the July 
Council mtg, good chance others may come but they are not considered here.

Positive Forces for Enron

Risks for Enron (w/Plan to Mitigate)

Estimated Costs to Finish the Deal (conservative estimate)

Action Plan/Timeline


Notional Deal Valuation 

Department   Estimates Ann Spend  TCV  MTM

Airports *    $15   $120  $2.0

Water Dept    $10   $80  $1.2

DGS     $10   $80  $1.2

CTA - Non-Traction   $15   $120  $2.0

Total     $50   $400  $6.4

Note: We are currently working on the Airports.  The City has commit the 
other facilities if we can do it by the June City Council meeting.  We think 
the above deals are similar in nature and can be ready by June introduction.


Positive Forces for Enron

The Mayor has endorsed this to his people and is willing to do so publicly.

Powerful political forces are removing obstacles to this deal.

City Officials are ready to back this deal in front of City Council.

Concessions from the City to this point have been unprecedented (according to 
outside counsel, consultants, and City employees/officials).

Risks for Enron

MBE/MWE perception of total contract value versus obligations to MBE/MWE 
requirements.  The Compliance Department has agreed to evaluate the rule of 
law against our administrative costs since this is a commodity deal.  
Perception needs to be managed.  Plan to mitigate:  Hire MWE/MBE consultant 
to work with appropriate Enron people to develop a plan.  THIS needs to be 
resolved before any public announcement.

Public perception needs to managed.  Plan to mitigate:  It is our intent to 
work with Peggy's group to hire a local PR consultant.  The Enron people will 
manage how we interact with this group.

There is a chance that City Council could possibly not approve our contract 
and ordinance once the Mayor submits it.  Plan to mitigate:  We are designing 
a plan to deploy political consultants and lobbyists to influence the process.

Enron will need a "face" in Chicago to work with City Council, deal issues, 
and potentially the media.  Plan to mitigate:  Eric does his current job from 
Chicago in June and part of July.

Estimated Costs to Finish the Deal (conservative estimate)

Outside Counsel (Contract, City Council work)    $30,000

PR Consultant        $20,000

MBE/MWE Consultant       $20,000

Travel and Housing (Eric)      $15,000

Internal Structuring & Legal        $5,000

Total         $90,000

Action Plan/Timeline

Final written language for major issues     5/9

Ed Essandoh to finalize all language (in Chicago)   5/10

Meetings to set plan to mitigate Risks for Enron    5/11 

Meeting with City to discuss action plan and roll-out to Council  5/14

Action Plan Further Defined      5/15


It is imperative that we make a decision on this deal now.  We look bad 
enough killing it after all the city's concessions.  However, we will look 
worse in the public eye if we back out later.

Last week, Governor Patton issued an order imposing a moratorium on accepting 
new power plant applications for 6 months.  He also ordered the PSC and Env. 
Protection Cabinet to study the effects of new plants on the environment and 
the issues related to the impact on the grid, siting issues and econ. dev.  
He also directed the agencies to give particular attention to preserving and 
enhancing the use of KY coal.  Enron recently filed an application at the 
Env. Protection Cabinet for an air permit on the Calvert City site.  Ben 
Jacoby informed me that we are going to have to change the application.  
Based on his consultant's read of the order, we will be able to do so w/o 
being subject to the moratorium.  Gov. Patton has also set up an energy 
policy committee.  Bill Butler, with the local chamber of commerce for 
Calvert City has apparently been appointed to the committee.  Ben has worked 
closely with Bill over the years to get Calvert up and running.   I am 
monitoring this committee for Ben.  

Also, in TN, the Governor is going to form an inter-agency work group on 
energy policy.  I have received what appears to be an internal document on 
this.  Robert Gowan at Stoke Bartholomew thinks this is being motivated by 
TVA and their concerns on air emissions limitations.  Apparently there are 
going to be 2 phases to the work group -- the first is going to be to improve 
state government's use of energy.  The state just this week has 
enthusiastically agreed to EEIS' proposal for the FASER upgrade.  They have 
asked EEIS to provide input on phase 1.  I have spoken with Pam Rosen who has 
agreed to keep me in the loop on anything having to do with the working 
group.  Phase 2 is going to focus on an overall state energy policy.  As you 
know, ENA has a sight under development outside of Memphis and EES is on the 
short list in Nashville for a facility deal.   I have notified Ben Jacoby and 
Jeff Ader on these developments.  I will continue to follow this issue.

As these states get these groups underway, I will keep you posted.  We will 
have to take a close look at these and determine whether to get involved and 
if so, how.

Randy, Becky and I just had a conference call with John Kroeger, attorney in 
FERC's  Market Oversight and Enforcement Office, about the data request we 
just received from them regarding gas deals into California for May 2001.  We 
explained that the data request we just received was in many regards 
identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in 
January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how 
our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as 
they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for 
the new time frame, if we submit it.  (We may have to file written consent 
for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do).  
Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common 
sense (a refreshing notion).  He agreed that the"contracts" they want would 
just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame.  He also indicated a 
willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it 
in due course.  He will get back to us after he looks at the info already 
filed in the SDG&E complaint.

This is a follow up on the conference call during which Pam Hill of Mirant 
mentioned this documents.  MAAC's comments regarding RTOs future role in 
reliability standards could have a significant impact on the ongoing NERC 
organization standards process.  The NAERO working group will review these 
documents and consider what recommendations, if any, to make to the full 
Regulatory Affairs Committee.

Yesterday, I attended the public policy portion of the AISI conference in 
DC.   The meeting was very well attended, and it appeared that most of the 
attendees were executives.   The key takeaways were:

Senator Rockefeller's (D-WV) remarks:
He will do everything in his power to help domestic steel.
There is no "foaming desire" on behalf of the Administration to proceed with 
a 201.
The "best" 201 comes from the White House.
He urged the industry to get behind the 201 cause in a united fashion (a 
"united front is everything").
He has asked the Senate Finance committee to initiate a 201 
The Senator plans to introduce the "Save the American Steel Industry" bill 
this week.  The bill would:  (1) impose a 2% sales tax on steel sold in the 
US (both imports and exports); and (2) establish a $500 million fund to 
defray costs associated with mergers.  To be eligible for the merger fund, 
the company must retain 80% of the domestic blue collar work force and 
production capacity for 10 years after completion.

Flori Liser from USTR
The industry has long-term structural problems.
Why aren't US producers targeting other markets (ie, SE Asian markets) ?
Steel is a commodity (interesting statement coming from the USTR).
End-users (GM, Emerson Electric) have met with Trade (apparently on the 201 
issue), and have expressed concern about their competitive position.

A disturbing comment was made at the end of the conference.   One of the 
panelists, Roger Phillips of IPSCO, stated that foreign steel has a 
responsibility to know how their steel is being marketed in the US.   He 
stated further that we "should make steel traders responsible for what's 
going on", and that traders "should get financially hurt instead of someone 
else."  I am checking with outside counsel to find out exactly what was meant 
by this statement.

Please let me know if you have any questions.   

Lisa

Status of core/noncore proposal
Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing.
Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of "some 
parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal."
Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.

Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor
Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors)
They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats 
IOU past due) using their MOU numbers.
They said that the model "can work" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this 
is pretty consistent with our analysis).
Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me 
the results tomorrow AM.
Hertzberg is coming up with "additional" twists, however.
The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates 
down).
Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of 
additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B).
In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would 
issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't 
buy 20-year paper.
Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done 
by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in 
the event that credit isn't in place by July)

Conversation with the Chamber
The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of 
our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about, 
e.g., cost-shifting).
They were very appreciative, liked the features of our proposal (again) and 
we agreed to stay in close contact.

Finally, I have a call into Hertzberg to see what else I can learn.

Best,
Jeff

Unlike the past Administration where Secretary Richardson served as the lead 
on energy policy, the Bush Administration has created a new, interagency 
group to develop energy policy.  "The National Energy Policy Development 
Group"  was created for this purpose and will be lead by Vice President 
Cheney with former Senate Energy Committee Staff Director Andrew Lundquist 
serving as the group's director.  As such, rather than focusing our policy 
meetings at DOE, we should refocus instead on developing policy with this 
group which includes DOE, DOA, DOI, Treasury, etc.  Brian Malnak is the new 
Senate Energy Committee Staff Director.

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

"The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions."

"The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

"The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.

I am advised that at yesterday's ISO Board meeting, the ISO announced that it 
would be filing with FERC today their circuit breaker proposal and tariff 
language under section 205 as required by FERC's Order last week granting the 
Mirant complaint, even though they will not have obtained ISO Committee 
approval of these documents. That approval, required for a 205 filing,  is 
anticipated to occur at the special meeting of the Management Committee 
that's been scheduled for May 23rd. My understanding is that the ISO intends 
to ask FERC to expedite approval of the circuit breaker plan and tariffs by 
June 13 but will not seek to have the circuit breaker applied prior to a 
final FERC ruling. 
IPPNY is likely to file tomorrow a response opposing the request for 
expedited treatment. We should oppose this request as well. Clearly, the ISO 
is making a mockery of FERC's remand of the circuit breaker back to the ISO 
to get approval and resolve a number of issues that had been raised by 
parties in the Mirant docket. However, those issues were only the tip of the 
iceberg, as most parties treated the Mirant complaint as a challenge to the 
ISO's authority to proceed without FERC approval and didn't raise substantive 
concerns with the specifics of the ISO's circuit breaker proposal when they 
filed in the Mirant docket. There are many such issues and parties thought 
they would get discussed in the Committee review process that FERC had 
clearly contemplated would occur.

FYI.  You may have read that Calpine is close to reaching a deal with the 
state on its overcharges (about $240MM).  Note from structuring's analysis 
that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% 
of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.  That 
is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts 
account for about $4.4B  So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets 
$4.4 B.  Nice work if you can get it.

  Ginger , please circulate this list rather than the earlier 
one.                               TOP 10 PRIORITIES                          
          1.  Alberta Power Purchase Agreements -  If Enron Canada is 
successful in the PPA auction, Enron Canada will have a very long position in 
the Alberta wholesale market; continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of  
good transmission and distribution tariffs,  and development of rules for 
Plan "B" ( for those units that received no bids) will be 
critical.                                   2.  Continued support for  
ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in 
identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the 
latter, work  with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re 
transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance 
opportunities for "Power by the Hour" and other distributed generation 
projects.)                              3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening 
- work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development 
of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the latter, 
working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for 
interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial  
opportunities that exist.)                                  4. Enhancement of 
wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario.                              
5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada  in better understanding rules 
applicable   to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and 
Alberta.                     6. Alberta Natrural Gas 
Unbundling.                                  7. Renewed focus on potential 
for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the 
New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced  by a Liberal  
(pro-business) government in the province.                                
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE 
EFFECTIVE                                              1. Encourage 
government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to 
Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups 
in Houston. (In our case this would include 
Calgary).                               2. Replace or supplement the large 
group meetings with smaller meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can 
focus on issues of particular interest or enhance their understanding of a 
particular issue.  Seminars would be more in depth than what is possible in 
current group meeting format.                        3. Continue to enhance 
the information retrieval system so it  is easier to locate useful material 
(i.e. submissions, filings, etc.).                        4. Continue to 
emphasize to the commercial group  (at all levels) the value to Enron of  
involving  government affairs in every major transaction  (value enhancing, 
risk mitigating) -  this should become the practice rather than the 
exception.

Subject: Update on GridFlorida and TCCs

Steve ,

The following is a quick update on  two important  issues ;

GridFlorida ....As you know from my last update we have a very good "Market 
Representation " on the Advisory Committee and at the first meeting last week 
we formed a Market Design Working Group (MDWG) to work on developing an 
improved Market Design in Florida. I have been voted in as the Chairman of 
the committee and our first order of business will be to improve the 
Congestion Management proposals and to develop a Real Time Energy Spot Market 
with "uncovered" and "unbalanced " schedules  . We now have the right  people 
in place and the real battle now begins .
.

TCCs..............We did very well and continue to grow the  business .The 
results of the winter TCCs season are now tabulated and they are as follows ;



Rev Bids  Nov   Dec  Jan  Feb   Mar  Apr  Total Revenue Winter Period

  337K   483K  932K  311K  552K  695K  928K               $4,238,000

       311K  552K  695K  928K   $2,486,000


We have expanded our portfolio for the upcoming summer period and expect to

$10 million for calendar 2001.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

Former State ECD Head Gets Bush's TVA Nod

by Nicki Pendleton Wood

Wednesday, 7/11/2001 4:12 pm -

The White House today announced that President George W. Bush intends to 
nominate Knoxville businessman Bill Baxter to the board of Tennessee Valley 
Authority to serve out the remainder of Craven Crowell's term. His term will 
expire on May 18, 2002.

Mr. Baxter served as commissioner of the Tennessee Department of
Economic and Community Development after being appointed in 1997 by
Gov. Don Sundquist. He announced his resignation in December 2000.

He is chairman of Holston Gases, Inc., in Knoxville. Holston Gases sells
industrial and medical gases, propane, and welding supplies in seven cities
across the state.

Mr. Baxter has degrees from the University of Tennessee Law School and
Duke University.

Mr. Baxter has been an active donor to Republican causes. He gave $2000
to Bush for President in 1999; $2000 to Friends of Zach Wamp in 1997;
$1000 to Van Hilleary for Congress in 1997 and $500 to Van Hilleary for
Congress in 1998; $2000 to Frist 2000, Inc. in 1997; $1,000 to Rudolph
Giuliani's exploratory bid for New York senatorial seat (against Hillary
Clinton); and $2,499 to KOMPAC (Keep Our Majority Political Action) in
two separate gifts this year.

		 Subject: Hendricks


The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Here's the draft letter for Locke and a summary of the bill (FYI).   The 
pertinent section of the bill is section 3--although other sections of the 
bill may provide opportunities for:

 EES:  state agencies and school districts are required to complete energy 
audits and implement cost-effective conservation, with performance contracts 
being the preferred method; and
ENA:  utilities (both COUs and IOUs) must offer renewable energy products to 
customers.

We need to get our letter in the hopper ASAP.  Please ask Ginger to fed ex 
the signed letter to our lobbyist Mark Greenberg so Mark can deliver it to 
the Governor's office.    Mark's address is 

2205 East Bay Drive
Olympia, Washington 98506
360.786.9600

(Have fed ex leave it at Mark's door if he isn't there.)



There is some concern that Locke will line item veto portions of the bill as 
it was a last-minute compromise.    However, his support appears to be 
holding for the entire package.  

I'm in the office tomorrow (Weds) and in Sacto on Thursday.  Give me a call 
if you have any questions.

I have been called by Simon Rosenberg at the NDN.  He said that things are 
deteriorating for many of his members who want to take a balanced approach on 
the crisis.  He said their internal polling have energy issues and their 
impact on the environment on thee top of the priority list in the New Dem 
districts.  Simon reported the surge in interest in energy is shocking.  He 
said Lieberman may have come out early in support of price caps and 
investigations...but others may follow.  

Chuck Alston with the DLC called the same day to tell me that they are 
hearing similar concerns from several New Democrats and Chuck said they may 
be pushed into supporting cost-of-service-based rate making.  He and Will 
Marshall REALLY do not want to do this. I told him that we would oppose this 
and that we wanted to work with them to find other solutions.

Note that the NDN is hosting an energy event in late June where we will be 
listed as co-host as an executive committee member.  I told Megan that making 
it a fundraiser was not a good idea, instead make it a membership recruitment 
event.

NDN is planning an energy industry breakfast for June 21st at the AGA.  We
have several Members of Congress on board and are pushing to get at least
one Senator.  There has been some debate on how to do this event.  We're
wavering between couching it as a NDN members only event (hence making it a
fundraiser) or we can open it to all energy companies (hence making it a
prospecting event.)  I thought I would run this by you and get your thoughts
on it.  Any feedback you can give would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

PG&E press call summary:

chose BK Court b/c concluded that BK venue was better than continuing in 
State political process - the decision was made after listening to Gov's 
speech last night and concluding that were getting only words, not actions.  
No face-to-face meetings for over 3 weeks.  Negotiations "going nowhere" and 
state has "broken promises." Gov's negotiators said they wanted to deal w/ 
SCE before resuming talks w/ PG&E.  The BK court is the fairest venue to 
ensure that all creditors are treated fairly, will stabilize situation, and 
best way to deal w/ power crisis. 

notified State of impending crisis last summer - negotiations have been 
ongoing since November

Reasons for filing:  current rates not covering full net open position -  
un-reimbursed wholesale power costs to ISO grown to $300 million/month; PUC 
order obligates then to pay full QF costs but rates insufficient by $100 
million/month; CDWR-related costs not quantified yet; mentioned "illegal 
accounting procedures" ordered b y the PUC.

District Court case on filed rate arguments will go forward - believe they 
will win and that all creditors will be paid.

Recent rate hikes ordered by CPUC will go into effect but BK court will have 
to decide where the $$ goes.  CPUC and BK "will probably have some 
interesting conversations" about authority to set rates. 

Top creditors are listed in BK petition

No change in service to customers

Doesn't anticipate more lawsuits against suppliers - FERC is proper forum for 
those claims

Rockefeller Asks Senate Finance to Act
Against Steel Imports Under Section 201

Sen. John D. Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) said May 16 that he has asked the Senate 
Finance Committee to take action that could prompt the United States to 
restrict imports of steel from other countries--a move likely to be supported 
by the second-ranking Republican on the committee but opposed by its 
chairman. 
Saying he is running out of patience with the Bush administration, 
Rockefellor told reporters he has asked the committee to urge the U.S. 
International Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the cause of 
rising steel imports, which could result in President Bush's temporarily 
imposing import restrictions against the European Union, Japan, South Korea, 
and other countries under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act. 
"I've written the Finance Committee," he said, "asking for the initiation of 
a Section 201." 
Earlier this month, Rockefeller wrote President Bush asking him to initiate 
an ITC investigation under Section 201, noting that several U.S. steel 
companies had reported substantial losses in the first quarter of this year. 
"I am writing to let you know that we are in a do-or-die situation," 
Rockefeller wrote. "Failure to act now will be deadly. ...[T]he only 
immediate relief for the steel crisis is for you to initiate action under 
Section 201." 
Rockefeller said May 16 he also plans to introduce broader legislation May 17 
aimed at providing relief to the U.S. steel industry. He did not rule out 
eventually attaching the measure to the tax bill now working its way through 
Congress but said, "Let me get it introduced first." 

Bush Nominee Notes Possible Action

Earlier May 16, President Bush's nominee for a deputy U.S. trade 
representative slot, Peter Allgeier, said at a confirmation hearing of the 
Senate Finance Committee that the Bush administration was looking "very, very 
seriously" at possible action under Section 201. 
"I would like to assure you that [the administration is] looking very, very 
seriously at the issue of a possible 201 as part of our response to a very 
urgent problem," Allgeier said. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick has provided members of Congress 
with similar assurances on several occasions since taking office earlier this 
year. On May 10, for instance, he told a House Appropriations subcommittee 
that a decision on possible Section 201 safeguard action should be made 
"within a matter of months or sooner." 
For his part, Sen. Charles F. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee, 
said he would be "reluctant" to support committee action on the issue. 
"I would be reluctant to do that," he said. "I think our committee ought to 
be seen as honest brokers in that effort." 
Grassley told reporters he has been approached by "outside interests" that 
have urged him to back a committee request to the ITC on steel imports. 
"My message to them has been to work through the administration or file your 
own private action," he said. 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking Republican on the committee, said he 
would "probably" support Rockefeller's plan for the committee to 
"self-initiate" action under Section 201. 
"I don't want to be unfair to other countries," Hatch told reporters, "but I 
sure as heck don't want them to be unfair to us either. ... I want the 
administration to be on notice that we're watching them." 

Senate Letter on AD, CVD Laws

Grassley, meanwhile, told reporters he did not sign the letter from 61 
senators to President Bush earlier this month saying they will oppose any 
international trade agreement that would weaken U.S. laws aimed at protecting 
the U.S. market from unfair imports or unexpected import surges because a 
"worldwide discussion" of antidumping practices, for instance, "would benefit 
the United States more than it would benefit other countries." 
He said he opposes efforts being made by some members of Congress to require 
the Bush administration to ensure that U.S. antidumping and countervailing 
duty laws were "off the table" in multilateral trade negotiations under the 
World Trade Organization. 
"I don't think we have anything to fear having it on the table," Grassley 
said. 
Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, argue that U.S. trade laws 
have been used for protectionist purposes and have proposed revisiting the 
issue in the WTO. 
Allgeier, meanwhile, said that U.S. trade laws actually promote trade 
liberalization. 
"American manufacturers, farmers, and workers will feel more confident with 
trade negotiations if they feel that they have recourse to address these 
unfair trade practices by our trading partners," he said. "And so we do not 
have any intention of weakening U.S. trade remedy laws in our negotiations." 
Allgeier said that the United States cannot prevent other countries from 
bringing up the issue in trade talks. 

Little Progress Made on TPA

Grassley also told reporters May 16 he hopes that the Senate Finance 
Committee will be able to consider and approve legislation next month to 
renew the president's trade promotion authority, formerly known as "fast 
track." But he said that little progress has been made in discussions between 
his staff and the staff of Sen. Max S. Baucus (D-Mont.), the ranking Democrat 
on the committee, particularly concerning the contentious issue of labor and 
environmental protection in the context of trade agreements. 
"Our staffs have been talking on a very regular basis," Grassley said, "but 
that's not to say that there's been progress made." 
He said, however, he was still hopeful that the legislation could be cleared 
by the end of June, then approved by the full Senate before the next 
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, scheduled to be held in 
Qatar Nov. 9-13. 
Also testifying at the Finance Committee hearing on May 16, President Bush's 
nominee for U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Linnet F. Deily, said that if 
confirmed, she plans to begin meeting immediately with representatives of 
other WTO member countries in Geneva-- "hoping to build relationships based 
on trust and candor." 
"I look forward to working with other WTO members to try and find common 
ground or reconcile our disparate positions, while always representing the 
strength of the U.S. position," she said. "I would like to understand other 
perspectives while being a forceful advocate for our U.S. positions."

regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
"go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.

After talking briefly this morning to Paul D and Doug, I suggest the 
following agenda for our discussion:
 1. Brown/ Sherriff announcement and accompanying "organisation chart"
  - mistakes 
  - other opinions (lack of consultation), optimising efficiency
  - geographic v. business v. functional division of responsibilities
  - business and functional reporting lines
  - further communication with other team members in London
 2. Practical day to day/ week to week matters
  - budget (review planned for early May)
  - existing and potential recruitment 
  - Kean weekly call participation 
  - Sherriff weekly meeting participation
  - London staff meetings
  - Enron Europe weekly report 
  - other intra-group and business communication needs
I have invited Jan to join the call, since the announcement did not call for 
him to report to any of those of us located in London/ Brussels/ Frankfurt.

Highlights:

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
In giving its first hint on what it will do with the PX credit process, it 
said "we will proceed to reexamine and redesign the direct access credit 
system to reflect current structural reality."  (Translation - no 
market-based PX credits)
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law). Responsibility for residential 
subsidy is split one third each to residential, commercial, and industrial
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers put in place.  No increase up to 130% of 
baseline (first 2 tiers), rate for fifth tier (above 300% of baseline) is 
about doubled.
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Industrial customers get a bill limiter which caps the average increase for a 
given customer to 12.3 cents/kwh for PG&E and 12.9 cents/kwh for SCE.
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
Federal facilities will be subject to a market rate pilot program.
Utilities are directed to specifically state on each bill the energy charges, 
including the 3 cent surcharge


Below is a more complete summary of the CPUC decision on the PG&E/SCE rate 
increase (prepared by Jeanne Bennett).

All:

Attached is the latest version.    Note the average price of power assumed 
purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent for the 9.5 
years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's forward price 
curves are used.  We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in our sensitivity 
page.   The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and DWR curves.   Enron's 
curves are significantly lower on the back-end.   The other switch is for the 
allocation of the past utility purchases: 1) one pro rata, and 2)  one where 
the non-core shares prorata, plus half the core's portion.  DWR past 
purchases are handled pro rata in both scenarios.


Regards,


Michael

Subject: EPower Regulatory situation

John, after two preliminary meetings with EPower project managers on 
regulatory issues and several discussions with Carey, it is clear that a lot 
of work needs to be done on the regulatory front for EPower. For a start, we 
need to go back and address the fundamentals:
 the implications of Japan's deregulating market on forward power prices
 the permits required for construction and operation of power plants and 
related facilities, and the time needed  to obtain those permits
 the ability to access the transmission network at the preferred sites in a 
timely and cost effective manner

Over the next few weeks, I will be undertaking a comprehensive regulatory 
review and will develop a lobbying strategy to address each of the barriers 
to timely development of EnCom's projects. Having said that, there is a real 
possibility that the permitting process cannot be shortened within an 
acceptable time frame, or that an assessment of forward power prices suggests 
that under certain scenarios it would be uneconomical to proceed with 
development of one or more of the projects.

Forward Power Prices. EPower is currently using a projected forward power 
price for 2007 and beyond based on the price paid by TEPCO to IPPs in 
1995/96. Deregulation is inevitable in Japan and international experience 
suggests that a period of significantly lower wholesale power prices will 
likely follow, particularly given that Japan is likely to be in generation 
surplus until at least 2010.

Permitting. EPower has indicated that it recently discovered that the 
permitting process for Aomori project will take 7 years to complete, without 
a significant lobbying effort. Prior to that, EPower believed that permitting 
would take 3 years. Again, EPower based the 3 year permitting estimate on the 
estimates of bidders in the 1995/ 96 IPP program. However, most of the IPP 
proposals involved repowering of existing plants which reduced the permitting 
time. In addition, the IPP program commenced prior to the introduction of the 
current environmental laws.    

Transmission Access. EPower has said that Chugoku Electric advised them that 
it will take approximately 10 years and in the order of US$200m to connect 
the proposed Ube plant to the transmission system. In addition, we have 
preliminary indications that Tohoku Electric are looking at a similar time 
frame to connect the Aomori project to the grid.

We have already started to address the transmission access issue. EPower 
acknowledges that it needs a better understanding of the dynamics of the 
transmission system to address in a meaningful way the concerns raised by the 
utilities on connection to the transmission system. Both EPower and Enron 
Japan have sufficient primary information on the transmission system for 
David Mason in the London office to develop a dynamic model. Armed with the 
information from the model, together with a more thorough understanding of 
the rules of connection to the transmission system, we aim to be in a 
position to negotiate in a more meaningful way with the relevant utilities.

Project Valuation. These issues have a direct bearing on what I understand 
EnCom's value proposition to be - to take first mover advantage in Japan to 
build, own and operate power plants in Japan more efficiently than the 
incumbents. After almost twenty months operating in Japan, it may be timely 
for EnCom to review this proposition.

I have proposed to Carey that in conjunction with the regulatory review that 
he arrange for a reassessment of Encom's projects using a robust and 
objective approach with input from  Ariga (Domestic plant development),  Andy 
Foote/ Ed Cattigan (International plant development) and Jane McBride 
(legal). As part of that reassessment, I have suggested that EPower price the 
typical risks associated with project development  - financing, construction, 
commodity, operating, market, legal, regulatory and political risk with a 
view to making a financial assessment of each project on a best case, worst 
case and mid case scenario. 

The aim is to lay all the development risks out now so that we can make an 
informed decision on projects and quickly assess the implications of events 
as they arise through the course of project development.

John, it would be good to talk about these issues prior to the EPower 
conference call on Wednesday. Today is a holiday in Japan, but feel free to 
contact me at home or alternatively, I will be in the office Tuesday. My 
contact numbers are as follows:

Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 
against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its 
wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed 
protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and 
Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to 
file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility 
requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes 
a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, 
without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load 
exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate 
against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a 
perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices.

Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's 
proceeding.

Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the 
current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid 
south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of

One comments, as the DWR projections indicate, their price projection of spot 
(non-contracted) is not where the enter into their contracted amounts (notice 
non-contracted stays above contracted).     Thus you do not see an MTM 
reduction over time.

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

I tracked down some old books and ran into a few good quotations to make some 
slides either critical of price controls in practice or showing how the 
economics profession has been opposed to maximum price ceilings.

> Financial Analysts: Summary
> 
> The host of the teleconference was Mr. Joseph Fichera, CEO of Saber
> Partners (serving as Governor's independent Bond Counsel)
> 
> Mr. Fichera's goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the
> Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to
> market sometime in June.  Fichera told me yesterday that he does these
> calls on an "as needed" basis.  There appeared to be some concern that the
> "media is getting ahead of the story" and the inference could be made that
> this is causing problems for the Governor's MOU legislation (which they
> also said they hope to have signed by June) and perhaps for the emerging
> "Plan B" as well.  
> 
> A replay of this teleconference is available at www.energyinfo.ca.gov.ca
> 
> Mr. Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections:
> 
> California State Senate: Pieces of Governor's MOU legislation moving in
> separate committees; in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward.
> 
> Assembly Plan B Group: Assemblymembers Keeley, Dutra and Nation are
> working together and have good ideas to move the Governor's MOU
> legislation through.  Fichera said that the Governor's office is meeting
> with both parties but the plan is still in the  formative stages.  He
> added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the
> proposal is imminent.  They are hopeful that it will be "moving toward
> resolution in a week or two."
> 
> Generators: Fichera stated that since the Governor's meeting with the
> generators, a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governor's
> staff and advisors to resolve the issues.  He stated that the issue of
> litigation and investigations by the AG's office is "off the table" for
> discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and
> managing the coming summer.
> 
> QFs: Governor's team has facilitated 5 days of discussions with SCE and
> QFs over past two weeks; most QFs are represented at these negotiations.
> They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going
> forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market.  Their hope is
> that due to negotiations, the QFS will all be fully available to the
> market this summer.
> 
> PGE:  They see the bankruptcy judge's refusal to allow certain QFs to get
> out of their contracts as a positive development. 
> 
> QFs on-line: There are currently 700 MWs off-line; this is better than
> their model anticipated for May.  They expect more than 90%
> on-line by June.  Last month 1700 QF MWs off-line; Fichera explained that
> standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June 1 during
> peaks but that they are allowed to be off during off-peak hours.  He added
> that they are still trying to resolve their issues.
> 
> Key aspects of budget plan (by this I believe he meant energy financing,
> not the annual budget):  conservation and contracts
> 
> Conservation: They built in a 4% reduction in demand and 3% reduction for
> price elasticity--conservatively projecting  7% in conservation.  He
> stated the we saw 9% conservation in March and April, "so we think our
> model is conservative."  Fichera added that the new electricity rates go
> out in June and they expect that this will cause a "good reaction" due to
> price signals and demand reduction.
> 
> They also built in 2% in natural load growth to their projections as well
> to further ensure a conservative estimate.
> 
> Energy Costs: Projected ($1.78 billion) vs. actual ($1.80 billion) equals
> a variance of 1.4%
> 
> May Energy Costs:  As of May 6th, right on budget target, with a variance
> of less than a half percent
> 
> Contracts:  Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and
> reduce the net short exposure in the spot market.  He added that 10-20% of
> necessary contracts are not yet executed, but rather in the agreement in
> principal stage.  He released the following stats:
> 
> Needed executed contracts completed (these percentages must refer to
> projected load accounted for): 43% for May, 67% for June, 48% for July,
> 42% for August
> 
> When agreements in principle added in: 73% for June, 67% for July, 60% for
> August:
> 
> Questions from analysts:
> 
> Have you built-in an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of
> contracts?  "No, we do not because we are fighting the opt-out positions.
> The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to
> be involved to stop that.  A few hundred MWs have gone into the market.
> We are aware of this issue, which is why we're pushing the MOUs--this
> litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back
> payment issue would be settled."
> 
> Timing with SDG&E,  where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle?  We
> have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations   due to other decisions
> {happening simultaneously around us].  We are resuming face to face
> negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement.
> There is no drop dead date.
> 
> Generators working group? We're discussing DWR credit issues, summer,
> support for MOU--the generators have issues with outstanding payments due.
> The Governor expects them to provide haircut re: those payments and that's
> part of discussion.
> 
> QF resolution: will gas QFs be released from contracts?  We don't know
> what PG&E is going to do but they could do that-- release at any time--no
> indications yet--haven't affirmed all the contracts yet.  We want to avoid

Based on a series of meetings and discussions with many you, below is an 
outline of the proposed strategy for Com Ed.  I will be meeting with 
Commissioner Harvill and also the Commissioners' assistants on Wednesday to 
deliver our message, so if you have any comments on this, please get back to 
me as soon as possible.  (Com Ed is scheduled to meet with the Commissioners 
on Thursday).

The Facts - Customers currently have three rates to choose from: the fixed 
price bundled rate, the PPO which is a discount off the Fixed price bundled 
rate, or an alternative rate provided by a marketer (ARES).  Most of Enron's 
customers are on the PPO although some are on the bundled rate.  Com Ed sent 
a letter to the ICC in which they propose to replace the PPO with a spot 
market price plus  adder to be effective at the end of 2004.  Com Ed also 
acknowledges that with rising market prices, some of the industrial customers 
are or soon will no longer be paying a CTC.  With the relinquishment of the 
CTC obligation comes Com Ed's obligation to provide the PPO rate.  In 
conversations, Com Ed indicated that they would like to replace the fixed 
bundled price with a performance based rate at the end of 2004.  An internal 
analysis prepared by Mark Ulrich sets forth the negative impact of removing 
the PPO on our current book of business.

Issues of Concern:
 
 * Protection of our current book of business
 * Ability to physically deliver into Com Ed on a competitive basis
 * Potential for Default Service deal
 * Potential to market individual customers on a one-on-one basis

The Plan:

Our public position will be that without the capability to physically deliver 
power into the Com Ed market on a competitive basis, the PPO rate should not 
be lifted since customers are left without reasonable options or protection.

Our negotiated position in order of priority is as follows:

1.  Protect our current book of business.  We should negotiate a rate with 
Com Ed that leaves us whole.  This could include the provision by Com Ed of 
ancilliary services.  There is an FRP tariff rate that has expired but that 
we believe offered ancilliary services at a rate that allowed other marketers 
to physically deliver.  We are in the process of obtaining the tariff to see 
if that would work for us to negotiate from, even though it has expired.  In 
essence we want to negotiate a new PPO rate under which Com Ed continues to 
supply our existing customers or preferably that enables us to physically 
deliver to our customers at the same price as the PPO.  Mark Ulrich and Guy 
Sharfman are going to develop a rate that we can take to Com Ed for our 
entire book of business.

2.  Leverage new business opportunities for EES.  These opportunites include 
acquisition of all or a portion of Com Ed's industrial default customers as 
well as individual customer accounts.  (We believe that Com Ed wants to free 
itself from its obligation to serve industrial customers, so there may be an 
opportunity).   The concept is to fold these new customer acquisitions into 
the same deal negotiated for our current customers, allowing EES to expand 
its customer base and potentially its physical delivery capabilities.  From 
the standpoint of acquiring individual customers, we should advocate a real 
time price plus adder starting in 2003 for customers who roll off the CTC. 

3.  Push for Com Ed support of Enron's positions at the ARTO working level.  
Nothing in our agreements, however, with Com Ed should be contingent on the 
RTO functioning, such that Com Ed can have an out for its obligations to 
Enron under the deal.

Janine.

Rick, thanks for seeing me individually on Friday. 

There has not yet been any announcement for EBS. I welcome my new reporting 
to Sue Nord, but I would like to see some kind of official note on the new 
structure. I would like to know what my budget for Europe is and what the new 
procedures are for contracting outside counsels, or consultants.

As you may know, I have recently expressed interest with Anthony Duenner  for 
the vacant position with EBS Singapore. This mainly because there are more 
challenging regulatory issues at hand in the Asia/Pacific region and I have 
been able to familiarize myself with some of them, whereas in Europe this is 
not the case.

However, there are also some opportunities here, namely supporting Paul 
Hennemeyer on a part time basis. This mainly because my previous experience 
as competition lawyer might enable me to co-manage some of the court 
procedures currently pending. The recruitment for a German person with legal 
training only failed recently.

 I am basically open to pursue either opportunity, depending on what the 
company wants to me to do. My current job is for EBS Europe is not any longer 
a full time position, since I have secured all necessary licenses and our 
business is widely deregulated.

I copy Sue since I want this to be as transparent as possible & due to 
extensive travelling we have not been able to speak.

I wanted to give you the heads-up that Enron's name will appear in a Wall 
Street Journal article tomorrow on multipollutant.   

As I have discussed with most of you before, we have been working in a 
coalition of companies (temporarily named the "Clean Power Group") including 
El Paso, Trigen, Calpine and NiSource to develop legislative proposals on 
multipollutant emission reductions from the power generation sector.   The 
group has hired Dutko Group lobbying firm to help float some of our initial 
ideas in the Administration and on Capitol Hill.  Mark Irion of Dutko spoke 
with John Fialka at WSJ today and discussed some of our concepts.

Background -- we have developed ideas that focus on making emissions 
reductions in NOx, SO2, mercury and CO2 in exchange for regulatory reforms to 
the New Source Review program.  We have structured these proposals in a way 
that holds multiple benefits for Enron -- promoting development of new 
generation, providing incentives to use new technologies and a diverse fuel 
mix, and environmental benefits with economic protections.  This is also an 
issue of competitiveness, as the big, regulated utilities with high-emitting 
grandfathered sources are trying to mold these issues in a way that would 
disadvantage new entrants.  We have had very positive discussions with many 
in the Administration and on the Hill, and are hoping some of our ideas are 
embraced in energy task force reports, legislation, etc.   

Note on CO2 -- the multipollutant debate has changed somewhat since Bush took 
CO2 caps "off the table" for the U.S. power sector.   We are not forwarding 
ideas that say "we must include CO2 caps", rather we are saying we can do 
multipollutant effectively and economically -- if policymakers want to 
include CO2, we can show them how to do it without causing economic collapse.

We plan to discuss this issue in more detail with many Corp and commercial 
groups at our Emissions Strategy Meeting, which now looks like it will be 
held on May 18 in Houston.  Please let me know if you have questions or need 
additional information.

Please feel free to forward to anyone else you believe should see this note.

Thanks,

Jeff

Greetings:
As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.  
As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background 
and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during 
his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others 
have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try 
to advance the ball.

I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all 
errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make 
sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, 
but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any 
comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M
N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and 
"noncore" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. 
"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution." 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote." 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

Hello! Rick,

Last year, I worked closely with Ricardo on the reorganization of the 
electric industry, with the electricity transition team (Fox's group) and 
with regulatory summaries of various countries. 

Since February, I have been working very closely with Jos, Antonio Aguilar 
(Director EBS Mexico),  in the concession granting process, visiting 
companies and all the telecommunication companies in Mexico ( data centers, 
local loop and long haul providers, etc).  Mexico is the second largest 
telecommunications market for the United States after Canada, this represents 
a big opportunity for EBS. and Jos, Antonio has proposed me to work a 100% 
with EBS, and I would like to know how do you see this.  I already spoke 
about this with Ricardo and he told me to discuss it with you. 

On the other hand, about the Government Affairs meeting in Denver I would 
like to ask you if I should go.

Best regards, Kikumi

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: May 1, 2001

RE: FERC's April 26th Order Establishing Prospective
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for California Wholesale
Electric Markets

On April 26th, FERC issued an Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and 
Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets.  EPSA has 
previously forwarded FERC's press release outlining the major features of the 
Order, along with a brief e-mail explaining one confusing aspect of the 
Order.  This memo provides a more in-depth analysis of the Order.  In 
addition, we need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or 
clarification of any aspect of this Order.  Filings would be due at FERC no 
later than Tuesday, May 29th.  Based on a review of the order, there are 
issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing, which are outlined below.  We will 
discuss these issues on an upcoming weekly conference call.  If you have 
additional issues you want EPSA to raise, please forward them to Julie Simon 
at 202-628-8200 or at jsimon@epsa.org.

APRIL 26th ORDER

In this Order, the Commission puts into place a market monitoring and 
mitigation plan for real-time energy markets in California that is intended 
to replace the $150/MWh "breakpoint" plan adopted in the December 15th 
Order.  The mitigation plan will go into effect May 29th, with the current 
$150/MWh breakpoint and refund approach continued for an additional month.  
Except for the demand-side bidding program, the plan will terminate not later 
than one year from the date of the Order.  However, the monitoring and 
mitigation requirements are contingent on the three California utilities and 
the CAISO making an RTO filing, consistent with the requirements of Order No. 
2000, by June 1, 2001.

The Order also initiates a Section 206 investigation into the rates, terms 
and conditions of public utility sales for resale of electric energy in the 
WSCC, other than through the CAISO markets, for all sales in "real-time spot 
markets" (defined as up to 24 hours in advance) and when contingency reserves 
for any control area fall below 7 percent.

The Commission states that its goal was to address the need for mitigation 
"in as market-oriented a manner as possible," so as not to discourage needed 
infrastructure investment, while allowing price signals to create demand 
response.

The Order includes the following requirements:

1. Coordination and Control of Outages

To ensure adequate capacity, the Order stresses the need for the CAISO and 
generators to work cooperatively to schedule unit maintenance and outages.  
The Commission stresses that the CAISO's requirements for outage coordination 
need to "foster cooperation, rather than establish punitive provisions either 
penalizing generators or the ISO."   The Order requires the CAISO to make a 
tariff filing within 15 days proposing a mechanism for the coordination and 
control of outages, including periodic reports to the Commission.  Comments 
on the tariff filing will be due within 5 days.

2. Selling Obligations

In creating a must-offer obligation, the Commission's goal is to ensure that 
all generating units that are able to run, but are not scheduled in 
real-time, will in fact be made available to the CAISO in the real-time 
markets.  Therefore, the Order requires that:

all generators with Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs),
all sellers selling into the CAISO markets that own generation in California,
and
all sellers using the CAISO tariffs that own generation in California

offer the CAISO all of their capacity in real-time during all hours it is 
available and not already scheduled to run through bilateral agreements.  The 
scope of this requirement includes non-jurisdictional, non-public utility 
generators.  Stressing that "all generators need to participate in helping to 
solve the problems in California," the Commission concludes that a generator 
that has capacity available in real-time would, under competitive conditions, 
be willing to sell that energy "at a price that covers its marginal costs."  
All generators are also subject to the price mitigation plan as well, 
including the required filing of heat rate and emission data described below.

The Commission also clarifies certain issues.  First, no generator will be 
required to run in violation of its certificate or applicable law.  However, 
the Commission finds that environmental limitations are state-imposed and the 
question of whether units can run outside proscribed environmental limits and 
at what cost are within the control of the state.  Generators will be 
permitted to recover environmental mitigation costs, presumably by justifying 
a bid above the proxy price.  Second, because of its unique characteristics, 
hydroelectric power is exempt from this requirement.

Finally, the Commission rejects the concerns of generators that they need to 
withhold capacity to cover the risk of a generating unit tripping off line.  
In that circumstance, the generator will pay no more than the real-time 
market clearing price to replace that energy, which is what it is being paid 
to make the energy available to the CAISO.  Thus, it should be indifferent to 
selling all available capacity into the CAISO real-time market.

3. Demand Response

Each public utility purchasing power in the CAISO's real-time market will be 
required, by June 1, to submit demand-side bids indicating the price at which 
load will be curtailed and identify that load.  The bids are to include the 
maximum price that the purchaser is willing to pay for specific amounts of 
energy and the loads on its system that will be curtailed when the real-time 
energy price exceeds that bid.  This is the only aspect of the Commission's 
plan that will not expire within one year.

4. Price Mitigation in the Real-time Auction During Reserve
Deficiencies

During all periods when Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies are in effect (i.e., when 
reserves fall below 7.5 percent), certain price mitigation procedures will 
apply to the market clearing auction for the real-time market.  The following 
explains those as we understand them.  The language in the order is quite 
confusing and may be open to more than one interpretation.

First, all gas-fired generators are required to submit to the Commission and 
the CAISO, on a confidential basis, the heat rate and emission rate for each 
generator.  Second, each day by 8:00 a.m., the CAISO will publish a daily gas 
price, using an average of the daily prices published in the prior day's Gas 
Daily for all California delivery points.  The CAISO will also publish an 
emission cost using data from Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage 
Services, also for the prior day.  In establishing the market clearing price 
for its real-time market, the CAISO will calculate the fuel and emission 
costs for the marginal unit, using the previously supplied confidential data 
and the published gas and emission costs, plus a $2.00 add-on for operating 
and maintenance expenses.  That calculated cost or proxy price for the 
marginal unit will be used to set the market clearing price for that hour.

Any generator that submits a bid higher than the proxy price calculated by 
the CAISO will be paid what it bids, subject to refund and justification, but 
that bid will not set the market clearing price.  Any generator that submits 
a bid lower than the proxy price will receive the market clearing price and 
not be subject to any refund liability.  Justification of higher prices must 
be submitted to the Commission within 7 days of the end of the month and must 
include a detailed breakdown of all of the component costs.  Opportunity 
costs may not be included because of the Commission's belief that no 
opportunity costs exist in real-time markets.

Bids from resources outside California can elect the market-clearing price or 
submit their own bids.  Those bids will not be used to set the 
market-clearing price.  In addition, marketers can elect the market-clearing 
price or submit their own bids.  Bids above the market-clearing price must be 
justified based on the prices paid for power.

5. Conditions on Market-based Rate Authority

The Order raises new concerns about certain bidding practices that may 
suggest anticompetitive behavior.  The Commission specifically identifies two 
types of prohibited bidding practices that will be subject to increased 
scrutiny, refunds and/or suspension of market based rate authority.  The 
first prohibited bidding practice occurs when bids vary with unit output in a 
manner that is unrelated to the known performance characteristics of the 
unit.  Known as "hockey stick" bids, this involves bids where the last 
megawatts are bid at excessively high prices relative to the other capacity 
from the unit.  The other identified prohibited practice involves bids that 
vary over time in a manner that appears unrelated to changes in the unit's 
performance or changes in the supply environment that would induce additional 
risk.  This type of bidding increases prices only in response to increased 
demand or reduced reserve margins, and it timed to public announcements of 
system conditions or outages in the bidder's portfolio.

6. Monitoring

The CAISO will be required to provide the Commission with weekly reports of 
CAISO schedule, outage and bid data.  The CAISO is to identify any concerns 
it has about bidding practices in those weekly reports.  The Commission is 
maintaining the current six month time period for keeping bid information 
confidential.

On September 14th, and quarterly thereafter, the CAISO is required to file a 
report with the Commission analyzing how the mitigation plan is operating, as 
well as the progress made in developing new generation and demand side 
response.  Comments on the CAISO reports will be due within 15 days.

7. CAISO Market Stabilization Plan

The Commission offered little comment on the CAISO's market stabilization 
plan, but does note that the proposals for day-ahead and hour-ahead energy 
markets go beyond the scope of this proceeding and should be filed under 
Section 205 so that all parties can review the proposals.  The CAISO is 
specifically directed not to go forward with any plans, such as the purchase 
of computer equipment or software, until the Commission has reviewed and 
accepted the filing.  In an unrelated section, the Commission notes that it 
will "address allegations about the ISO's lack of independence and its 
governance procedures in a later order."

8. Escrow for Past Unpaid Bills

The Commission invites comments, within 30 days, on whether the CAISO should 
be required to institute, on a prospective basis, a surcharge on power sales 
that would be maintained in an escrow account to cover the three IOUs' unpaid 
bills to generators.   The Commission specifically seeks comments on whether 
increased production would be tied to an increased likelihood that generators 
will be paid.

9. West-Wide 206 Investigation

As noted above, the Commission is instituting an investigation into the 
rates, terms and conditions of public utility sales of electric energy in the 
WSCC other than through the CAISO markets.  The investigation is limited to 
energy sold in what the Commission terms real-time spot markets, which is 
defined as 24 hours in advance, and under conditions when contingency 
reserves, as defined by the WSCC, for any control area fall below 7 percent.

The Commission also invites comments on whether the must-offer and price 
mitigation rules contained in this Order for California should be applied to 
the WSCC.  Comments are due May 10th and EPSA is preparing draft comments for 
members to review shortly.

POSSIBLE AREAS FOR REHEARING AND/OR CLARIFICATION

There are several areas where EPSA may want to seek rehearing and/or 
clarification of the Commission's Order.

Given the current make-up of the CAISO Board, we have grave concerns about 
releasing confidential heat rate and emission data to the CAISO.  Since the 
Board is clearly working at the behest of the Governor, that commercially 
sensitive data could easily end up with DWR, which is actively negotiating 
contracts to purchase power from these units.  In addition, we have concerns 
about the CAISO's ability to protect this data since similarly confidential 
information from the CAISO's market monitoring unit has appeared in the Los 
Angeles Times.  The Commission should ensure that only an independent entity, 
not the CAISO, have access to this data.

The actual operation of the price mitigation is confusing and amenable to 
several interpretations.  The Commission should clarify, possibly with 
examples, how the market-clearing price will be calculated and the effect of 
the market-clearing price on a variety of bids.

The discussion of second category of prohibited bids is unclear.  The 
Commission appears to be saying that bids that value scarcity are prohibited, 
but this makes little economic or practical sense.

Do we agree with the Commission's conclusion that a generator is indifferent 
(in real-time) to receiving the market clearing price for its as-available 
energy, when it may need to energy to self-supply reserves if a unit trips 
off?  Are there operational concerns that make this economic trade-off 
unworkable?  We will need to educate the Commission if we want to raise this 
issue.

Dramatic drop in cost of electricity/LOWER BILLS: Cheaper fuel, milder 
weather credited
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer


   California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest
level in more than a year, partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in
prices for natural gas, which fuels most power plants.
   Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in
months ahead.
   But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last
summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally
may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs.
   "California is not yet out of the woods," said Kelley Doolan, who tracks
natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. "But this is a
very significant decrease in costs."
   Along with lower gas prices, the decline in electricity costs was
attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather, which
reduces demand for power. They also credited recent conservation efforts
by consumers and better-than-expected runoff at dams for hydroelectric
plants.
   Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an
energy-industry association, said these factors came together to produce
the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April 2000.
   Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as
little as $50 per megawatt hour, he noted, compared with more than $500
earlier this year.
   "If the weather stays this way, we could have reasonable prices all
summer, " Ackerman said. "We may also have fewer blackouts."
   It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in
energy prices. If power companies manipulated prices on the way up, as
critics have alleged, might they not be up to some trick as prices head in
the opposite direction?
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco, speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to
fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active
role in the dysfunctional California market.
   "They're trying to take the heat off," she said.
   Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a
statistical blip.
   "This was just one month's decline," said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "We really
have to see how this plays out in the future."
   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor was
very encouraged by the lower energy prices. Davis announced Sunday that
California's power use was down 11 percent last month from a year before.
   "We're not there yet," Maviglio said of whether an end to the state's
power woes is in sight. "But the trend is pointing in the right
direction."
   WHITE ELEPHANT
   Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side: California
could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about $40 billion
in public funds on long-term power contracts.
   The logic behind the contracts, which are at an average price of $69 per
megawatt hour over 10 years, is that the state expected to pay
below-market rates for electricity for a number of years before prices
came down and California found itself paying above-market rates.
   If current trends continue, though, California will find itself paying
consistently above-market rates much sooner than expected, making the
long- term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that
profited so handsomely during the state's darkest hours.
   "The contracts look really ugly right now," said Shames at the Utility
Consumers' Action Network. "They may be way overpriced."
   Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said it is too early to conclude that
the state did poorly negotiating dozens of long-term power contracts.
   "No one has a crystal ball on this," he said.
   CUSTOMERS' BILLS TO DROP
   In any case, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that customers'
average gas bills will drop 26 percent this month to $26 and should stay
near that level all summer.
   Platts, which monitors average monthly spot prices, found that the
wholesale price of gas at the California-Oregon border has tumbled nearly
42 percent since the beginning of May -- from $9.98 per million British
thermal units to $5.81.
   The wholesale gas price at the California-Arizona border fell 45 percent,
from $11.91 to $6.50. This compares with a 25 percent monthly decline in
average natural gas prices nationwide.
   However, California gas prices are still about 50 percent higher than they
were a year ago, whereas national prices are now below year-ago levels for
the first time since last spring.
   While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall,
Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a
commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long, hot
summer of rolling blackouts.
   "You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer,"
he said. "That created enormous demand for electricity generation.
   "What has changed is that we've had weeks of mild weather," Doolan
observed.
   "The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up
all the gas."
   This allowed utilities like PG&E to beef up gas inventories, which eased
demand and resulted in substantially lower prices, he said.
   'BACK ON TRACK'
   "We're back on track to be completely full for winter," said Staci Homrig,
a PG&E spokeswoman. "That's a very good thing."
   Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again
in the winter. PG&E is forecasting that customers' average gas bills could
rise to as high as $75 in December if current trends continue.
   However, the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that
California's unusually high costs at last may be abating.
   Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether
the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs.

       Gas Issues Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            John Orr, Gas Issues Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Jack Cashin, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: June 12, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Commission's Proposed
      Reporting Requirement on Natural Gas Sales to California
      Market
         ?Comments  to EPSA  by Friday, June 15th, 12:00 p.m.
          (EST)
         ?Filing Due June 18th

Attached are draft EPSA comments in response to the Commission's proposed 
requirements on natural gas sales to the California market.  The Commission 
is proposing that market participants (including pipelines and LDCs) submit 
quarterly reports on price and volume data on physical transactions.   EPSA's 
comments focus on four key issues:

   ?The reporting requirements represent an unnecessary burden;

   ?The information requested has proprietary and confidential aspects;

   ?Increased reporting requirements will not adequately address gas
    infrastructure needs in California; and

   ?If reporting requirements are imposed, a sunset date should provide a
    definite end to the filing obligation.

As discussed on the Gas Issues Working Group call on June 7th, members asked 
that EPSA file these comments.

Comments are due at FERC on Monday, June 18th.  In order to ensure we file on 
time, please forward any comments by noon on Friday, June 15th to Jack Cashin 
at 202-628-8200 or jcashin@epsa.org.

I anticipate that GPG management will be asked at several upcoming industry 
meetings to comment on the reasons for and implications of rising natural gas 
prices.  Attached is a  proposed set of talking points for use in Q&A and 
briefing materials.    Please let me know if you find these message points to 
be consistent with our general Enron response to pricing inquiries.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee asked Enron to support the Congressional Black Caucus 
"energy" field trip trip to Houston on Jun 28-30, 2001.  She said was going 
to call Ken Lay, but Rosalee has not taken a call.

API has been asked to coordinate the meeting and they have hired a event 
planning firm.  Jackson Lee has made it clear she wants Enron involved even 
thought were are not APIMembers.  API would like to bring the CBC to the 
Enron trading floor and gas control room.   Jackson Lee would also like to 
have Ken Lay attend a roundtable discussion on June 29. There will be several 
lavish social events which we will be inivited to attend.   We will also be 
asked to contribute to the trip.....my guess is that we are looking at over 
$40,000.

Jim Ford at API is coordinating the trip.  He will be in contact with me next 
week with more information.

Sorry the info. is so sketchy, but that is all there is so far.

Although Ken did not have an opportunity to raise steel directly with the 
Vice President because of time constraints, Ken did take an opportunity to 
speak with Bob Zoellick directly and at length about steel.  We ran into 
Zoellick in the West Wing as we were departing.  Zoellick told Ken that he 
understood our position.  He indicated general agreement with us, but did say 
that if he is able to "trade" steel for a larger political deal on fast track 
or something of that level, he would entertain putting steel into play.  
Zoellick indicated that he would glad to have his senior staff visit with us 
further on the issue.  Zoellick did not want to meet officially with us, 
given his former role as a Member of Enron's Advisory Committee.

Hello All-

I wanted to let you know that, as of July 1, Jan Haizmann's responsibilities 
will expand to include competition issues in European energy markets.  As you 
know, in addition to his work for EBS in Europe, Jan has been spending 
considerable time directing EBS' government affairs work in Asia.   Due in 
large part to the progress he has made, we are now able to shift that effort 
to an individual in the region until a new hire is on board in Singapore.  

Jan will continue to spend approximately half of his time on EBS government 
affairs issues in Europe.  The remainder of his time, which previously was 
spent on Asia, now will be spent on European energy markets.  

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Sue

Earlier this week, the House passed S. 1937 which authorizes BPA to sell 
wholesale electric power to joint operating entities whose members were BPA 
customers as of January 1, 1999.  Those groups would then be barred from 
re-selling the power.  The bill is now headed to the White House for the 
President's signature.  A copy of the engrossed bill passed by both the House 
and Senate is attached.  Please feel free to contact us should you have any 
questions.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For Immediate Release:

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) released its 2001
Summer Assessment today.  "The assessment concludes that California will
experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this
summer," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, "and California
electricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than
last summer or this winter."  The report also states that extreme
drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the
available output of hydroelectric resources.  "We expect that utilities
in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands
this summer," he added, "but they will not have electricity available to
export to California and elsewhere."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the 2001
Summer Assessment is shown below. In addition, this press release as
well as the subject reports are available from the NERC web site
www.nerc.com.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Sincerely,

Julie Morgan

NERC Releases its 2001 Summer Reliability Assessment

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) released its 2001
Summer Assessment today.  "The assessment concludes that California will
experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this
summer," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, "and California
electricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than
last summer or this winter."  The report also states that extreme
drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the
available output of hydroelectric resources.  "We expect that utilities
in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands
this summer," he added, "but they will not have electricity available to
export to California and elsewhere."

In addition, the report cautions that New England, New York City, and
Texas should be closely watched, despite having adequate resources to
meet demand.  New England and New York City are particularly sensitive
to long-term heat waves and higher-than-expected generating unit forced
outages.  Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when
it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area
operations into one.  The report concludes that generating capacity
resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in
other areas of North America this summer.

 The assessment also points to concerns regarding north-to-south
transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United
States, particularly east of the Mississippi River.  The ability to
transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern
Interconnection was severely tested last summer, spurred by cool
temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south, as well as
high fuel prices in the south.  Early indications are that key
transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south
are already fully subscribed going into this summer, and that
transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout
the summer.

 As a supplement to its 2001 Summer Assessment report, NERC also
published a 2001 Summer Special Assessment.  This document is an
in-depth, independent examination of the expected summer conditions in
both California and the Pacific Northwest, and is based on interviews
with experts from both the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) and the Northwest Power Pool (NWPP).

 NERC's CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of
both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) ? the
CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this
summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand (rotating
blackouts) are expected.  NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater
than those expected by the CAISO.  NERC anticipates that firm demand may
be curtailed for about 260 hours over the course of this summer, with an
average firm demand curtailment of about 2,150 MW.

 NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to
serve all their firm electricity demands this summer.  However, NWPP
will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it
traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy
output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst
water years on record.

The independent reports, prepared by NERC's Reliability Assessment
Subcommittee, assess the projected demand and the resources available to
meet that demand this summer, as well as transmission reliability
issues.  The reports are posted on NERC's web site at www.nerc.com.  The
web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into
NAERO, and the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery
programs and activities.

*********************
NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

Subject: Arizona Public Service v. FERC


I think that you should intervene and possibly take an active role for a 
number of reasons.  Only if Enron were to win outright in the S.Ct. would 
petitioners' challenge in Arizona become moot.  But as we have always 
cautioned, the likelihood of overturning FERC and getting an S. Ct. decision 
putting all transmission on the OATT remains a long shot.  It is more likely 
that FERC will be affirmed and the DC Circuit's deference to FERC will remain 
as to what it must be unbundled.  In that scenario, it will be important to 
Enron that the Arizona precedent be upheld against challenge.  Specifically, 
that precedent is that once retail choice is implemented, all transmission 
becomes unbundled and subject to the OATT, even if later bundled in a default 
standard offer.   Absent legislation, this precedent and the lackadaisical  
RTOs are the only apparent vehicles for expanding open-access in the near 
term.

For these reasons, Enron should intervene at minimal cost and monitor how 
well FERC defends itself.  If FERC does a good job, that will be the end of 
its.  However, if FERC does a poor job, Enron should then consider filing a 
supporting brief.

		 Subject: Rate design for 3 cent Rate increase for PGE/SCE

2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+% 
of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
In a vindictive outlash, Lynch decision requires federal facilities to pay 
market prices under new schedules to be developed by the utilities
Judge's decision seems to require surcharge to show up as a separate line 
item; Lynch's decision requires that it not be shown separately

Oral argument occurs Friday and final decision is expected to be voted out 
Monday, June 14.

Below is a list of companies that compose the Fuel Cells Advocate group.  It 
is an ad hoc group that meets on a bi-monthly basis to pursue legislative 
proposals that will further the commercialization of the technology.  The 
$1000 per kilowatt tax credit is only one avenue they are pursuing.  
Membership in the group allows you to participate in the formulating of 
policy and policy papers.  There is NO cost to join, but they occasionally 
ask for contributions for printing materials.  The y are very interested in 
having Enron lend its name and active participation.

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition 
market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the "voluntary" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's "significant progress" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on "perception," not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are "ill-formed."  Southern concludes that the "Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge 
stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first.

(2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO 
filing in abeyance:

Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day 
period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and 
additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will 
provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the 
conclusion of the this period.  

(3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order 
request that it can be an RTO

States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about 
spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate 
transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.)

(4)  GridSouth response to protests

It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership 
structure of the LLC
GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the 
West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined 
Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing 
Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission 
system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking 
by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an 
OATT?)
Grid South will file interconnection procedures by 2/01.

As part of its implementation of the National Energy Policy (NEP) issued last 
week, the Administration today published two two executive orders in the 
Federal Register.  The first order, No. 13211, requires that agencies prepare 
a Statement of Energy Effects when an agency undertakes actions that are 
likely to have a significant effect upon the supply, transmission, or use of 
energy. The Statement of Energy Effects is designed  to provide useful energy 
related information and allow for better decision-making.  The second order, 
No.13212, encourages agencies to expedite their review and approval of new 
energy projects.

A couple of months ago, we formed a new group within EPSA called the 
Regulatory Affairs, Washington Staff, group (the name needs some help).  We 
discussed many things the group can do to increase our EPSA presence at FERC, 
including establishing monthly lunches featuring a different FERC 
guest/speaker per lunch.

Yesterday, Donna and I attended the first lunch of the group, sponsored by 
Mirant (Enron will be sponsoring the July lunch).  The FERC guest speaker was 
Don Gelinas.  (We believe Don had a big part in the Entergy Source & Sink 
order, so he is an important person to know.)  There were about 12 people at 
the lunch, which was a good number because it gave us all a chance to speak 
with Don and get to know him a little better.  The group was relaxed and 
festive, and I think this put Don at ease as well.

Don made a few remarks at the end of the lunch.  He said the Commission's 
main focus (other than California) was on the RTOs and getting them up and 
running by the end of the year.  He said FERC's main concerns are on:  
1)independence, 2) appropriate incentives, and 3) appropriate scope.  

Don acknowledged that having sufficient scope is a problem with a voluntary 
program, but he believes the Commission, under Hebert's leadership, will be 
able to gradually expand the scope of the RTOs so that ultimately there are 
only a handful of RTOs in the country.  Furthermore, Don said there are 
certain issues he believes must be included in RTO filings, including putting 
native load under the RTO tariff.   However, he says that phase-in may be 
necessary, and the trick will be in finding a reasonable phase-in period.

Other issues that Don said may require actual FERC decisions (FERC calling 
balls and strikes) will be on issues such as ATC, CBM and curtailment.  Don 
said ATC should be calculated the same way by all RTOs and that the question 
of retaining CBM must be decided by FERC.  

Based on these comments, these three areas may be places where we could get 
some FERC support for our views.  We should keep this in mind as we comment 
on future RTO filings.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah and Donna

SBX2 39 (Speier) and ABX2 28 (Migden) were pulled from their respective
committee hearings next week.  Both bills are being reviewed by the
Administration.  One item which the Administration is apparently
considering is making the new PPA a quasi-regulatory agency, perhaps
with authority over all in-state generation.  If the Administration
proceeds with this plan, it would probably be incorporated into one or
both of these bills.  In their current forms, SBX2 39 and ABX2 28 would
do the following:

SBX2 39 would dramatically increase the states regulatory authority over
in-state electric generation
facilities.  This measure is being opposed by IEP and several of its
member companies.

ABX2 28 would expand the authority of the EOB to allow EOB to act on any
matters made subject to the approval or determination by EOB, and to
investigate any matter to ensure that the interests of California's
citizens.  IEP and several of its member companies are supporting this
measure.

ABX2 35 (Vargas) was just amended to require the State Public Works
Board to acquire, for a period of at least 18 months but not to exceed
24 months, in the name of and on behalf of the state, pursuant to Part
11 (commencing with Section 15850) of Division 3 of the Government Code,
possession and use of real property necessary for the generation of
power.  The intent of the author is for the state to seize all divested
plants and "rent" them for approximately two years.  The bill will be
heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee next week.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility

Aneel announced a major changes in the MAE, wholesale energy market, this 
afternoon.  New resolutions will be published on Monday.  We expect that the 
adjustments will address market governance through independent professionals, 
establishment of clear guarantees and penalties, as well as clear rules in 
the case of non compliance.  Enron has been a driving force in bringing this 
situation to  front and center.  
We will update as we receive more information.

Ginger is kind enough to find us a slot this Monday (tentatively in the 
morning, but could slip to the afternoon...either is fine with me).  May I 
take the liberty to suggest the following agenda items:

Briefing on India Regulatory Needs (scope, time, and HR needed).
The current visit of Wade Cline to Houston this coming week.
KLey/JSkilling visit to India in the week of July 8th.

I also hope that there will be time to brief you of GA accomplishments and 
make the output available for its possible use in the PRC process.


Best regards

Rick:

I hope that all is well. Believe me, I am not trying to interfere with your 
vacation, but here is a quick update of what I have learnt over the weekend.

Ken Ley had a meeting with the Indian Finance Minister in New York over this 
weekend.  No specific news of the outcome, but they believe here that our 
message was "we want out, facilitate it, or we shall go out very noisily".  
Ken Ley, and possibly Jeff, are expected here in India in the week of July 
8th.  No confirmation as of yet.  Perhaps you would like to consider that you 
and I are to be here too.  
I expect to have a meeting with Wade either tomorrow (Tuesday), or after to 
discuss the suggested plan (outlined below, and based on if renegotiation, 
then semi permanent support, if exiting, then a week every 4 to 6 weeks).  

Of course, I look forward for your advise, comments and suggestions.

I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.

The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining 
the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  
I look forward for your comments and advise.

Best regards

AI

Here are the salient features:
Meeting with Wade:
The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs 
to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and 
agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support 
from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what 
needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an 
effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) 
just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be "penny wise 
and pound foolish" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that 
Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is 
complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. 
GA Needs in India:
The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five 
areas: 
a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), 
b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, 
c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), 
e)  Government of India, and 
f)  EBS.  
The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following 
scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) 
Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of 
yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:

        Arbitration  Renegotiation
Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high
Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high
Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high
Government of India, and      high   high
EBS.         medium  medium

It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC 
seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the 
sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the 
best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any 
degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a 
risk-averse person shall take the "undetermined scenario" as equal to 
"renegotiation", while a risk-taker shall take the "undetermined"" as equal 
to arbitration.  

Personal:
It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in 
the "renegotiation" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a 
visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working 
under legal/commercial.  

Suggested Approach:
Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for 
the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the 
suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is "if there is 
renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full 
time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis".  

Caveat:
It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the 
suggested approach above one way or another.

		 Subject: India - Progress Report One

Rick: 
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and 
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting 
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from 
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing 
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support".  
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give 
Houston the final say.   

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA 
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and 
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, 
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit 
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams 
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation 
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the 
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is 
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market 
basis, but rather on accounting basis.  
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely 
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added 
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated 
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to 
complete phase II which we are refusing).  
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy 
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW 
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such 
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks 
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every 
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and 
solved.  
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest 
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them 
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned 
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the 
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the 
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the 
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment 
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the 
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of 
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there 
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for 
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to 
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you 
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
"mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Florida Study Recommends Wholesale Deregulation

problems such as those in California. Florida's Energy 2020 Study Commissio=

unanimously recommended that the Florida Legislature consider deregulating=

plants in the state.=20

Analysis: Florida Gov. Jeb Bush created the Energy 2020 Study Commission wi=

the intent of submitting an initial deregulation proposal for consideration=
=20
in this spring's legislative session. Florida's energy market represents a=
=20
$13 billion industry, so obviously there has been great interest on the par=
t=20
of new energy suppliers that want to begin serving the state. =20

Florida continues to move slowly toward deregulation across all levels.=20
Competition on the retail side may take several more years, especially as t=

to=20
removing state regulations. The commission's recommendation to initiate=20
deregulation on the wholesale side is considered a small step toward reachi=
ng=20
the ultimate goal of total deregulation in the state. =20

Specifically, the commission has endorsed a plan that would allow=20
out-of-state companies to build new merchant power plants in Florida and se=
ll=20
wholesale electricity to the state's utilities. Florida law forbids=20
out-of-state electric utility companies from providing year-round service t=
o=20
utilities and customers, but merchant plants can provide backup service to=
=20
existing utilities when energy reserves are stretched thin, to avoid power=
=20
outages and rolling brownouts. Also under the commission's plan, in-state=
=20
utilities would also be allowed to sell their regulated plants at depreciat=
ed=20
values to affiliated companies that would compete head-to-head on the=20
wholesale market. In addition, the state's utilities could engage in=20
long-term power contracts with suppliers instead of relying on the open=20
market (a major difference from California's original plan), and state=20
regulators would still review all wholesale contract prices. The commission=
's=20
plan must still be approved by the Florida Legislature, and the commission=
=20
readily admits that approval may not be easily obtained due to the ongoing=
=20
crisis in California.=20

At the present time, no official start date for electric competition in=20
Florida has been announced. The state's "go slow" approach is characteristi=
c=20
of other Southeastern U.S. states, many of which continue to enjoy=20
comparatively low electric rates. Florida's renewed interest in deregulatio=
n=20
is being driven by the belief among several commission members and other=20
officials that competition eventually will result in lower rates for=20
consumers. Or, at the very least, competition should prevent rates from=20
continuing to increase as they reportedly would under a regulated structure=
.=20
The commission's plan also is intended to prevent power supply problems in=
=20
Florida similar to those in California, by allowing for new generation to b=
e=20
built in the state by external companies. Florida law requires power=20
companies to hold 20 percent of their power supplies in reserve to that the=
y=20
can handle periods of extreme usage. However, both the commission's chair a=
nd=20
Gov. Bush have suggested that Florida will face a shortage of electricity i=
n=20
the next decade unless out-of-state companies build new plants. =20

Consumer groups and municipal electric providers have resisted the=20
commission's recommendation. In general, such groups fear that deregulating=
=20
Florida's wholesale market would lead to higher electricity bills since big=
=20
utilities in the state would be allowed to earn higher profits that may or=
=20
may not result in benefits for consumers. In fact, the Florida Municipal=20
Electric Association recently argued that annual electricity prices in=20
Florida would rise by between $700 million and $1.6 billion if the=20
commission's plan to initiate wholesale deregulation is approved. In=20
addition, Florida's utilities have been rather effective in persuading stat=
e=20
officials to move slowly toward deregulation, perhaps out of concern about=
=20
losing their monopoly status. Walter Revell, the chairman of the Energy 202=
0=20
Study Commission, denied that the group is considering any plan that would =
be=20
partial to the state's largest investor-owned utilities, which include=20
Florida Power & Light, Tampa Electric, Florida Power Corp. and Gulf Power. =
=20

The commission's recommendation supports what is already a fast-growing=20
wholesale business in the state of Florida, with outside power companies su=
ch=20
as Duke, Enron, Calpine Corp. and others aggressively trying to penetrate t=
he=20
state and gain a foothold for when deregulation emerges in full force. Such=
=20
power suppliers may be accurately surmising that Florida is headed toward a=
=20
supply / demand imbalance, as has occurred in California. An imbalance of=
=20
this sort would offer competitive opportunities for power suppliers in the=
=20
state. According to a report in the St. Petersburg Times, merchant power=20
companies have announced plans to build some 20 plants across Florida just=
=20
over the last year or so. However, the article stated that the Florida's bi=
g=20
utility companies still have enough clout to block any plant proposal.=20

For instance, Florida Power, Florida Power & Light and Tampa Electric joine=
d=20
forces last year to block Duke Energy from constructing a plant near Dayton=
a=20
Beach. Yet, Duke pushes forward and recently said that it would revive plan=

to build a merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. Duke's plans to build t=

plant had previously been blocked by a Florida Supreme Court ruling that su=
ch=20
plants were prohibited under state law.=20

Enron unveiled plans for two "peaker" plants in Pompano and Deerfield Beach=
,=20
Fla., several weeks ago. Construction on both sites is pending city and sta=
te=20
environmental department approval, but Enron hopes to have both 500 MW=20

Calpine received approval to build a 529-MW natural gas-fired plant to supp=

electricity to Seminole Electric Cooperative. The plant will be part of the=

Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy

UPDATE FROM EBS OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

Since its inception just two years ago, Enron Broadband Services has made=
=20
significant progress toward achieving our ambitious goals of being the=20
leading=20
provider of premium broadband content and the largest buyer and seller of=
=20
bandwidth on a global basis.  We are extremely proud of the company=01,s=20
accomplishments and equally optimistic about the future of EBS.

The market for bandwidth intermediation and risk management is developing=
=20
more quickly than anticipated =01) faster than the markets for natural gas =
or=20
even=20
electricity had developed.  Global Trading and Risk Management has already=
=20
executed more than 600 transactions this year, far exceeding the 321 total=
=20
transactions executed in 2000. The Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), with
its first-of-a-kind pooling point infrastructure, is in place to provide th=
e=20
physical=20
backbone and switching platform to support EBS=01, emerging bandwidth and=
=20
related trading operations.

Likewise, EBS has developed a superior technical and commercial platform to=
=20
digitally deliver entertainment on-demand.  While we have terminated our=20
relationship with Blockbuster because of their inability to secure content,=
=20
we=20
remain confident that EBS will be successful in independently acquiring=20
content=20
commitments and developing distribution partnerships for this exciting new=
=20
business.

EBS will continue to evolve as we build upon our presence in the bandwidth =
and
network services market.  While the market for broadband services in the U.=
S.=20
and globally has undergone significant change in recent months, the demand=
=20
for=20
broadband services continues to grow dramatically and EBS has the skills an=
d=20
strategy required to be successful long term.

To better focus our efforts and respond to the market, we have made some=20
organizational changes to enable us to effectively execute our strategy and=
=20
efficiently grow EBS.  These changes are outlined below and a current=20
organizational chart is attached.

David Cox, formerly Managing Director of Content Origination, has been name=
d=20
Chief Commercial Officer, reporting to the EBS office of the chair.  This n=
ew=20

will enable David to share his broad origination expertise with the various=
=20

Digital Content Services, formerly Content Origination, is now led by Frank=

Bay=20
with Rich DiMichele and Ed Smida.  Rich will focus on the development of th=
e=20
content risk management business.

Stewart Seeligson is now leading an expanded Wholesale Origination unit=20
combining=20
media transport opportunities that Stewart has been developing in the=20

l=20
carriers,=20
ISPs, and network service providers.  This new origination team will focus =
on=20
executing highly structured transactions with significant value in the=20
wholesale market.

John Echols now leads the Enterprise Origination unit with Jim Crowder, Mat=
t=20
Harris,=20
and Brad Nebergall.  Bryan Burnett also has joined the Enterprise team from=
=20
Enron=20

opportunities with technology, financial, and corporate customers.

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES
Please welcome the following new employees to EBS:

Starcom voices interest, though industry remains skeptical=20
Enron Media Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with=
=20
its plans to=20
create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space.

In a recent letter to Starcom's clients, CEO Renetta McCann said the=20
Chicago-based media=20
company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal.

"Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry, we=
=20
find Enron's plan=20
intriguing," McCann wrote. "Clearly, Enron proposes breaking the rules of h=
ow=20
media can be=20
bought and sold."

Last year, Enron Corp., the $30 billion financial risk management company=
=20
previously associated=20
with the energy industry, created EMS to market "price-risk management" pla=
ns=20
to advertisers=20
and media-service companies. In addition, Houston-based Enron seeks to=20
execute $1 billion in media=20
buys by year's end, though a representative declined to release information=
=20
about any possible deals.

In this volatile economy, marketers and media agencies could use Enron's=20
ability to hedge the risk=20
of media costs as far as five years ahead, said Edward Ondarza, a vp for EM=
S.=20

Up to this point, the only way marketers could cushion risk is by "buying=
=20
forward" via the upfront,=20
he added. "We want to create a year-round upfront by developing a media=20
exchange [between=20
advertisers, media agencies and networks]," he said.

Despite Enron's pitch, Starcom has received little feedback to the letter=
=20
from its clients, said Kevin=20
Gallagher, vp and director of local investments for Starcom, which claims=
=20
$4.3 billion in billings=20
and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft. "We're always open to new=
=20
ways of doing=20
business, and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of what's going on," h=
e=20
said. "But we are=20
not engaged in any business with Enron. It was and remains merely=20
exploratory."

Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enron's business model, because =
of=20
possible legal issues=20
and the novelty of the concept. But they acknowledge that eventually Enron'=
s=20
approach will become=20
commonplace.

"In theory it's great, but the practice is more difficult," said Jon Mandel=
,=20
MediaCom chief negotiating=20
officer. "There are some big issues that need to be worked out."

In the first quarter, Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the=
=20
amount of bandwidth than it had in=20
the previous quarter, the unit of energy giant Enron Corp. announced=20
Tuesday. =20

The subsidiary showed a loss of $35-million in the quarter on revenues of=
=20
$83-million, the results being=20
attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points.

President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed 580=20
transactions in the quarter, more than=20
double the level of the previous quarter. More impressive was the seven-fol=
d=20
increase in transacted bandwidth=20
this quarter: 43,400 Terabytes versus 6,005 Terabytes in the fourth quarter=
. =20
Enron is =01&making excellent=20
progress in creating a commodity market,=018 Skilling said. =20

Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter, for a total of=
=20
120.  Of that number 70%=20
of the customers are carriers or network service providers, a spokeswoman=
=20
told BMR, adding that half of=20
the deals done in the quarter were with that group.



Bandwidth intermediation/trading was the other key driver, with 580=20
transactions posted during the=20
quarter, a significant ramp-up from 232 reported 4Q:00 and 320 for all of=
=20
2000. In our view, we are=20
way past the question =01&Can bandwidth be commoditized?=018 and are enteri=
ng the=20
period of rapid=20
growth in commodity volumes which precedes the all-important emergence of=
=20
profitability.  In the=20
energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas and power in both the=20
United States and=20
Europe, the commodity volume growth phase lasted 1-3 years before=20
profitability emerged. We=20
see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market, which from a commodity=20
perspective =01&looks,=20
acts and feels=018 like electricity and natural gas, to perform any differe=
ntly=20
from these commodities.=20
We are entering Year 2 of the period of rapid volume growth. The next=20

be for Enron to announce a reasonably =01&date certain=018 for profitabilit=
y, much=20
in the same manner=20
as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago. We think that date=

could be late 2002=20
or early 2003.

Excerpts:

...Enron's vice president and broadband trader, Paul Racicot, says Enron=20

=20
than that in the entire market.=20
And while liquidity on such major routes as Los Angeles/New York and New=20

substantially, 2001 will likely be remembered as the year progress was made=

on issues whose resolution=20
was critical to the long-term health of the market.

...Probably the best-known proposal to promote network connectivity in the=

Andy, I need to determine where our outreach for ACCF stands.  At present, 
Jeff Skilling is slated to attend an ACCF dinner on September 11.  They are 
obviously bugging me about the dinner arrangements AND our fund-raising 
outreach.  I probably need to cancel Jeff's appearance if we are not going to 
do their solicitation.  Thanks.

 The point I didn't get a chance to finish this morning was that Sithe (the 
proponent of a major project- though many are skeptical ) have evidently told 
the Ministry of Energy that they are comfortable with a Spring 2002 opening.  
This is not helpful because generation investment has been key to the gov't's 
message re the benefits of competition.   The Minister has been using the 
alleged Sithe position to counter the argument that a Fall opening is 
critical to sustaining momentum and investment in the Ontario power 
sector.    I know the Sithe person here and he is very ornery (the former 
Chair of IPPSO) . I know that we have a major commercial arrangement with 
Sithe in the US.   Is there any one in Houston (Lay, Lavorato, Delainey) who 
can lever a more supportive position out of Sithe.                     With 
respect to the last point in my attached memo, I am wondering whether we 
could lever some senior US official to draw attention to the enormous profits 
that BC Hydro made in California and use this to make a case for reciprocity  
- "If you want access to our markets, you better open up Yours as soon as 
possible".  (Best do this in advance of Lay's meeting with the Premier).   I 
think the point is more obviously made re BC than OPG but  the point would 
not be lost on OPG which had revenues in excess of CAD $279,000,000 in 2000  
on 4.0TWh.   Most, if not all of that, of that would be from US markets.   In 
the absence of a FERC marketer authorization, all OPG physical transactions 
are done at the border.   In NY, even those border transactions require OPG 
to be a member of the NY ISO.  In order to become a member of the NY ISO, OPG 
had to get a waiver of the tariif provision re reciprocity.  They got  an 
extension of that waiver from the Management Committee  earlier this year 
only after a speech by Dave Goulding of the IMO to the Members Committee that 
the Ontario market would open this year.   That waiver will expire at the end 
of this year.   So OPG must understand that there is a serious risk that the 
waiver will not be extended if the market is not opened in accordance with 
Goulding's assurances.

Attached, please find a mocked up version of SBX2 27 (Bowen), regarding
direct access, as it is proposed to be amended in the Senate
Appropriations Committee today. A new element to this bill would require
ESPs to pay a reinstatement fee to DWR if they return customers to an
IOU.

Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

We now have confirmed the following meetings for Lay and Lavorato: a) Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert at 2:15 pm  ( Minister's Boardroom is booked  so location 
yet to be determined, but likely in Macdonald Block)  and b) Premier Harris  
and staff at 3:45 pm ( Premier's Office, 6th Floor, Whitney Block).   
Macdonald and Whitney Blocks about a two minute walk apart.   We will likely 
be out of the Premier's Office by 4:30 pm.  As I mentioned in an earlier 
e-mail, the only other meeting I would suggest, if you think there is time,  
would be with Floyd Laughren, chair of the OEB.   Our collective opinion of 
Laughren may not be high but he is obviously a key player in the  ultimate 
decision to move forward.  Let me know whether you want me to try to arrange 
that meeting or whether you think the other two meetings are sufficient.

FYI. Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be 
quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having 
this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group 
of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is 
the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.  Will 
check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes 
were made.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:

One new projects have been added tot he list of hot deals for June 1st.  
They--and their suggested action times--are as follows:

  Project  Originator  Description   
EWS
  Midway   Dave Duran  Investment in Peaking capacity in Florida ($277 
million).
Suggested Action Item: Communicate with SMontovano, and Marchris findings, 
and compile GA comments for RAC if any.  It is not clear at this stage 
whether this project shall replace Ft. Pierce which also aims at acquiring 
peaking capacity in Florida (same originator).  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a "native load" preference).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering ?lets say ?$1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external ?load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will ? ?be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? c)
Remember also that the scope for ?economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff ?($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately ?$4 ?MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh), ?plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost). ?Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.) ?Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners. ?(In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE. ?Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck: ?Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. ?One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
 
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south. ?As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power. ?However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated. ?If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below). ?Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance. ?Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
 
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market. ?Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening. ?Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
 
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
 
Thanks,
 
Dave

David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are
correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic
export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the
economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative
generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling
tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including
exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion
costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the
connected market is congested. ?Everything else being equal, this means
that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in
the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be
conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said
that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover,
we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are
moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the
decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices) ?and extensive new
generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year
increase in ?available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is
about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability. ? Again, my
colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at
any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail. ?Give
me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points. ? 416 865
3707. ?Regards, Aleck

Thanks for the report. ?It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that
there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another
California.
 
The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that
energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by
imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on
higher-priced imports to meet demand. ? The first two points seem to
contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US
markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time,
putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market. ?If prices are
higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to
export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the
Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are
determined on the margin. ?Price volatility and extreme price swings were
also identified as concerns by MEUs.
 
Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any
comments you can share?

		 Subject: FYI:  TWO PRESS RELEASES TODAY FROM GOVERNOR DAVIS...


FYI, more of the same from the Governor's office.  Also, I have received a
couple of calls about whether it is true that Senator Dunn rescheduled the
generator hearing this week that had previously been cancelled.  The rumor
is true, but it is my understanding that the discussion has been occurring
directly between Dunn's office and individual lawyers for involved
generators, so I can't really add anything substantive to the mix.

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01:308
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/27/2001 
GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY HISTORY 
Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since '88 
KERN COUNTY 
With the flick of a switch, Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in
California's energy history by ceremoniously switching on the 320 megawatt
Sunrise Power Project in Kern County. Sunrise is the first major power plant
to come on line in California since 1988. 
"We are taking control of our energy destiny," Governor Davis said. "This is
the first major power plant built in California since 1988. It's clean,
efficient and it was built in record time."
The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and
Texaco Power and Gasification. Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the
power generated at the Sunrise plant to California's Department of Water
Resources under a long-term contract at a reasonable rate. By the summer of
2003, the plant is expected to produce 585 megawatts.
"We're building more new power plants than at any other time in our
history," Governor Davis said. "Next week, I will be cutting the ribbon on
the 500 megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City. It will be the largest
gas-fired power plant built in California in a generation. Over the next two
weeks, we'll be bringing a combined total of more than 1,300 MW on line -
enough to power the entire city of San Jose." 
In the 12 years before Governor Davis took office, not a single major power
plant was licensed in California. Under Governor Davis' leadership,
California has licensed 16 major power plants and 10 "peaker" plants.
Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer. 
The combination of these new power plants, with additional renewables,
distributed generation, and re-rates of existing power plants, will bring
more than 4,000 new megawatts online by the end of September. At no other
time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under
construction and in the pipeline.
Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December 7, 2000, making
it operational in a record 6 and a half months. The construction force
worked 18 hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days
ahead of schedule. Because the plant was completed before July 1, it is
eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under
the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). 
"None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison
Mission Energy, Texaco, and a dedicated construction force," Governor Davis
said. "I would like to commend Black and Veatch, ARB and the State Building
and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this
project on line ahead of schedule. If not for your Herculean efforts, we
would not be here today."

Rick:

With respect to CN:   They were eager to meet with us to talk about a JV, and 
joint advocacy of competitive issues in the regulatory arena.    We exchanged 
information (white paper, rate design theories, etc).   I talked to CN's 
attorney last week, and he said that their management had been slow in 
getting back to him on this (even though they were pushing the idea 
initially).   He speculated that they were waiting to see the STB's new 
merger rules before getting together with us.   In any event, he said he 
would get back to me on this.

I left word with Dan on this last week.

Let me know  if you have any questions.

Lisa

The NYPSC today issued an Order directing the expedited consideration of  
"bottoms-up" rate unbundling by all of the state's major electric and gas 
utilities. Enron has long pushed the PSC to address this issue. The PSC wants 
unbundled rates in effect by the first half of 2002, and has set up a 
two-stage process to get there. Under the first stage, which the PSC wants 
completed and brought to them for decision by this August, major policy 
issues of statewide import  are to be considered. Resolution of these issues 
will guide the actual embedded cost studies which each of the utilities are 
directed to perform. These cost studies and the fully unbundled rates that 
will flow from them, will then be reviewed in utility-specific cases. The PSC 
expects the studies to be completed before the end of this year.  I 
anticipate that we will actively participate in this proceeding, which is 
actually being spun off from the "end-state" proceeding, through our NESPA 
coalition. A copy of the PSC's order should be available on their website:  
www.dps.state.ny.us

Philip

Attached the relevant sections of a paper produced by EFET (largely by us) on 
TPA in the French gas market and Enron comments to the EU on TPA issues. Note 
that these papers were produced in December of 2000 and mid-Feb 2001 
respectively. Notable changes since then include.

A relatively competitively priced conversion service (H-Cal to L-Cal gas) at 
TaiseniSres has been but in place 
The balancing regime has been improved and penalties are now indexed to 
Zeebrugge (x 1.5 or x -0.5)
Access conditions to LNG have been published
Flexibility services are offered by GdF- Supply. The terms and conditions up 
to now had been onerous. Recent talks between Didier and a customer suggest 
that they have been wildly improved but this still needs to analysed by us.
Transit tariffs have been published but is also restricted to a  year-long. 
The regulator is seriously considering changing the tariff structure from a 
distance related structure to a entry/exit type structure.
The first hearing on the law (directive transposition) at the parliament has 
been delayed from spring 2001 to summer 2002. Regulated tariffs will not 
likely be put in place until 2003.

Let me know if you need more information.

Some things to consider --

A. Enron Response to Alliance Compliance Filing (pre-MISO/ARTO discussions)

1. Stakeholder Process
 a. Getting better, more meetings post EPSA letter
2. Day One Congestion Management (not much to discuss, already approved by 
FERC)
3. Key Issue - Many details left uncertain until ARTO filing 120 days prior 
to 12/15/01

RECOMMENDATION - Don't file right now.  Talk with FERC staff about our Wish 
List for RTOs. Work through RTO process to implement.

B. National Grid Operation of ARTO (Comments June 14/01)

1. Should Enron Oppose NG?

Yes a. Unclear about how much control NG has in the process (complete tariff 
control?).
 b. There are issues about NG independence from market (NE and NY assets).

No a. NG wants to be a Transco in the ultimate state.
 b. This is a mid-term solution that could work.
 c. If done right, better opportunity to deal with transmission issues than 
current structure.

RECOMMENDATION - Enron should file comments on key open policy issues with 
for-profit Gridco model.  

We don't oppose, but we are concerned that controls must be in place to 
ensure well functioning markets.
The Transco model is the best model for transmission operation.  If this 
action by NG leads ultimately to a Transco, it is a good outcome.
The operator of RTO tariff must be independent of all market players (NG owns 
generation and has distribution in New England).  Transelect wrote "I believe 
quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a 
significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast 
(New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small step from this 
decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that 
would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating 
the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National policy, transmission operators 
should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets.  As 
a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of 
transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to 
protect above market native generation.  How would you like to try shipping 
power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a 
significant generator, controlling access to the market?"  We  should make 
this argument very strongly.  NG must have a plan to divest itself of the 
generation and distribution side of the business because NE and NY are 
economically viable markets impacted by the Alliance RTO.
The Operator of RTO must have full authority to modify the tariff and 
operations of the RTO.  The Transmission Providers should not be able to 
restrict or limit in any fashion the for-profit Gridco Operator beyond 
ensuring (1) technical proficency, (2) assets returned in reasonable manner, 
and (3) recovery of FERC approved revenue requirement.

Here's what John found.  We will follow up with DeFazio.  He is extremely 
liberal.   His credibility is highly linked to his highly liberal 
positions.   Most pundits will see this for what it is, given the source.  
But we will see him soon.

The ERCOT Board met yesterday in Austin to discuss among other things the 
implementation of the Texas Choice Pilot and the single control area under 
the control of the ERCOT ISO.  Below are the primary items of interest.

1.   ERCOT proposed the following plan to implement the Pilot program and the 
wholesale:

May 25, 2001

ERCOT begins to transfer security analysis to the ESCA system
Participants able to start viewing network conditions, preliminary load 
forecasts, preliminary A/S market requirement analysis, and retail load 
profiles
ERCOT begins to manage and publish participant information and process 
customer service requests

June 1, 2001

ERCOT initiates switch processing from competitive retailers starting with 
small volumes and to be completed by July 1, 2001 (this is only the switch 
request, power does not "flow" from the REP until the billing cycle after 
July 6, 2001).
ERCOT begins to process retail meter read information.
Participants begin to enter outages in ERCOT systems (this will be parallel 
to current outage system entry).
ERCOT will begin to publish distribution and transmission loss factors to the 
market.

June 8, 2001

ERCOT Begins to complete data aggregation functions and initiates UFE 
calculations/analysis.
ERCOT's A/S market requirements and QSE obligation Calculations are ready for 
sing control area operations
ERCOT begins to execute the production settlement algorithms.  The settlement 
results are not binding.
ERCOT begins to transfer grid security decisions to the new systems
Data aggregation allows initial calculations of UFE to be made visible to the 
market providing energy accounting information

July 6, 2001

Frequency Control.  ERCOT begins single control area operation and 
controlling frequency.  The existing control area replaced with the single 
control area run by ERCOT.
Wholesale Markets.  ERCOT administers the regulation, balancing energy, and 
reserve markets.  ERCOT starts clearing prices as part of single control area 
operations.  The wholesale competitive market, as defined by the protocols is 
initiated with ERCOT settling A/S markets centrally.
ERCOT begins to execute financial transfer processes as a result of binding 
settlement with participants
QSEs must have completed qualification activities


While the proposal satisfies many of the competing concerns of the 
Stakeholders and the PUCT, there are a few outstanding issues that remain.

ERCOT will begin switching load transfer requests on June 1 2001, but actual 
settlement and energy flow will not occur until after the wholesale market 
opens on July 6, 2001.  Enron has submitted a proposal that would allow the 
retail market to decouple from the wholesale market which would allow the 
wholesale market time to remedy the system limitations and the retail market 
could begin June 1, 2001.  Under the ERCOT timeline if the wholesale market 
is not ready by July 6, 2001 and the switch requests have already begun, then 
there is no method to serve a customer full requirements without the ability 
of the REP to purchase balancing energy and other A/S other than purchasing 
under current tariff.  I can provide a copy of the Enron proposal to those 
who are interested.

Another concern is for reliability of the system.  Some parties question the 
wisdom of opening the wholesale market in the middle of the summer peak, 
rather than waiting until the summer peak has passed.

  
2. Credit Standards.  The Board also voted on language for the surety bonds.  
There has been a debate as to whether ERCOT should allow security bonds in 
light of what has happened in California and the surety bond that was 
underwritten by AIG.  At this point, the PUCT order requires ERCOT to accept 
a surety bond, however, ERCOT is trying to tighten the payment language.  The 
language that the board approved will be forwarded when I get the correct 
language.  The board approved the addition of BBB- credit to the credit limit 
matrix.


3. New Power Company made an unsuccessful appeal for corporate membership.  
New Power argued that they were technically not an affiliate of EPMI who 
holds the Corporate Membership.  EES for example has associate member 
status.    It was pointed out by ERCOT that EPMI listed New Power as a 
corporate affiliate on their application for corporate membership.  Marianne 
Carroll, represented New Power in the appeal, and stated that EPMI did not 
ask her advice prior to listing New Power as affiliate.  An additional 
rationale cited by New Power was that in the future Reliant Energy wants to 
"spin off" their generation company and that when they do, they should be 
allowed a Corporate membership as well.  I am concerned about the appearance 
of the appeal by New Power, it looked like an attempt by Enron to sway the 
process in "their" favor by getting additional votes on ERCOT issues.

Louise --

I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Justice Department has launched 
an investigation into the online electronic bond trading site set up by 
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Chase, and others.   The Justice Department 
said that they are studying the "competitive issues that arise from such 
close cooperation among competitors."

I will monitor this very closely, as I'm sure it will have implications for 
the likes of ICE.

Hope you're doing well.

Lisa

Dominik,

It was good to speak with you at the EEMF Forum; we all found your 
presentation impressive and the responses to the questions finely tuned to 
leave us thinking that we had been given priviledged access to information 
when in fact we hadn't; what a pro!

As I said, my colleague Rick Shapiro (head of our global public affairs)  was 
impressed and he was serious when he thought of you for our Frankfurt 
office.  I am sure that if you showed interest, things could move quickly (or 
even slowly, if that's what you wanted) and any particular circumstances that 
you had would be taken into account.  I can certainly attest to the welcoming 
nature of Enron.  have a think about it, and if you want to folow up, on a 
completely informal and no commitment basis, let me know.  Even if you do not 
want to leave, it's good to know what your market worth is!!

Lunch some time? 

Brendam

Lisa - 

attached is an updated status report on training programs taken by EGA 
employees; I received a couple responses to the email we sent yesterday and 
have made note of those changes on this report

I got a couple of emails from people confirming that the Enron Law Conference 
counts toward the 3 course requirement; it's my understanding that attendance 
at the Law Conference would count but will need you and/or Rick to confirm; 
right now I've counted it

I'll keep you updated as I learn of new courses taken, etc.

Here's a great summary memo from our friends at Wolf, Block.   (One note, 
however.  The memo indicates that dark fiber is in some instances regulated 
by the states.  Further discussion revealed that this is true only in a 
limited number of instances in North Carolina).

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.


"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy."

Rick:
The internal design and testing of EES risk quantification and mitigation is 
now in a stage complete enough to be rolled in.  The process is cooperative 
in nature between URM (utility risk management), GA in Houston, and GA in the 
regions.  Harry, Stella, Pat, and I shall start communicating this process to 
the colleagues, each in his/her regions shortly.    

Please let me know if you have any comment and/or advise.  Furthermore, 
please advise if you want me to walk through the process with you to 
demonstrate its abilities and output.

Best regards

Here it is guys including the new text in blue. 

Stella Chan and Pat Keene are currently streamlining the process of providing 
Government and Regulatory support to URM (Utility Risk Management) to include:
Curve validation Process, 
Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, 
Coordination of Strategy Development, and 
Coordination of Strategy Implementation.  
A description of these functions are as follows:
Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating, 
every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's 
books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review 
period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA 
personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved.  
Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at quantifying 
dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory inputs on a 
specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in progress.  This 
process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel (also possibly by 
URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES positions.  The 
quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA.   
Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and 
quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely 
call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of 
Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in 
association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in 
Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma 
Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action 
items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for 
implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, 
and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if 
necessary.
Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it 
shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to 
coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the 
regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the 
implementation as needed.   

To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines 
of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall 
coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional 
wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:
 Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC, 
SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. 
 Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).


>From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the 
Regional Managers (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry 
shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to be 
as autonomous as possible and shall make the least possible demand on the 
time and work load of the regional managers (usually in the final sprint for 
approvals).  

Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the 
processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise.

In the current debate over how the U.S. should approach domestic and=20

Two articles (attached) appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend. =

Experience with Voluntary Approaches - Back to the Future?
The U.S. and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly=

credibility in the international debate. =20
Clearly, industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong=20
program, but as recent weeks suggest, Administration officials have differi=

views on objectives and approaches.    Below are some recent examples of wh=
y=20
voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results:
1) Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by former=20
President Bush and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate, developed=20
countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 19=
90=20
levels by the year 2000.  By 1995, industrialized countries acknowledged th=
at=20
they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal, and initiated negotiatio=

to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments.  These=

=20
reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20

2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=
p=20
a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc=
e=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim of the =01&1605b=018 program is to encou=
rage=20
voluntary emissions reductions.  While some companies participate in the=20
program, it has not yielded significant emissions reductions.  Companies=20
participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain=

experience with inventories, reporting and verification.  Many hope to be=
=20
rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator=
y=20
program.  To encourage participation, 1605b provides wide flexibility on=20
setting a baseline.  It also allows for dual reporting of emissions=20
reductions, self-certification of reductions and permits the entity to deci=

the level of reporting it undertakes.

A 1998 GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of=

Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on 
this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the "has issues" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.
Thanks, Paul

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20

Rick:

As agreed I have put down some thoughts summarizing how to proceed on these
issues (see attachment). I have kept the schedule as tight as possible given
the urgency in responding publicly. Let me know what you think.

I don't have everyone's email here (I am at home) so perhaps Ginger can
circulate it to Steve, Ron, etc. as appropriate.

By the way if you ever want to reach me you can try (617) 513-5904, which is
a cellphone that I generally have with me (but very rarely give out the
number).

Seabron --

I hear that you are coming to Houston to discuss market structure on

Rick,
 I called Michele Cisneros-Ruch per your request about Montana issues since 
Paul Kaufman is out of the office.  She was interested in the possibility of 
passage of a set of bills currently in the Montana Legislature dealing with 
1) Taxes on Excess Profits for Electric Sales, 2) Wholesale Transaction 
Taxes, 3) Regulation of Wholesale Prices. 

 I made contact with a friend who consults for PP&L Montana to learn the 
status of the bills.  The likelihood is that all the bills will pass and be 
sorted out in some kind of super conference committee to arrive at the final 
bill.  Montana Power and PP&L Montana are fighting the bills.    PP&L Montana 
maintaining that the attempt to regulate wholesale sales is illegal, since 
FERC has jurisdiction.  The legislature is not dissuaded by the arguments and 
will likely pass anyway and wind up going to Court.  One of the major issues 
is the expiration of Montana Power's contract for default retail service from 
PP&L Montana.  It expires on June 30, 2002, a few months before the next 
election.  They want someone to blame if prices rise (the Republicans that 
is) and the Democrats would be happy to blame the Republicans.  

 I conveyed this information to Michele by phone.

Steve

Hi, Rick:  It is only today that I have discovered you are my "direct boss" 
in the context of my performance review.  Since the Organizational chart 
reflects that I report to Joe Hillings and since I have not been invited to 
participate in any of your Direct Report Conference calls nor meetings, I had 
no clue until today of this change.  In fact, in the almost eleven years I 
have worked for Enron, Joe Hillings has always been my "direct boss" in the 
context of my performance reviews.

I give you this background only because I feel disadvantaged in not knowing 
this sooner.  Specifically, there is not a day that goes by when I do not 
report directly to Joe Hillings about what I am doing, copy him on memos, 
etc. whereas, I rarely, if ever, bother you with this daily reporting.  Since 
you are, in fact, my direct boss, it seems you should have been copied on all 
these memos, updates, etc. instead of or in addition to Joe Hillings plus it 
seems I should have been included in the Direct Report meetings and calls.

>From this day forward, I will copy you on everything I send to Joe Hillings.  
I assume I should continue to copy Joe on everything I send you plus now also 
add Linda Robertson?  When Linda Robertson comes on board, will I remain a 
direct report to you?  Should I now begin participating in your direct report 
regular phone calls and attend the Direct Report meetings?  Please advise.

Further, the Performance Review written policy was understood by me whereby I 
select my reviewers who must be a peer or higher, then discuss my selections 
with my boss and then together I am advised who my boss agrees will be 
reviewing me.   This time, apparently non-peers were selected to review me 
and I am unaware of the selections made for me (other than those who were 
selected who have told me about their selection.)  Rick, shouldn't just peers 
or higher rate me or has there been a policy change whereby everyone in the 
company is now having a 360 review?  Further, at least one of those selected 
to review me has not worked with me all year since our issue areas never 
intersected.  Shouldn't only those who have worked directly with me be in a 
position to review me?

Those employees whom I have worked with most closely this year who are a peer 
or higher include:  Joe Hartsoe, Tom Briggs, Joe Hillings, Dean Tarbet, Bill 
Votaw and Tom White.  I would hope you would ask these folks to conduct a 
review on my performance.

I welcome reporting to you.  I am just embarrassed to find out about this 
good news only today in that I've done little to "report" to you.  Joe 
Hillings can certainly testify to the fact he has received ample reporting 
from me.  Again, I will rectify this immediately.    Many thanks!  Cynthia

Jim, Rick and Steve:

This is for tomorrow morning's meeting. To give us a focus for the
discussions I thought it would be best if we went through this fairly
quickly (maybe 45-50 minutes) as a presentation first.

Given the complexity of a full market design, this is obviously only an
overview. But our first priority is to present the ideas and develop the
logic behind the proposals.

See you tomorrow.

Rick,

Fernando Alonso is the person from the Ministry of Energy that visited with 
us in Houston and whom we saw in his office in Mexico City.  Fernando as you 
know has been very supportive of all our initiatives and has been an ally 
since he took charge of his office.

He has referred Carlos Lara to me.  He asks that if possible we get him a job 
interview at Enron.  From what I can see, Carlos is a highly qualified 
professional.  Fernando strictly asked for an interview as a personal favor 
from me and in no way has been even close to making an improper request.

Please take a look a t his resum, and  tell me how you want to go on this one.

Best,

Ricardo

After almost 13 years with Enron, I've decided to pursue other opportunities 
outside of the company.  While the problems in India remain challenging and I 
have enjoyed my tenure here, the job I've been offered is really too good to 
pass up.  Thus, please consider this e:mail as formal notice of my intention 
to resign from the company, effective close of business June 16, 2001.

On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request 
for FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on 
interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 
requirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway 
were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with 
neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC 
technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal 
of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when 
he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address 
interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's 
active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a 
non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on 
OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, 
Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS 
Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the 
earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical 
Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

		 Subject: Final Report


Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Phil

Subject: Re: EC on energy market distortions  

As anticipated in Peter's e-mail below, please see attached the English 
translation of the relevant abstract (Art 15) from the minutes of yesterday's 
discussion at the Commission. It is indeed quite an encouraging read. Whereas 
the press release sent out before (attached here below as well) suggested 
that the Commission "would consider" adopting its own Directive under the 
provisions of Art. 86 (para 3), the minutes seem to go a step further and 
imply that the Commissions regards it as a next action for itself if the 
Council and the Parliament delay the adoption of the acceleration proposal. 
The text also emphasizes that the Commission's legislation will still have to 
be subject to the "obligations of services of general economic interest", 
which could of course have a negative impact on the content of the actual 
Directive.  The minutes of the Commission's meetings are binding.

Further to Ross's question about "good news for EdF?" see also note below. 

We have subsequently received from Amaia the French text of the Commission's 
discussion yesterday on new measures to address the distortions. It makes 
quite encouraging reading. As would be expected, appararently the two French 
Commissioners were "sticky". Nailia will send you the English version ASAP.

Subject: Note on energy market distortions


Dear Peter,

I have unsuccessfully tried to contact you over the telephone. I therefore
attach some comments on the Commission's note on energy market distortion,
which we will be happy to discuss whenever it is most convenient for you.

The official in charge of the internal note presented today by Commissioner
de Palacio has indicated that the ongoing discussion on EdF's international
activities has required the Commission to provide some indication of what
its attitude will be in the near future regarding possible distortions of
competition in the energy sector. The official has also indicated that the
document seeks to push for the adoption of the Commission proposals for the
completion of the energy internal market which will allow to put an end to
the current distortions.
According to the press release the Commission intends to apply the Treaty's
competition rules in the energy sector and would consider to adopt Decisions
or Directive itself to address possible distortions of competition resulting
from different levels of liberalisation.
We are contacting Commissioner de Palacio's cabinet as well as some other
officials within the Commission and will report to you again on this issue
as soon as possible.

Regards,

Amaia

Eric and Tim -- I spoke with IP last week (Kathy Patton and Joe 
Lakshmanan)and their position is that the word "parallel" in the Terms and 
Conditions refers to load, not generation, thus if any load is capable of 
being served by either self-gen or utility resources, standby charges will be 
imposed -- retroactively, and for five years.  I left the discussion with a 
commitment that Enron would look into how the load was configured.  The 
attached draft letter solicits that, and other, info from ISU.  I think that 
we have to consider that ISU's ability to run its self-gen units without 
paying standby charges was a courtesy IP would only extend to the customer, 
not Enron.  It is not believebale that only now IP learned how the University 
uses its self-gen units -- this was probably a "wink-and-nod" arrangement 
between the two before Enron came into the picture.  
 This raises some possibilities: 1) ISU pays for any standby charges related 
to the units' use;  2) ISU reconfigures,at its cost, each unit so that each 
one is the sole source for the respective load being served; or, 3) there was 
a mutual mistake between Enron and ISU regarding the use of the units in 
question that is so fundamental to the deal that it needs to be unwound.  
This is a dispute for which ISU was at risk regardless of which non-utility 
entity was providing commodity service.
 In any event, I have attached a draft letter to the University that, after 
necessary changes, I believe should go out over you signature TIm.  Please 
look it over at your earliest convenience and let me know what steps you 
would like me to take next.  Thanks.

Rob, further to your two e-mails regarding the discouraging sentiments 
expressed at the IMO Board meeting,  Garrett and I had a very productive 
meeting with Tony Dean, the Assistant Deputy Minister and Assistant Secretary 
of Cabinetand his colleague, Frank Denton, Director, Economic Policy in the 
Cabinet Office.  Dean  was identified by Bill Hawkins as a key voice on the 
electricity file.  He is someone I have been trying to see for two months.  
He was very impressed by Garrett's presentation.  His comments were as 
follows:  a) the mood in gov't is changing; b)  the  political environment 
several months ago (California, high gas prices, and complaining industrials) 
made it very difficult for the gov't to be making a decision at that time  to 
move forward with market opening; c) Enron's message  has been getting 
through" very effectively" (his words) ; and d) the political environment has 
moderated considerably: the differences from California are understood, gas 
prices have come off, and Pickering is evidently  on track.   He emphasized 
that the gov't's announcement on April  23 was "by" May 2002.

Aleck, re OPG and Pickering - too complicated of a message re Harris meeting. 
As per Lavo, he wants 5 simple/straightforward and concise messages that we 
can get accross to Harris. It needs to be short, to the point, concise, and 
simple. By cc to Paul, Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY (you and 
Aleck need to agree on the speaking points - I provided you with my comments 
already). 

One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate to 
you - At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or 
one muni is not ready - the market will not open. I lost my mind, and told 
him that if that is the case, I need to resign as this is a complete waste of 
time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace 
that one rinky-dink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage. Without 
doubt, it was the most frustrating/disappointing statement I've seen 
Guolding/Baillie make - I'm sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after 
that. I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and cc'd to 
Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO 
to be taking.

This message came back to me (too big) - I am resending and will send 
garrett's paper separately.

__________________

Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three 
points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO 
Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving 
Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four 
Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that 
Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior 
people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in 
electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and 
the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the 
Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering 
A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling 
stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the 
government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize 
prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the 
Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting 
until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's 
financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the 
concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may 
be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim "force majeure" in respect of the 
Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition 
of "force majeure"  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if 
OPG  can claim "force majeure",  the predetermined "force majeure replacement 
cost" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to 
offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other 
words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market 
development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe, 
from OPG's perspective, now a "bad deal") that OPG made in 1999.  We should 
discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without 
compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward 
Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and 
day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this 
will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is 
a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away 
from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been 
working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material 
get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event, 
I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board 
and OEB.          `       << File: Market Opening Doc. feb 26 .doc >>  <<

Hemstock/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: IMO Meeting Highlights


Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:

 - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the 
1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news 
is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should 
have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March 
was highly probable.

 - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck 
I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.

 - Forward Market development - IMO "wants to make this happen". Assessing 
two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a 
conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward 
market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked 
re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke 
(WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market 
transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We 
need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market 
place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with 
creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie 
information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want 
to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this 
already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

Colleagues:

Stella Chan, Pat Keene and Harry Kingerski would like to communicate a 
streamlined process to  provide Government and Regulatory support to URM 
(Utility Risk Management).  The process strives to bring GA in the different 
regions, in Houston and URM much closer to each other to provide and 
implement GA service as completely, and cost-effectively as possible.  The 
suggested process includes four steps, namely:   
Curve validation Process, 
Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, 
Coordination of Strategy Development, and 
Coordination of Strategy Implementation.  
A description of these functions are as follows:
Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating, 
every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's 
books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review 
period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA 
personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved.  
Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at 
quantifying--in dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory 
inputs on a specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in 
progress.  This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel 
(also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES 
positions.  The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA.   
Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and 
quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely 
call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of 
Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in 
association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in 
Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma 
Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action 
items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for 
implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, 
and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if 
necessary.
Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it 
shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to 
coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the 
regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the 
implementation as needed.   

To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines 
of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall 
coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional 
wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:
 Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC, 
SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. 
 Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).

>From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the 
Regional Directors  (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry 
shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to 
give regional managers and GA in Houston as much autonomy as possible and 
shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the 
regional directors (usually in the final sprint for approvals).  

Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the 
processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise.   I shall 
contact you to take your suggestion for the most appropriate time for you and 
your group.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question and/or advise.

Rick:   I wanted to give you an update on what's going on with 201 on steel 
imports:

Late Friday evening, Zoellick sent a letter on behalf of the Bush 
Administration to the  International Trade Commission formally initiating a 
Section 201 investigation for the steel industry.  Most, if not all, products 
that Enron imports were included in the scope of the investigation.  

I left messages for Jeff, Tim and Greg Hermans (trading) over the weekend 
that this is now official (they had previously made an announcement that it 
would happen, but we didn't know details because the filing had not been 
made).  

I am working with Jeff M. and Public Affairs on our statement on 201.  It has 
been through several iterations over the past week.   Do you want to review 
before it's finalized?   We do not plan to issue any statements, but we plan 
to talk from these points when asked about our position (by reporters or govt 
officials).   Jeff wants our approach to be "moderate" given where we are 
with the domestic producers.  

We are putting together a timeline for the 201 investigation, spelling out 
important milestones in the process.   This will help our commercial team to 
understand what is coming down the pike (and when).  It looks like the 
investigation will take approx 9-12 months to complete from start to finish.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Lisa

Joe Allen has requested a $500 PAC contribution for Pat Rosenberg, a 
candidate running for HISD.  She is the wife of an Enron employee.  I have 
not requested contributions in school board races since our PAC funds are 
limited.  (Another Enron employee asked for $1000 PAC contribution for 
someone he was personally supporting for school board.)      

Elizabeth Linnell gathered some historical data regarding PAC contributions 
to education candidates:

 The PAC made contributions to the following organizations in 1997 and 1999 
at $1,000 in each case:
  Houston Citizens for Better Education
  Houston Friends for Better Education
  Houston Parents for Better Education
  Houston Taxpayers for Better Education

 In 1995 the PAC gave $500 to Lori Becker, a school board candidate.

Joe said that Pat Rosenberg has $20,000 in her campaign fund and he is trying 
to help her get more money in, as soon as possible, to get her numbers up.  
What are your thoughts regarding PAC contributions to school board 
candidates?  I asked the same question of Sue Walden several weeks ago, and 
she indicated that she does not get involved in school board races.  Thanks,  
Jean

Subject: Re: CAP no MAE  

Luiz,

Thanks again for maintaining a voice of sanity.  

In my not so humble opinion, it is commercial suicide for us to even give the 
appearance of supporting price caps.  I can't think of any other situation 
anywhere in the world where Enron has supported price caps in a market.  To 
the contrary, we are almost always public in our opposition to such 
market-killing sophistry.

Consensus is a noble objective, but sometimes it is just better to let people 
know your true opinion.

Subject: Re: CAP no MAE  

I strongly disagree

"If it is impossible to reach an agreement within ABRADEE",, then we should 
be loud an clear in expressing our own view, to all levels of government 
including a position paper to  Pedro Parente asap.  Caps at this point in 
time may jeopardize the rationing plan per se. We had a victory in anchoring 
the penalties to the MAE price. Why surrender it now? 

Why do we have to abide by ABRADEE's desires? 

This is not a religious issue only.  There are a few US$ million left on the 
table.

How many US$ million are on the table for Enron?

 - Ballpark, possibly  US$20f or Elektro's long position  (60 in EBITDA * 
(680-460)/680)
 - A lot, lot more for Eletrobolt (perhaps to the point of killing the 
project, as Joao Albuquerque stated)

Are we being consistent? About a week ago, we submitted our views to ANEEL, 
on Public Hearing 02/2001, advocating for an increase in the cost of defict 
to US$ 2350/MWh. The trading group (Remi, David) were adamant about this 
position submitted by Regulatory Affairs (I think they are right) 

Are we acting to the best interest of our shareholders?

Subject: CAP no MAE

Algumas empresas de distribui??o short em 02 e 03 est?o defendendo fortememte 
CAP no MAE,  bem abaixo do custo do d,ficit ( cerca de R$ 680). ( CERJ, 
Cataguases, LIght est? em cima do muro, etc...)

Se for inevit?vel, nossa posi??o deve ser:

 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR AO PRE_O PRATICADO NO PRE-RACIONAMENTO ( R$ 460,00 )
 - N?O PODE SER INFERIOR ? MAIOR TARIFA COBRADA DOS CONSUMIDORES  ( TROS 
VEZES A TARIFA RESIDENCIAL  ATUAL - 200% SOBRE A MESMA, PARA CONSUMOS ACIMA 
DE 500 KWh POR MOS) . 

Mazzon, calcule a ordem de grandeza deste valor. _ importante termos isto em 
mente quando formos falar com as autoridades amanh? e, em especial com Mauro 
Arce.

Lembrar, ainda, que um CAP baixo, sem FLOOR, pode matar ELETROBOLT, uma vez 
que as receitas que esta auferiria em 2002 n?o compensariam o decr,scimo das 
mesmas de 2003 em diante, quando, com a redu??o de mercado devido ao 
racionamento e o aumento de entrada de novas fontes de gera??o, tamb,m 
incentivada pelo racionamento, poder? derrubar fortemente os pre?os do MAE. 
N?o devemos nos esquecer que o per?odo de amortiza??o de ELETROBOLT , de 
cinco anos.

FYI  - I think we can make a case that we are still in the running on the 
basis of the highlighted portions. 

__________________


Mr. Speaker:
This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the
province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a
safe, reliable and affordable supply of power.
When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us.
Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.
Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And
we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third
highest in Canada.
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and
competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of
date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.
That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:
The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the
electricity market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is
committed to an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and
reliable supply.
There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to
competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive
markets are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and
benefit consumers.
There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like
to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to
ensure the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are
committed to opening the market at the earliest possible date, while
ensuring all of the conditions required for a smooth transition to
competition are met.
And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding
the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.

First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The
overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition
puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to
the lowest possible costs and better service for all.
Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of
electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current
needs. Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater
certainty to potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion
dollars in new generation projects.
Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the
Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity
sector. They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the
requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new
electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the
province's environmental assessment process.
And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the
search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will
be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they
want, including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help
promote the demand for cleaner, greener electricity.

And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity
sector will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to
introduce a competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put
the principles in place to ensure that we do it right.

Thank you.

Ken,

I've sent your letter to the Governor and top legislators.

I'm also working with David Freeman in the governor's office as well to try
to keep sce out of bankruptcy.

It's unfortunate that government doesn't work more like business. There
seems to be no sense of urgency in finding the facts to make an intelligent
decision, just people who don't want to make any decision even to do that.

On a side note, Propel develops software that makes it much easier to
develop 24x7 mission critical systems including very advanced data
management. Is there someone who you'd recommend I can talk with on the
energy trading side of enron to explore the potential of our helping you
make your systems more reliable/scalable/easier to maintain?

Thanks!

-steve

FYI - This is something a little different for me.  I discussed these 
opportunities to Duran last month and they appear to have some juice.  Tony 
Ravosa is a contact of mine who has had me in front of Gov Rowland on a 
regular basis, which led to the Conn. sites.  The NY site however is the most 
attractive.  I will keep you posted as to the outcome. Steve

Tony -

Thank you for spending so much time with me the last several days.  Driving 
out to Brookhaven, LI, to meet with Steve and me was really beyond the call 
of duty.  Your efforts there and in Connecticut gave me a very good initial 
idea of the opportunities we may have in these two locations.

My first pass look at the New Britain and Waterbury sites in Connecticut 
suggest that they will certainly be permittable.  The support from the local 
municipalities and the Governor which you described is encouraging.  My next 
step on these sites is to get an indication internally as to how interested 
Enron is, strategically and financially, in Connecticut power.  I know that 
you want a statement of interest fairly quickly from us, so you can offer the 
opportunities to other developers if we decline.

The Brookhaven site on Long Island also looks interesting, and we have 
already stated our interest in New York power.  The good news and the bad 
news of this site is that AEP controls a 20-acre site a half mile away from 
it.  The good part  is that AEP has already initially identified the gas, 
power, and water interconnections for this area, and shown that a power plant 
is environmentally low impact here.  The bad news is that a second plant now 
might exceed LIPA's and the local communities capacity for power.  My next 
steps are to informally identify the transmission constraints.  I have 
already talked to Dan Staines about this, and Monday we tentatively decided 
to seek a meeting with Steve's contact at KeySpan the week of May 16th when 
I'm back in New York.

Finally, we discussed hypothetically what The Vince Group's interest would be 
in these sites, should we decide to pursue any of them.  You would be most 
interested in being retained as the local facilitator for these projects, 
which Steve agrees you are very capable of doing, with a success payment to 
you upon deal closure, to reimburse you for bringing these sites to us.  I 
will investigate internally if this is workable.

Tony, thank you again for your time and interest.  I will get back to you as 
I complete my initial investigations in the next two weeks on these three 
sites.

Rick

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the 
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses 
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.  
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and Means, 
Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.  Thus, the 
House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August 
Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen 
Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity 
issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he 
chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues 
other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly held out hope of 
marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee 
do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate side, the majority 
staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that may be circulated for 
comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and 
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) 
that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially 
ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis 
(with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation 
added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available 
power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had 
pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only" bill.)

3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural 
Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation facility" shall 
not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has 
abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some instances of "old" 
pipelines being considered as "historic places" under federal law.  The House 
Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday.

4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the 
president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down 
to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and 
Democrats to this amendment.

5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to 
set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and 
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 
percent).

California Update: Duke Energy Proposes Settlement Deal 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE][IMAGE]Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) approached Calif. Gov. Gray Davis with 
a secret deal, now made public, that offered monetary concessions if the 
state drops lawsuits and investigations into the company's alleged price 
gouging. Duke made the offer in a secret 17-page letter sent in April to Gov. 
Davis' office, which the governor confirmed on May 2. Davis' spokesman called 
the letter Duke's "wish list," which included having the state call off 
investigations of the North Carolina-based generator. Although Gov. Davis has 
acknowledged receipt of the proposal, he has not officially accepted or 
rejected the offer. 

Analysis: Duke's desire to make a settlement with the state of California 
stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March. At that 
time, FERC put 13 California power sellers, including Duke, on notice that 
they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further 
justification for their prices. Duke is considered to be one of four 
companies (along with Dynegy, Reliant and Williams) that faces the biggest 
potential refunds to the state of California. In fact, Duke reportedly faces 
potential refunds of up to $20 million for the power that it has sold to 
California since the start of this year. 

We can fast forward from FERC's investigation to Duke's "good faith" 
settlement offer that now sits before Gov. Gray Davis. The plan sets out 
specific action steps for new generation, conservation programs, electric and 
gas infrastructure improvements, regional transmission frameworks, and 
environmental goals. In addition, Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement 
agreement, for which the California government would agree to cease all 
ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company. Duke's 
"appropriate payment" is based on fair estimate of the company's alleged 
overcharges for power that it sold to the state.  

Yet, beyond the spin control surrounding this offer, Duke's proposal amounts 
to a mutual back-scratching agreement, with Duke clearly obtaining the 
largest benefit. Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that 
allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke 
made by the governor and others. In return, Duke will refund to the state 
some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping 
the state with its power supply needs. However, under the offer Duke will 
admit no wrongdoing. Rather, the company's proposal is being presented as an 
altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of California's flawed market. 
Neither Duke nor Gov. Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Duke's 
settlement offer, but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction 
of the $20 million that the state wants. 

Other specifics within Duke's proposal that are important to note include the 
company's "commitment to work with the state to get 680 MW of additional 
peaking capacity ready for summer 2002." In addition, Duke has offered to 
enter into long-term contracts with the state on "reasonable terms" and also 
"attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state." 
Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Duke's pledge 
to "share the financial pain" of California's troubled market with other 
market participants. 

Presently, Duke supplies about 5 percent of California's power needs, the 
majority of which is based on long-term contracts. This is a significant 
point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market 
is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market, in contrast to many of the 
other power suppliers under FERC's investigation. The company also owns the 
Moss Landing plant, located south of San Jose, Calif., which it is upgrading 
with a $500 million investment. Duke has established that the plant should be 
able to provide approximately 30 percent of California's new generation in 
2002.  

While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits, the 
company's total wholesale profits soared 374 percent to $744 million for 
year-end 2000. For the year, Duke's California power plants generated 70 
percent more electricity than they did in 1999. In addition, in 2000 the 
plants provided 17 million megawatt hours of electricity to the state's power 
grid versus 9.5 million the previous year. 

Further, in January and February 2001, Duke charged more for power through 
"credit premiums," which were levied because of the risk of non-payment 
associated with California's financially struggling utilities. Duke claims 
that it is still owed about $100 million by the Department of Water 
Resources, California's power purchaser. 

Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California. On 
May 2, Tulsa-based Williams Co. (also one of the top four companies 
reportedly owing the most to California) announced that it has agreed to pay 
$8 million to the California ISO to end FERC's investigation into whether the 
company's plants were kept offline to drive up prices. For several months, 
FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the company's alleged shutdown 
of two power generation units owned by AES, which reportedly allowed Williams 
to sell power from other units at higher prices. The stipulation and consent 
agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties. In 
other words, Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing 
or price manipulation. A Williams spokesperson has said that the $8 million 
will be deducted from the $252 million that Williams is still owed for power 
sales to the California ISO and the California PX.  

Much like Duke, Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year. For 
year-end 2000, the company reported unaudited income from continuing 
operations of $873.2 million, or $1.95 per share on a diluted basis, versus 
$178 million, or 40 cents per share on a restated basis, for 1999. In 
addition, the company reported 1Q 2001 unaudited results that were more than 
double that of 1Q 2000-$378 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with a 
restated $139 million, or 31 cents per share.  

Moreover, the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of 
California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made 
from power sales to the state. However, one benefit of the deals is that they 
would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation. Yet, at least as 
of this writing, Gov. Davis remains less than enthused about Duke's offer and 
has not eased off from his accusation that Duke (along with the other power 
generators) has "bilked millions of dollars from California consumers." In 
fact, although the governor has said that he is willing to continue 
negotiations with the various power generators, he has also vowed "not to 
call off the dogs" in the state and federal investigation of any price 
gouging. Toward that end, the state's lieutenant governor has initiated a 
class-action suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other 
power generators accused of price fixing. This legal claim follows similar 
suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego. All of 
the suits basically claim the same thing, that Duke and four other power 
generators engaged in unlawful trading practices-such as shutting down 
plants-to drive up market prices in California.  

Duke, of course, maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely 
makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied. 
Nevertheless, Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California, 
which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings 
or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the company's part could eventually 
be determined. The stakes have also been raised with some California 
attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price 
gouging should face civil and criminal penalties, which could include 
incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the 
price manipulation to take place. Consequently, despite Duke's offer and any 
other proposals that subsequently come from power generators, it appears that 
litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable.

This law appears to supercede state laws and allows for electronic 
signatures.  Perhaps this should be circulated to everyone in Rick's group.

Both the NCLC Energy List and NARUC Consumer Affairs folks will be
interested in S. 761 which was enacted by Congress and is awaiting
President's signature.  This legislation creates an "electronic
signature" law and preempts any state law to the contrary.  There is an
exception for a number of written signature requirements and
notification of information in writing, including an exemption for
"cancellation or termination of utlity services (including water, heat
and power)" [Section 103(b)(3)]  Please note the absence of specific
reference to telephone service, but the term "utility service" may
suffice.

My preliminary reading suggests that this statute would preempt a state
law or regulation that requires a customer to enroll with a competitive
supplier with a "wet signature."

This legislation does not require a customer to agree to provide a
signature electronically, but does prevent a state from prohibiting a
commercial entity from seeking an electronic signature as a valid and
legal signature.

Rick and Sue,

I exhausted many resources in my attempt to get this information (Enron 
Investor Relations, our PR group, newswires, Wall Street websites, etc.).  I 
found nothing, and then called the TR Daily editorial staff.  Here's what I 
learned:

Powell met with Frank Governali on May 30 to discus Powell's 
interest/determination in promoting competition in the CLEC sector.  
Governali is an analyst w/ Goldman, Sachs.  Accompanying Governali were 6-8 
of his largest clients, primarily pension and/or mutual fund managers.  The 
editorial staff member I spoke with indicated that the names of the fund 
managers are typically not disclosed publicly, and TR does not know their 
identities.

I was also told that Powell met with Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hexter and 
possibly Adam Quinton (heavily active in the telecom industry) on 
May 31.  The topic was the same as the May 30 meeting w/ Goldman, Sachs.  
Another meeting is planned for the near future (perhaps today?) with Lehman 
Bros.  The analyst is not definitively known, but is suspected to be Blake 
Bath.

I hope this has been somewhat helpful.  I will watch the press for any 
additional information in the coming days and will forward anything that I 
find to you.  Please let me know if you need anything further - and keep the 
inquiries coming - I enjoy the challenge!

As you may recall, Portland General submitted a request to FERC for 
authorization to use EnronOnline.  Due to FERC's affiliate restrictions, PGE 
currently is not able to use EnronOnline and is concerned that it is being 
excluded from parts of the market due to the restrictions.  We made a similar 
filing on behalf of EPMI, proposing to remove the affiliate restrictions for 
those transactions that EPMI enters into with PGE through EnronOnline.

The PGE and EPMI filings are on FERC's July 11 agenda.  Although the FERC 
staffers conducting the inquiry into EnronOnline have told us that their 
inquiry is not related to the PGE and EPMI applications, FERC's order will be 
the first pronouncement from FERC on EnronOnline since this new inquiry began.

We'll keep you posted and will send out the order as soon as we receive it.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

I just had the opportunity to review a report issued by the ICC assessing 
retail and wholesale competition in Illinois.  If you would like a hard copy, 
let me know.  Salient facts/ conclusions are as follows:

1.  Switching rates are high in Com Ed territory only.  By end of 2000, 22% 
of eligible customers had switched, representing 62% of usage. Larger usage 
customers are switching with greater frequency than smaller usage customers.  
Approximately 40% of delivery service customers were using the PPO.  Approx. 
8 marketers are active in Com Ed with only 3or 4 acquiring significant 
numbers of customers.

2.  ICC believes retail prices may increase dramatically in 2005 by the time 
the general rate freeze expires.

3.  ICC is concerned about wholesale competition noting that utilization of 
the PPO evidences little physical delivery by suppliers.  ICC is also 
concerned about the ability of the Illinois transmission system to support a 
competitive wholesale market within and between utilities.  The number of 
TLR's attained record levels last years and there are concerns about managing 
load pockets.  If the situation remains unchanged, retail prices will be 
higher than they would have been had the market structure supported wholesale 
competition.

4.  Non-Coincident Peak demand in Illinois in 1999 was 29,561Mw and 28,040MW 
in 2000, however overall growth in demand is 1.4%.

5. The most successful suppliers are either Illinois utilities or affiliates 
of Illinois gas and electric utilities, raising market power concerns.

6.  ICC is investigating the capacity of the Illinois utilities' transmission 
and distribution systems.  As part of the study, the ICC will be developing a 
comprehensive computer simulation model of the regional transmission grid to 
identify problem spots on the grid including potential load pockets as well 
as inter-utility constraints that may limit wholesale deliveries during 
critical peak hours.  This will assist in state and federal proceedings.

7.  The ICC is concerned about the market power exercised by utilities and 
has been collecting data  on each utility's interconnection and transmission 
queues to watch for signs of favoritism directed towards their affiliates  or 
any other violations of FERC Order 888.

Hope this is useful.

On behalf of Government Affairs, Bob Frank and I thank you for taking time on 
January 11 to join us for the presentation on the potential impact of 
international trade rules on your business units.  I am requesting your 
feedback regarding the trade regulation seminar.  We are trying to gauge the 
level of interest/need among traders, originators and other EIM personnel 
before retaining Powell Goldstein to monitor international trade issues and 
developments for EIM. We spoke to several of you after the seminar and heard 
some interest.    For the pulp/paper group, the most pressing issues related 
to the upcoming expiration of the US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement and 
anti-dumping litigation.  On the steel side, the primary issues include 
ongoing anti-dumping litigation, the possibility of a multilateral steel 
agreement and potential congressional initiatives.  Please e-mail me your 
thoughts or call me at (202) 466-9158.   

As promised, attached below is the power point presentation that Dan Price 
referred to during the seminar (in Lotus Note File Viewer).

P.S. For those of you that attended the afternoon seminar and expressed 
concern about Peter Suchman, he has fully recovered from what turned out to 
be a bad case of stomach flu.

Here is a first  publishable draft.? This has benefited greatly from comments 
by Richard,  Judy, and of course Dan, but wcp takes full responsibility.
?
Careful further  review by all is needed.? I can identify two basic problems: 
the repeated  statistics for use of the grids are believed to be about right, 
but we lack  authoritative sources and we need to go with something firmer 
(as we in the  power biz say); second, the examples given both late in the 
statement and near  the end of the brief have been reworked by me in light of 
some very helpful  conversations yesterday, but I may not have gotten them 
right, or put them as  well as I could have; these also need citations if 
possible.
?
I will be out of  play until late morning Monday (going to Charlottesville 
for a speech by my  spouse).? Comments should be routed to others on the WCP 
team as well  as?me.? We hope to have all significant comments by the end of 
next  week (earlier?where possible of course), so that we can put the brief 
in  final shape over the weekend.
?
Thanks to  all.

Lisa,

Here is a letter from USTR Zoellick to Senator Hatch regarding
Administration action on steel, which states that the Administration is
considering all options, including Section 201.

Thanks,
Leslie 

Text: Zoellick Letter on Steel
_______________________________________________
Date: May 18, 2001 - Inside US Trade - 


May 7, 2001

The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch
Chairman, Trade Subcommittee
Finance Committee
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Hatch:

President Bush has asked me to respond to your recent letter regarding the
troubling developments in the U.S. steel industry. The Administration is
very concerned about the issues you have raised.

This Administration is committed to the swift and strong enforcement of the
trade laws. There are currently more than 150 anti-dumping and
countervailing duty actions in effect or under investigation relating to
steel products. In addition, the steel industry is currently receiving
import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 for line pipe and
steel wire rod products.

However, despite the measures that are currently in place, we continue to be
concerned about the health of the steel industry. I and other senior
Administration officials have begun meeting with representatives of the
steel industry to determine what additional actions are needed. We are
carefully considering all options, including further action under Section
201 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.

We will continue to monitor conditions in the industry and will take
additional actions as needed to strengthen the future for U.S. steel
workers, their employers and our nation's economy.

Sincerely,

Robert B. Zoellick

Rick - FYI - I was responsible for bring this company to David Cox and 
setting up the meeting referenced in the proposal attached.  At that meeting 
Cox basically offered UT&S a 10% commission if they could bring a cutomer to 
EBS.  Based on conversations that I have had with John DiDario, he has 
several customers to bring.  Revenues on 1 customer, on a 5 year deal exceeds 
$150 million.  I am concerned about feedback that I am getting about our 
"network".  I will discuss with you when I get back from vacation.
 On a related note, I am in the process of setting up a meeting between EBS 
and Global One (France Telecom).  GLobal One has indicated that they are 
interested in "all the bandwidth capacity" that we have to offer.  
I hope one or both of these close!

Subject: Northeast Water Plant

February 26, 2001

I note that the HAWC and the Northeast Water Plant is on the Infrastructure 
Committee's agenda tomorrow at Houston City Council.

I am concerned about the proposed Azurix project with the Houston Area 
Water Corporation and the City of Houston. Two weeks ago I met with the 
Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me 
of their concern about the future of Azurix.  They wanted some assurance 
from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were 
awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.  I believe they had some 
communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from 
someone at Enron.

I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should 
contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance 
they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.

Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through 
me had any results.  Had he heard from Enron?  He said no, and that he 
needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.

I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my 
conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor 
from someone high up in the Enron organization.

George

Two weeks ago, Phil Harris sent a letter to the CEOs of PJM member-companies 
urging them to designate a representative to participate in PJM's 
Communications Group.  The initial step would be to highlight the four years 
of success in the PJM wholesale market and enhance the public's confidence in 
the value of competitive electric markets.  

Since Enron has already committed money to EPSA's multi-state communications 
effort as well as an aggressive communications plan in NY, I thought it would 
be useful to meet with PJM's manager of communications to try and get a 
better idea of what they are trying to achieve.  

On Friday, June 1st, I met with Beth Foley -- PJM's Manager of 
Communications.  Beth is new to PJM.  The bottom line is that PJM has never 
had a communications office.  Press inquiries and other external 
communications have been handled from PJM's customer care center.  This year, 
PJM decided it needed to create a new division to deal soley with 
communications/pr issues.

As of last week, 35 member companies had responded to the letter from Phil 
Harris.  The next step is likely to be a meeting of all the interested 
companies in PA.  

They're starting from ground zero, so I shared some of Enron's experiences in 
NY and DC with her:

Research is useful in order to define message points, and keep the effort 
focused
Many companies are being asked to fund various "communications plans" as a 
result of the CA fallout.  These companies (including Enron) expect their 
dollars to create value for them, and if the communications efforts are 
repetitive or not providing value then the efforts aren't worth funding.
External assistance in the development of a pr plan are extremely useful and 
necessary for comprehensive efforts.
Buy-in from member companies on the message points will be a critical first 
step and will require a good amount of time in the early stages.
Need to identify the overall goal and time-frame for achieving them.  (PJM is 
not really attempting to do a "summer crisis" effort.  Their's is much more 
long-term focused.

Tom Hoatson and I are on PJM's list as contacts for this effort.  And I 
expect to hear back from PJM in the near future regarding a meeting of all 
the interested parties.

Please call if you have questions.

This was an article written in response to the piece by Prof Krugman in the 
New York Times several weeks ago. I know that Foster spent some time on the

Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task 
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so 
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price 
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just "Econ 101." 
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the 
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in 
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with 
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a 
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to 
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and 
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a "gang 
of ten" economists including Alfred Kahn, "the architect of airline 
deregulation under President Carter." But price caps don't work. As President 
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, "[P]rice 
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply." 
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we 
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, 
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose 
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more 
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his 
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of 
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time 
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be 
"just enough" to call forth the right amount of new power. "Nobody," he 
writes, "has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power 
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the power supply?"
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn 
that "strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies 
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need 
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually 
lead to higher output." This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up 
his hands and says "No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you 
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And 
which way is it to the airport?"
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that "That's not an 
argument you want to use too often." In fact, the argument is dangerous 
nonsense. There is no "monopoly" supplier of energy to California (although 
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the 
"commanding heights" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both 
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as 
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices 
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have 
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it 
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that 
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of 
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing 
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the 
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective 
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except 
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that "generating 
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut." 
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for 
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that 
California's problems are all due to market "manipulation" by big energy 
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide 
assertion that President Bush's "knee-jerk ideologue" advisers may be "so 
close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that 
whatever is good for Enron is good for America." The presence in California 
of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the 
state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer, 
Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise 
campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business 
executives somehow go together nicely.

I have forwarded separately GA top 10 goals for EES.  While there will be 
need for refinement and additional discussion, I would like to see us start 
now to develop strategies for these goals.  Below I've suggested people in 
our organization who could serve as "issue leaders"  who could take on the 
task of more fully defining the goal, developing the strategy, and developing 
the metric by which performance is measured.  I would work with these people 
and do whatever necessary to coordinate, direct, etc. 

Are you ok with this approach and with the designated leads?  (Suggested 
leads are shown on the last page)  I think many of these goals are also good 
categories to state previous results.



For example, one of the goals we should move on quickly (which you have 
mentioned to me) and which is listed as #10 is the "improve communication".  
We could do this initially through the monthly newsletter and perhaps a 
client survey which measures EES Mgmt.'s satisfaction with GA.  I would think 
and like if someone with some PR pizazz could take these and run with them.  
The newsletter should look professional and, I think, be a joint publication 
with EES (which I've talked to Peggy Mahoney about). It would be great if the 
first edition could be out in a couple ow weeks.

All of the other goals pretty much have a similar story - some immediate need 
which needs a lot of attention.  I think we would be most effective enlisting 
the right people to champion each of these.

A bill introduced in Ohio would have required Enron to become certified and 
pay the OCC and PUCO assessments.  Other provisions called for allowing the 
LDC to tack on a surcharge to recover from all customers the additional costs 
incurred as a result of a defaulting supplier.  Further provisions allow for 
a municipal aggregation pilot with the authority granted to the PUCO to allow 
the program to be expanded to all municipalities at the end of three years.  
At that point, the utilities could seek stranded costs, however it is 
questionable how much they would actually have.

Fortunately, we were able to get an amendment that limited the applicability 
of all these regulations and costs (assessments, surcharges and stranded 
costs) to just the "choice" customers.  Choice customers are primarily 
residential customers operating under the PUCO approved programs established 
in the Columbia, East Ohio and Cinergy service territories.  The threshold 
for regulation, etc is to exempt a mercantile customer who is defined as " a 
customer that consumes, other than for residential use, more than five 
hundred thousand cubic feet of natural gas per year at a single location 
within this state or is part of an undertaking having more than three 
locations within or outside this state."  This should cover most, if not all 
our customers.

The status of the bill is that it has passed committee and the Speaker is 
going to pass it out of the House without amendment.  We are hearing that the 
Senate will accept no amendments either, however, that remains to be seen.  
Barbara and I are monitoring this closely and will keep you posted.

In an effort to control costs for travel expenses, as Jeff Skilling suggested 
in his floor meeting last week,  Rick would like for everyone to purchase 
tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred 
travel agent for Enron.  The savings that Enron receives from using TAP is 
insurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with 
some of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least 
3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential 
switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for 
hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the 
corporate rate.  TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address: 
http://www.travelpark.com)

AIRLINE CONTRACTS
America West  15%
American 28%
Continental 17%....25% full business and coach fares US50 to/from Europe
Delta 5-28%
Northwest/KLM 20 - 30% domestic....25% international
TWA 21% - 54% domestic and Houston-Toronto only
United 28%
US Airways 30%
British Air 15 - 35%

Also, if at any time you are interested in having your spouse travel with you 
on a business trip, at the company's expense,  it is necessary for you to 
have spousal approval.  This approval is needed in advance of the trip, by 
your immediate supervisor and Rick Shapiro.  Below you will find an attached 
spousal approval form.

It's late (even in Houston!) but here are five for the Brussels office, plus 
Continental Power,  plus France, Belgium and NL:
 1. Arcos gas TPA (anti-trust angles).
 2. Cross border power transmission CWE - eliminating transaction based 
tariffs and achieving transparency/ non discrimination in allocation of ATC.
 3. Freeing up more power export transmission capacity from, and optimising 
forthcoming auction of virtual generating capacity inside, France.
 4. Resolving restrictions on availability to new entrants of power import 
transmission capacity into NL.
 5. Achieving power transit without additional tariff through, and wholesale 
power TPA inside, Belgium.

The Capacity Auction Agreement Working Group for ERCOT (CAAWG - ERCOT) will=
=20
be the forum to work on the implementation of the standard form agreement a=
nd=20
resolution of issues related to using capacity auction products in the=20
ancillary services markets of ERCOT. The CAAWG - ERCOT will hold its meetin=
gs=20
at the Commission where a member of the Commission's Market Oversight=20
Division will be present.  This group will be filing its final work product=
=20
in Central Records at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001, for public comment prior=
=20
to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.=20

The SPP Stakeholders will be filing a standard form agreement and resolutio=
n=20
of issues related to the use of capacity auction products in the SPP=20
ancillary services markets at the Commission at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001=
=20
for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001=
=20
Open Meeting. Because the structure of the SPP ancillary services market is=
=20
still under development, the focus will be on ERCOT and input and assistanc=
e=20
from SPP staff will be sought in the coming weeks.

The Working Groups are a direct result of the PUCT Capacity Auction Order. =
=20
The current time line proposes meeting weekly as Stakeholders to work to=20
resolve the issues, schedules and final products to be included in the=20
auction this fall.  Under the current proposal the Capacity Auction Product=
s=20
will be Baseline, Gas Intermediate, Gas Cyclic and Gas Peaking.  Each of th=
e=20
PGCs must auction 15% of the Texas Jurisdictional Installed Generation=20
Capacity.  The capacity will be sold as a "slice of the system" of each of=
=20
the divesting PGCs and will not be for any specific unit.  During the month=
s=20
of March, April May, October, and November of each year the available=20
entitlements may be reduced proportionately to the average planned plant=20
outage.  With respect to the firmness of the products, the PUCT found that=
=20
the products should be 100% financially firm to provide potential buyers of=
=20
the entitlements certainty in the products that they are buying.  Forced=20
outages are limited to 2.0% of the hours of the entitlement.

The Power Generation Companies (PGCs)  have recommended using the EEI Maste=
r=20
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement and Schedule CA will describe the product=
s=20
available for auction.  A copy of Schedule CA will be attached below for yo=
ur=20
review and comment.  Please note that the Schedule CA is not a final docume=
nt=20
and is an initial proposal from the PGCs.  Your review and comments will be=
=20
essential.  Also, if you have any questions or comments as to the process o=
f=20
the CAAWG or the auction process in general please feel free to call me.  T=
he=20
working group will meet each Wednesday for the balance of April after which=
=20
the working group will meet May 1st and May 2nd in anticipation of the=20
proposed May 4th filing date.  After the filing, Enron will have the=20
opportunity to file written comments with the PUCT.  The Auction process=20
under the rule must be completed prior to September 1, 2001 for the initial=
=20
auction period.

The following is an initial list of issues. =20

1. What is the timing of schedules for each of the products from the buyer =
of=20
the entitlement to the seller of the entitlement.
2. Are ancillary services available from the Baseload product?  TXU has=20
stated that they cannot provide A/S from their Baseload units.  As   such,=
=20
should A/S be removed from all Baseload product offerings from all PGCs so=
=20
that there is a standard product or should the Baseload   offerings include=
=20
ancillary services when and where available.  The argument distills to if t=
he=20
entitlement is more valuable in the market as a   standardized product or a=
=20
differentiated product that may or may not include A/S.
3. What is the delivery point for the entitlement and other operational=20
issues?  Should it be a single bus, multiple busses or congestion zones.   =
=20
Congestion zones may change each year, under the current auction schedule,=
=20
you would bid for the product before you know the final congestion  zone.
4. How (or if possible) can responsibility transfers be used for balancing=
=20
energy?
5. Who will receive OOM payments?
6. What about compensation for other A/S payments?
7. Does released capacity exist, should it exist at all?  If so, what happe=
ns=20
when the capacity is released.  The PGC would like the offering to look lik=
e =20
a call option.  If the option is not exercised by scheduling, then the=20
capacity is deemed released.  This is the interpretation of the PGC=01,s an=
d=20
not   necessarily that of the PUCT or other Stakeholders.
8. How much of a product or entitlement is available in A/S?

   The order adopting the final rule can be found at   =20
http://www.puc.state.tx.us/rules/rulemake/21405/121900adt.pdf  the actual  =
  =20
rule starts at page 41 of 65.

Kyoto Protocol Becomes New Albatross for Bush Administration=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]President Bush and European leaders "agreed to disagree" over a glob=
al=20
warming treaty, as the president sought to reassure allies that sharp polic=
y=20
differences would not hamper relations between Europe and the United States=
.=20
During several closed-door sessions, Bush and his European counterparts=20
confronted one of their most contentious areas of disagreement: the=20
president's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. "We agreed t=
o=20
disagree," Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters. "The Europe=
an=20
Union is sticking to the Kyoto Protocol. The United States has chosen anoth=
er=20
policy."=20

Analysis: It is rather amazing how prominently energy issues have factored=
=20
into the first six months of the Bush administration. In contrast to the=20
eight years of the Clinton administration, when energy policy often took a=

backseat to other concerns, President Bush=0F-a result of California blacko=
uts,=20
a national shortage of natural gas, sky-high electricity prices, and a=20
controversial energy task plan=0F-been comparatively consumed by energy iss=
ues.=20
Now, in a political legacy from the previous administration, President Bush=
=20
finds himself grappling with another contentious energy problem that has=20
global ramifications. Departing from what appears to be an international=20
consensus, President Bush has declared the Kyoto Protocol an ineffective=20
treaty and has instead decided to further examine the greenhouse gas proble=
m,=20
which has raised further questions about the president's commitment to=20
environmental issues.=20

First, let me provide some background. The Kyoto Protocol developed out of=
=20
meetings held in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, during which time the Unite=
d=20
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in principle to a=20
series of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. About 170=20
governments of various countries, including the United States, participated=
=20
in the Protocol and agreed to reduce their aggregate carbon dioxide (CO2)=
=20
equivalent emissions by at least 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.=20
Noticeably exempt from the Protocol were developing countries such as China=
=20
and India=0F-of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world&#151which=
=20
resisted taking on any sort of formal reduction plan until industrialized=
=20
countries proceeded with their own. This marked the central flaw in the=20
Protocol in that participants such as Europe, Japan and the United States=
=20
argued that it would be impossible to reach the Protocol's goals without th=
e=20
active and controlled participation of developing countries. Consequently,=
=20
the United States could not garner two-thirds support from the Senate, whic=
h=20
would be required to ratify the Protocol, despite endorsement from the=20
Clinton administration. The United States is the largest emitter of CO2,=20
accounting for one-quarter of the world total per year, and thus its=20
participation in the Protocol has been considered essential.=20

The Protocol's emissions targets include all major greenhouse gases: carbon=
=20
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (NOx), and greenhouse gases created by=20
industrial processes, which are artificial chemicals called halocarbons=20
(CFCs, HFCs and PFCs) and long-lived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride=20
(SF6). The Protocol requires the main developed countries to reduce their=
=20
emissions of the greenhouse gases by varying amounts: 8 percent for Europea=
n=20
Union countries, 7 percent for the United States and 6 percent for Japan. =
=20

With the onset of his new administration, President Bush announced last Mar=
ch=20
that the United States would not support the Kyoto Protocol, again arguing=
=20
that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic.=
=20
Further, Bush has voiced the concern that ratifying the Protocol would=20
severely damage the U.S. economy as it would restrict industrial production=
.=20
The president has also pointed out that, although European nations espouse=
=20
support for the Protocol, none of the EU members has yet to ratify the=20
treaty. Instead, President Bush has adopted a "go-slow" approach toward=20
global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem=
=20
and work with other nations to produce a better plan. =20

A new report from the National Academy of Sciences, requested by the Bush=
=20
administration, found that global warming is indeed occurring as the result=
=20
of human activity. Specifically, the report found that the Earth's=20
temperatures could rise between 2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end =
of=20
this century. On the other hand, the report could not reliably establish ho=
w=20
much of the warming trends result from natural variations, how fast future=
=20
warming will occur or how corrective actions might correct it. Thus, the=20
president asserted that these unanswered questions warranted further=20
investigation into the greenhouse gas problem. =20

The president has come under fire both domestically and abroad for what is=
=20
perceived as a policy that gives preference to business over the environmen=
t.=20
In addition to his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, President Bush also=20
announced in March that he opposes any domestic restrictions in CO2 emissio=
ns=20
from the nation's power plants, retracting on a pledge that he had made=20
during his campaign. Carbon dioxide is not classified as a pollutant by the=
=20
Clean Air Act, and thus the White House said that Bush's original promise w=
as=20
a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of increasing=20
domestic energy production. Toward that end, the Bush administration has=20
focused on the construction of some 1,900 new power plants across the count=
ry=20
to resolve a growing supply / demand imbalance. On the other hand, business=
=20
groups have applauded the president's approach, echoing his belief that the=
=20
Protocol would harm the nation's economy and that domestic, technology-base=
d=20
solutions represent a better solution.=20

This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th=
e=20
debate. I won't use this space to criticize or defend President Bush's=20
environmental stand. Instead, I think it will be useful to clearly identify=
=20
the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto=
=20
Protocol. European leaders have vowed to enact the Protocol without the=20
United States, which may not be possible. The Protocol can only be enacted =
if=20
nations that produced 55 percent of the industrialized world's carbon dioxi=
de=20
in 1990 decide to ratify it. Japan could be the wild card in the debate, as=
=20
it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it. I=
f=20
Japan does participate, proponents of the Protocol would have 57.5 percent =
of=20
1990 emissions (enough for ratification). =20

Nevertheless, here is how the two approaches shake out:=20

The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside=
nt=20
Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal (expected some time th=
is=20
summer), in a recent radio address. "With new technology, sound regulation=
=20
and plain good sense, we can expand our energy production while protecting=
=20
the environment," the president said. The Bush administration's previously=
=20
released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nation's energy=
=20
supply through the expedited construction of new generation (including=20
nuclear power plants). Further, the president has said that "energy=20
production and environmental protection are not competing priorities" and c=
an=20
both be achieved with new technology. =20

While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions=
=20
for limiting CO2 emissions from existing or new plants, the new technology =
to=20
which he has referred most likely includes clean-coal technologies that can=
=20
be implemented to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. As noted in the=
=20
3/27/01 IssueAlert, new, clean-coal technologies are being tested and=20
developed by various companies throughout the United States. One example is=
=20
the integrated gasification-combined cycle (IGCC) technology that first=20
converts coal into a combustible gas, cleans the gas of virtually all=20
pollutants, then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas. More tha=
n=20
99 percent of sulfur, nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in=
=20
the process. Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida,=20
Indiana and Nevada. As coal remains the United States' most abundant fuel=
=20
source, constituting 95 percent of our nation's fossil energy reserves, muc=
h=20
of the nation's plan for reducing emissions will focus on coal-fired=20
generation. It is important to note, however, that most of the clean-coal=
=20
technologies currently being developed eliminate SO2 pollutants and NOx, bu=
t=20
may do little to address CO2 emissions, which is the primary focus of the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol.=20

President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high=
=20
priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi=
ve=20
years, and help developing nations such as China and India to match the U.S=
.=20
commitment.=20

The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has=
=20
said that the 15 European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the=
=20
Kyoto Protocol. As noted, the participation of another large industrialized=
=20
country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol. If the=20
Protocol is enacted, an international conference will be held in Bonn,=20
Germany, this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b=
e=20
reached. Toward this end, French President Jacques Chirac recently commente=
d=20
that, "Now is not the time to conduct new studies. These studies have alrea=
dy=20
been done. We have to set objectives." Specifically, European countries wil=
l=20
proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc=
h=20
as CO2 produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels. The EU has said=20
that, if ratified, it will comply with the Protocol's standards for emissio=
ns=20
reduction by 2012 and go "significantly further" to reduce emissions beyond=
=20
that date. Yet, interestingly, across the Continent, nuclear power, which=
=20
produces no CO2 emissions, has undergone a resurgence and presently generat=
es=20
an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and=20
Germany. =20

However, we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio=
ns=20
that took place during the Clinton administration. Most of the emissions=20
targets of the participating countries will be reached through=20
emission-trading mechanisms. Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows=20
industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price=
=20
commonly agreed. In other words, industrialized countries that do not meet=
=20
emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d=
o=20
better than required. This may encourage reductions to be made where they a=
re=20
most needed. However, critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to=
=20
loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting,=
=20
while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant=20
reductions.=20

Moreover, the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe=
an=20
Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of=
=20
emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse=
=20
gases. There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan=
d=20
and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol. Without U.S.=20
participation, the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large=
=20
industrialized country such as Japan decides to join. On his own, President=
=20
Bush now moves forward with constructing a plan for the United States that=
=20
attempts to balance the reduction of emissions while aggressively expanding=
=20
the country's generation supply. This will be a difficult balance to achiev=
e,=20
but the president remains confident that environmental protection and=20
industrial expansion do not need to be mutually exclusive.=20

Rick - 

I wasn't sure if you wanted to discuss 2000 budget in tomorrow's meeting but 
I wanted to give you some information on how the cost centers are doing as of 
the end of November:

Cost Center Number - Name - Owner	Year to Date Available
100042 - Enron Wash - Robertson	1,034,272.38
100059 - Fed Reg Affairs - Hartsoe	(40,965.92)
100062 - Dir Govt Affairs - Shapiro	4,427,058.18
100072 - ST G Aff-TX/OkAr - Ryall	(36,951.75)
100085 - St Gv Aff-Cal - Kaufman	(553.90)
100086 - St Gv Aff-Can - Dadson	239,757.92
100087 - St G Af-Md Atl - Montovano	(153,952.78)
100088 - St Gv Aff-MW - Migden	(107,315.96)
100100 - Gvt. Aff-Mex - Charvel	115,083.49
100108 - Reg Env/Implmnt - Steffes	84,032.05
TOTAL =	5,560,463.71

Beginning in January appropriate costs should be charged to the new cost 
centers for Sue Nord, Harry Kingerski and Lisa Yoho.  I'm working on putting 
together a variance report which I will forward to you for your review and 
comment.  With your permission I will work with Ginger to send out an e-mail 
to the assistants letting them know how things should be coded for 2001.  I 
assume that for 2001 the cost center owners will need to report monthly if 
they are over year to date.

Eric

Steve and Rick:  I attempted to strengthen the latest draft of the 
Stakeholder letter per your instructions on our most recent conference call.  
Unfortunately, we have pushed to the point that APPA, the consumer groups and 
most utilities will no longer sign the letter per their e-mail below.  It now 
looks like no letter will be sent.  If you would like, Enron, EPSA, ELCON and 
ACC only can send a revised stronger letter or alternatively, just bag the 
idea.  The utilities are split not wishing to let APPA appear more reliable 
then them.  I will forward the MidAmerican letter for your files which does 
support our position per my request.  I feel it is unfortunate that now APPA 
will send a strong support letter instead of signing our modified version.   
Per his request, I will meet with Congressman Wynn's Chief of Staff next week 
upon his return from vacation to discuss their strategy.   thanks.

Subject: Stakeholder Reliability Letter


While we have been actively involved in the editing process for a
stakeholder letter on reliability, I am writing to let you know of growing
concern among APPA's membership that the draft stakeholder reliability
letter still does not go far enough in representing our association's
position in support of stand-alone reliability legislation in the absence of
a comprehensive restructuring measure.  While we know the draft was intended
only to be kept in our "back pocket" for use if needed later in the session,
we would not be able to endorse sending the letter in any event unless it
was substantially strengthened to directly indicate support for a
stand-alone reliability measure.  Because it has become clear during the
editing process that the group cannot arrive at consensus on that point, we
would like to suggest that the group opt not to send such a letter, but
instead have our individual organizations write their own letters that more
accurately reflect their support or opposition on the question of
stand-alone reliability.  Thank you for your consideration.  Jane.

Caroline -- Thanks for your help.  I would like to get the ball rolling with 
Asia Partnership asap Tuesday morning.  Perhaps you and I could talk this 
afternoon so I can provide you with additional details regarding the 
parameters of the search.  I am in the Singapore office (numbers listed

Anthony,
I will be contacting Asia Partnership regarding Regulatory Recruiting for EBS 
in Singapore on Tuesday when they return from Easter holiday.  As I 
understand from Nick, you have two finalist candidates but would like to see 
if AP can produce anyone quickly for you.  Asia Partnership will most likely 
ask you for a retainer for this search (30 - 40% of total expected fee), but 
I will find out how soon they would expect to have candidates ready for 
interview before I tell them that we're 100% interested in moving forward.  
Lilian/Chor Lim, 
I'm going to hand this over to you to manage with Lucy Marshall of AP once I 
speak with her next week.  Lets plan on introduction via telephone Tuesday or 
Wednesday depending on how quickly they can produce for us.  I'm working to 
negotiate a preferred provider agreement, but have not yet managed to get any 
fee discounts.
Thanks,
Caroline

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to=

calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's=

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=

Andrea-

I received some additional information on your request for the status update 
of S. 764.

According to Sen. Feinstein's staff, S. 764 is with the Sen. Energy and 
Natural Resource Committee and is ready for mark-up.  The Committee is aware 
of the substance of the bill because the Senator already introduced bills 
S.26 and S.287 which both would direct the federal government to place "cost 
of service" based rates on electric energy in the western states.

Moreover, in the House of Representatives today, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held a mark-up of a bill, 
H.R. 1647, requiring FERC to establish a clearinghouse for the purchase of 
electric energy during electric emergencies.  Rep. Waxman (D-CA) offered Sen. 
Feinstein's language from S.764 as an amendment to H.R. 1647.  The amendment 
failed, but was eagerly watched by those in the government and industry.

Finally, it is my understanding that Senator Feinstein will be writing 
personally to all of the major natural gas and electric companies in 
California asking them to support the Williams position.

Please call with any questions.

Subject: Status of Discussions on Electricity Legislation -- No Agreement
 Reached

Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.

This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=
=20
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=
es=20
us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=
=20
done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=
=20
of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20
within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=
n=20
the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=
s=20
strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=

mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=
ed=20
to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=
=20
2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20
leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=

was a Congressional staffer and partner/principal in two Washington law fir=
ms=20
prior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=

to our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=

groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=

transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1s=
t=20
quarter of 2001 and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporti=

On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=

that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=
. =20
Joe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=

company that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=
=20
about this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=
ital=20
part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=
=20
over the next days and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=

that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=

strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=

=20
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20

In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=

EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20

This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services=20

over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi=

on=20
and report to Harry.
Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20

supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto Levy=
=20
will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also report =
to=20
Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job=
=20
in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business Rules) process over the=
=20
last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO=20
efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=
=20
wholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=

es=20
of the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=
=20
provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts=
=20
across North America.
Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=
g=20
the company=01,s efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be an=20
organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation=20
interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has recently=

Group

 TOP 10 PRIORITIES                                    1.  Alberta Power 
Purchase Agreements -  If Enron Canada is successful in the PPA auction, 
Enron Canada will have a very long position in the Alberta wholesale market; 
continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of  good transmission and 
distribution tariffs,  and development of rules for Plan "B" ( for those 
units that received no bids) will be 
critical.                                   2.  Continued support for  
ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in 
identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the 
later, work  with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re 
transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance 
opportunities for "Power by the Hour" and other distributed generation 
projects.)                              3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening 
- work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development 
of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the later, 
working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for 
interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial  
opportunities that exist.)                                  4. Enhancement of 
wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario.                              
5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada  in better understanding rules 
applicable   to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and 
Alberta.                     6. Alberta Natrural Gas 
Unbundling.                                  7. Renewed focus on potential 
for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the 
New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced  by a Liberal  
(pro-business) government in the province.                                
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE 
EFFECTIVE                                              1. Encourage 
government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to 
Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups 
in Houston. (In our case this would include Calgary).                         
      2. Replace or supplement the large group meetings with smaller 
meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can focus on issues of particular 
interest or enhance their understanding of a particular issue.  Seminars 
would be more in depth than what is possible in current group meeting format. 
                       3. Continue to enhance the information retrieval 
system so it  is easier to locate useful material (i.e. submissions, filings, 
etc.).                        4. Continue to emphasize to the commercial 
group  (at all levels) the value to Enron of  involving  government affairs 
in every major transaction  (value enhancing, risk mitigating) -  this should 
become the practice rather than the 
exception.

Here is a copy of the economists letter the Independent Institute released on 
health care.  It is about 330 words long.
  
http://independent.org/tii/news/OpenLetterHealthCare0002.html
 

Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps.  It is 
275 words long, so we have some room.



The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price 
regulation that is not present in other price control situations.  In other 
words, the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit, 
so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from 
economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly 
situation--at retail at least.

Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward 
real-time pricing.

Comments appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Rick

I was in Zurich on Friday and had an interesting discussion with Mauro 
Renggli - head of our office there. The discussion and
suggestions (below) were wholly at Mauro's instigation.

Over the past several months, Viviana has been tracking development in the 
Swiss market and providing updates etc. to Mauro and his 
team. He seems quite pleased with the work she is performing for him and has 
asked if I would be supportive of Viviana transferring to 
the Zurich office for 3+ months to work with his team. I told him I would 
think about it. From my perspective, this may be a very useful
step: 1) It allows her to get closer to a market she is already tracking for 
reg. affairs and which is headed for some important developments
ove the coming 6 months, 2) she is already a known and appreciated quantity 
there, and 3) most importantly, she would be able to 
work more closely with the small team there and perhaps get some of the 
additional support and guidance that I have not been able to 
provide.  Viviana has apprarently already voiced her interest in working in 
Switzerland.

Can you please call me before you speak to Viviana. Would welcome your take 
on this.

Thanks, Paul

As you can see below, the DWR deals are horrible for CA consumers.

Subject: DWR Stranded costs: $21 billion

I pulled the recent forward curves (confidential; not for external release 
without approval from West Power) and computed the stranded costs associated 
with the DWR contracts.  Assuming SP15 on peak (which is conservative since 
many of the contracts had off peak energy in them) the total overmarket is 
$21 billion, or $13 billion discounted at 12%.  The former number is most 
comparable to the $40+ billion DWR expenditure commitement number.

If we want to use this for any sort of external message I would like to 
refine further.

Alan

Steve, I attach a briefing paper for your visit. A hard copy will be 
available for you on arrival. The paper includes the following:
Itinerary
Conference details
Brattle paper summary
Media interview background
General key messages
Electricity wholesaling reactive statement
Political update
Meeting briefing notes




You will note one further change to the itinerary. We will be meeting with 
METI rather than the Fair Trade Commission. The purpose of the METI meeting 
will be to explain our concerns with the current regulatory environment and 
Enron Japan's proposal to temporarily suspend its electricity wholesaling 
activities. We met with our METI working level contacts today to brief them 
on Brattle and in particular the shortcomings of the current system. We did 
not discuss suspension of our wholesaling activities. The meeting briefing 
notes will be available on your arrival in Tokyo.


I also attach the latest version of the Brattle paper and, for completeness, 
the final version of the presentation and notes. 




I will call you at the Palace Hotel on Monday at 6pm. If you have any hiccups 
with arrangements please let me know. My contact numbers are as follows:

Home 813 52610539
Mobile 8190 27334795
Office 813 5219 4583

I think we have stirred things up enough here in the last couple of days to 
make for an interesting visit for you. I look forward to seeing you on Monday.

kind regards

Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on "a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform."  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Jim

The Commission issued a couple of orders in PJM last week:

PJM=01,s Load Response Program:  FERC approved implementation of two load=
=20
response pilot programs proposed by PJM which will be effective June 1, 200=
1=20
through May 31, 2002.  Under the first program, referred to as the =01&Emer=

Option,=018 a PJM member may sign up to be a participant in the program and=
 will=20
be paid the higher of the relevant zonal LMP or $500/MWh for the actual kWh=
=20
relief provided when the PJM member nominates load reduction in response to=
 a=20
request from PJM.  Under the second option, referred to as the =01&Economic=
=20
Option,=018 the PJM member will be able to reduce load in response to econo=
mic=20
signals, regardless of whether emergency conditions exist.  PJM will bill t=
he=20
LSE serving the end-use customer the LMP that would have been charged absen=
t=20
the reduction.  PJM will then refund to the LSE the retail generation and=
=20
transmission charges that the LSE would have received had the load not been=
=20
reduced.  The difference between the amount billed and refunded to the LSE=
=20
will be paid to the end-user.

Several customers opposed PJM=01,s programs, particularly the Economic Opti=
on. =20
However, FERC found that both programs allow end use customers to see price=
s=20
and respond to them when it is economically beneficial for them to do so. =
=20
FERC noted that because PJM's current market structure does not communicate=
=20
wholesale prices to retail customers in real time, they have no incentive t=
o=20
reduce demand when prices increase.  FERC finds that PJM's plan will, in=20
part, fix this flaw in its market structure.  PJM is required to file a=20
report with FERC by the end of the year evaluating the effectiveness of the=
=20
program.

Changes to PJM's Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA):  FERC also approved=
=20
PJM's proposed changes to its RAA, effective June 1.  PJM had requested FER=
C=20
authorization to change the RAA by i) adjusting the time period over which =
an=20
LSE must commit generation resources to PJM to meet its capacity obligation=
s=20
under the RAA, from a daily to a seasonal commitment; ii) adjusting the=20
deficiency charge provisions to provide for a seasonal, rather than a daily=
,=20
penalty for LSEs; and iii) requiring generation owners to commit excess=20
capacity to PJM seasonally, rather than daily, in order to participate in a=
ny=20
distribution of revenues from capacity deficiency charges paid by LSEs.  EP=
MI=20
supported PJM's changes, stating that although the ICAP requirement should =
be=20
eliminated entirely, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction=
=20
in resolving the delisting problem.

In approving the changes, FERC stated that moving from daily to seasonal=20
deficiency charges discourages generators from delisting capacity during th=
e=20
summer and gives LSEs the incentive to meet their capacity obligations,=20
thereby helping PJM to meet its short-term and long-term reliability goals.=
 =20
FERC also said that PJM's Market Monitoring Unit will be able to monitor=20
generator gaming behavior and take appropriate action if necessary.

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that 
puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the 
CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, 
until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in 
Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have 
agreed with the new timetable.

Here is a brief synopsis of my view of LDC gas hedging, which I just chewed 
Harry's ear off explaining:

1.  Commission needs to understand how hedging works.  In a typical market 
situation, the supplier of a good negotiates with the consumer, who can 
explain to the supplier what his appetite for risk and term is, and then the 
supplier can come up with the appropriate pricing and term (eg. all spot, 
fixed price, pricing within a band). In other words, the hedge reflects the 
customer's specific wants and needs.

2.  When a utility tries to hedge for its amorphous group of bundled sales 
customers, it lacks the specific knowledge of  the appetite for risk that 
group has, and in fact, the appetites will be all over the place.  Therefore, 
the hedging will not be perfect.  If a utility locks in some pricing at term, 
there is always the risk that a hindsight regulatory review will find that 
the price was too high in light of later market developments, or that too 
much reliance was placed on spot, which may have moved up.  What utilities 
need then, is the guidance to hedge, and then freedom from hindsight review.  
(This gives ENA a good market for its hedged products and removes regulatory 
risk involved with those products.)

3.  When the utility hedges, it faces potential stranded costs, which arise 
if load leaves.  Thus, to mitigate the potential and size of this problem, 
the hedged portfolio should only be dedicated to those customers for whom 
leaving for transportation is not a real option (residential and small 
commercial).  If larger customers are on sales service, their rates should 
reflect market index prices, as they do have the ability to leave, and spot 
pricing removes the stranded cost and undercollection concerns.  (It also 
gives us something easy to market against).  In other words, we need 2 PGA's, 
one for captive customers and one for non-captive customers.

4.  To make this 2-part world work, there must be in place an effective 
transportation program that enables larger customers to shop for their own 
supplies in the competitive market.

Sue, I will be in Houston Tues afternoon and Wed. if you want to meet to 
discuss.

The PUCT ruled today that the utilities' excess earnings balance will be 
credited to the wires...amortized over 7 years with 7.5% interest beginning 
Jan 1, 2002.  (Trueup was not until 2004).  Utilities are unhappy however, 
this is the direction the commission had indicated they were heading a few 
weeks ago.  The excess earnings total over $6 billion dollars (new numbers 
came out today).  

I visited with Rep. Turner today after the commission's ruling, AECT set up a 
meeting with him to cut a deal.  Our commitment with Turner is that he will 
not harm the headroom created in SB 7 and subsequent PUCT decisions.  Turner 
was not completely happy with the commission's order because he was hoping 
for a larger refund check to rate payers.  Our amendment to HB 2107 (which 
refunds the excess earnings to the wires) is in line with the commission's 
decision.  When we signed on board with Turner, he said that if we stood with 
him, he would protect our interest.  Thank you for letting us get on board 
with him.  The IOUs are trying to cut a deal with him and because we stood 
with him...our interest should come first (as he has stated). 

During the HB 2107 committee hearing in March, Baker (TXU)  indicated that 
excess earnings should be returned to the wires (in 2004 trueup).  (I am 
getting the transcript of that hearing in the morning to confirm my memory).  

In a hearing on Nov 8, 2000 at the PUCT, Shaeffer ( Reliant) testified "We 
believe that if we overrecover stranded investment, that we're going to 
refund the dollars down to the book value".  Of course he meant during the 
2004 trueup, however, with the overcollection reaching $6 billion - and with 
today's commission ruling - a refund of the overcollection before 2004 is 
inevitable.  

Chairman Wolens (off the record) indicated today that HB 2107 would go to 
conference.  I think it is safe to infer he thinks the bill will pass the 
House and move to the Senate.  Turner has worked the Black Caucus, Hispanic 
Caucus and the Democratic Caucus.  

Rep. Counts (West Texas Conservative D) stood with Turner at the press 
conference along with Rep. Bailey and Rep. Hodge...each of them advocated for 
a refund of the overcollection.  (At the press conference Turner stated that 
he would drop his bill and wait until the 2004 trueup if the utilities would 
agree to keep everyone's lights on until the 2004 trueup.) The bill is likely 
to be heard on the House floor next Tuesday.

I did not provide comments/quotes to Fort Worth Star Telegram...they were 
told I was at the Capitol at a hearing.  I am working on a formal statement 
and gathering the support of other market participants with our interest to 
sign on.  I will run that by you before anything goes out. 

Thus far, Enron, Calpine, New Energy, Strategic,  and Excelon are willing to 
publically support our amendment to HB 2107.  (Others are supporting it but 
won't come out of the closet because they fear the utilities.) We are talking 
to Shell on Friday.  (They got confused and are supporting the bill as 
filed...which hurts headroom...they like our amendment but want to talk 
Friday before supporting it.)  

Thanks for your help with this, Jean

Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating 
an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of 
electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is 
requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states 
that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our 
offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make 
sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will 
get back to you asap with further information.

the market has fallen and is still falling precipitously.  for example, power 
for tomorrow is trading for about $70/MWh on peak and $25/MWh off-peak.  
implementing price caps now would actually be harmful.  peaking units make no 
money.  we are likely to return to a more normal market, particularly after 
the summer, if we aren't there already.  with the forward curve crashing the 
way it is and price caps it makes no sense to build peakers.  what are the 
odds of a balance of the year price cap?

Tim --

What are your current thoughts on wholesale hard price caps for the entire 
West?  

First, the politics are clearly moving toward some compromise with the 
Democrat takeover in the Senate and the "at-risk" Republicans in the House 
(California delegation).  I think that the Administration is struggling for 
some "solution".

Second, given FERC's order, it appears that for many hours caps are already 
in place.

Third, with market prices moving lower, this may want be a non-event.

Finally, I would think that a region-wide solution is simple to understand 
and administer.

Please let me know your thoughts.  I don't know that Enron would ever 
publically endorse such a proposal, but we may signal that we aren't opposed?

Jim

Midterm Jitters in the House 
By David S. Broder

Wednesday, May 16, 2001; Page A23 
President Bush may not be a scholar, but he is an avid student of politics. 
For understandable reasons, he has given especially close scrutiny to the 
lessons of his father's presidency -- and what went wrong to deny him a 
second term in 1992.
The results can be seen in the current chief executive's adamant support of 
the large tax cut on which he campaigned; he knows that his dad's retreat 
from his "no new taxes" pledge cost him vital conservative support. The 
younger Bush is also the opposite of the elder in emphasizing education. Bush 
I did little or nothing to change the schools; Bush II put them at the top of 
his agenda, just as the voters persistently do.
But the most costly error -- in political terms -- that Bush I made was 
refusing to consider any short-term fixes for the economic slump that began 
in the third year of his presidency. When the jobless rate began to edge up, 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady counseled Bush against any stimulus 
measures, saying that market forces would be enough by themselves to keep the 
recession short.
Brady's advice brought no comfort to the Republican politicians on Capitol 
Hill, who were picking up bad vibes from their constituents. Vice President 
Dan Quayle, who was on the GOP fundraising circuit in 1991, expressed his 
frustration that Brady was blocking even modest short-term measures. History 
has recorded that Brady was right. The recession was short, and recovery -- 
as measured by the statisticians -- actually began before the 1992 election. 
But that did not spare the incumbent president from charges of indifference 
to persisting unemployment, and Bill Clinton was elected on a promise to pep 
up the economy.
The current Bush has accepted congressional changes in his tax plan that will 
apply short-term stimulus to a sluggish economy. But on the energy problems 
that began on the West Coast and have swept across the country, Bush II is as 
scornful of short-term fixes as his father was a decade ago.
This week the administration is releasing its energy plan -- crafted by a 
task force under Vice President Dick Cheney -- in an atmosphere of growing 
crisis. Even before summer has arrived, California is experiencing rolling 
blackouts. Oregon and Washington have sacrificed the salmon runs to save 
river water for hydroelectric power. Midwest gasoline prices have surged past 
$2 a gallon. And natural gas prices are sky-high everywhere.
When I spent a weekend at Rocky Mountain College in Montana earlier this 
month, I was astonished to learn that even in that energy-exporting state, 
the first phase of deregulation has sent prices soaring and made energy the 
hottest issue.
In the face of all this, Cheney and Bush have refused to consider temporary 
price caps on electric power or any other short-term "fix" that violates 
free-market principles. The complex of production incentives and conservation 
measures that make up the energy strategy is designed to bring supply and 
demand into balance over the next several years, not to provide immediate 
relief.
That may be sound economics, but it leaves congressional Republicans as 
nervous as their counterparts were 10 years ago. Rep. Tom Davis, the able 
Virginian who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, told me 
last week that he is hearing more worries from his colleagues about energy 
prices than about the overall economy.
"We can stand one bad summer," Davis said, "but if we're facing the same 
thing next summer, we've got problems."
Davis said he had communicated his party's concerns to the White House. "Do 
they get the message?" I asked.
"No," he said. "They think in four-year terms; we think in two."
That comment reflects a reality that few politicians are as candid as Davis 
in acknowledging. Much as the members of one party's congressional wing may 
hope for a president of their own party, who will sign the bills they pass 
and help them raise money for their own campaigns, owning the White House 
creates dilemmas.
The basic political strategy is always set by the president's people, and 
naturally enough, they think about creating favorable conditions for the year 
in which he will run for reelection. They can be more patient, and more 
oblivious to short-term problems, than those who are focused on the battle 
for the House and Senate.
Republicans like Tom Davis remember that eight years ago, when the Democrats 
controlled both the White House and Congress, it was Clinton's policy 
decisions on taxes, trade, guns and health care that left his party so 
vulnerable that Democrats lost both the House and Senate in 1994. That's the 
risk Republicans are facing now. And that's why they're nervous.

More Than California's Problem 
By Gray Davis

Wednesday, May 16, 2001; Page A23 
SACRAMENTO -- As President Bush this week rolls out his new energy policy, I 
once again urge him to confront the energy elephant in the middle of the room 
-- the out-of-control wholesale prices of electricity in California and 
across the West.
In 1996, California ventured headlong into a flawed scheme to deregulate 
electricity. Although Californians were promised lower rates and plentiful 
supply, both predictions have turned out to be disastrously wrong. We have 
now seen our first statewide rolling blackouts since World War II. Unheard-of 
wholesale prices for power have bankrupted our largest utility, threaten to 
bankrupt the second largest and have begun to seriously affect our economy. 
If we don't get the situation under control, it could quickly threaten our 
national economy.
California bears some fault for the current situation. In addition to the 
botched deregulation plan, centermost was our failure for the 12 years before 
I took office to build any major power plants. But my administration has 
moved quickly to remedy that by streamlining the permitting process for 
generating facilities. In the past two years, my energy commission has 
licensed 14 new major power plants, nine are under construction, and four 
will be on line this summer or fall. Nearly a dozen more are in the pipeline. 
In addition, we've approved six new "peaker" plants to meet this summer's 
demand. We're moving at unprecedented speed to deal with the supply problem.
The state, however, has absolutely no jurisdiction over the wholesale prices 
being charged by the unregulated, mostly out-of-state generators that 
purchased the utilities' power plants as part of deregulation. Since the 
Federal Power Act was passed in 1935, price regulation has been the exclusive 
domain of the federal government. But the Bush administration and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission have consistently refused to carry out their 
statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are "just and reasonable."
To the contrary, the free-market ideologues in the administration argue that 
uncontrolled market prices are needed in order to increase the supply of 
electricity. In other words, if we don't allow power generators to shoot the 
moon on prices, they won't have sufficient incentive to build additional 
supply. That's as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies $300 a gallon 
to motivate them to produce milk. In fact, I have joined my fellow governors 
in Oregon and Washington in proposing temporary cost-based pricing that would 
still allow generators and marketers a healthy profit -- but without 
bankrupting the system.
Last week, however, Vice President Dick Cheney told the Los Angeles Times 
that he would remain philosophically opposed to any federal intervention on 
wholesale power prices even if it threatened the national economy. With all 
due respect to the vice president, that is one of the most irresponsible 
statements I've ever heard. Here is the eye-popping result of the federal 
government's rigid stance: In the spring of 2000, a megawatt of electricity 
in California cost an average of $30. By last December, after the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission precipitously removed the hard price cap of $250 
per megawatt hour that been in effect, the spot-market price shot up to 
$1,500 for the same megawatt of power. Just last week, we paid an astounding 
per-megawatt record of $1,900 to Houston-based Reliant Energy for the last 
100 megawatts of power we needed to keep the lights on.
The macro result of this unconscionable price gouging is predictable -- and 
scary. In 1999, California power users paid approximately $7 billion for all 
electricity consumed. Last year, that figure shot up to $27 billion. This 
year, estimates are that total spending on electrical power may hit $50 
billion to $60 billion.
The California Independent System Operator, the state's electric grid 
manager, has estimated in a report to the federal energy commission that 
electricity overcharges during the past year have totaled more than $6 
billion. Even the federal commission itself has formally ruled that the 
electricity market in California is dysfunctional and that prices charged 
have been unjust and unreasonable.
Where is that money going? Simply put, into the pockets of the generators and 
marketers -- almost all of them in the South and many of them located in 
Texas. It is one of the most massive transfers of wealth from the consumers 
of one state to companies located in another region of the country in our 
nation's history. But other than ordering a pittance in limited refunds -- 
none of which has yet been returned to the state -- the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission has stood fast in its opposition to real price caps.
The day before President Bush was sworn in, he stated on national television 
that the energy problem here was California's to solve. Well, we are moving 
aggressively to do our part to get it under control on both the generation 
and conservation fronts. But without just and reasonable prices for wholesale 
power, the crisis inevitably will spill over and damage the already-sluggish 
national economy.
That, Mr. President, not only will be your problem, it will affect every one 
of us. Californians are demanding action. We are doing our part, leading the 
nation in building power plants and in aggressive conservation. The federal 
government must do its part to temporarily control runaway energy prices in 
the West until we can bring on line the major new power plants California has 
approved.

EWI: Early Warning Information

DE PALACIO BACKS CONSTANT COAL PRODUCTION
European Energy and Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio has confirmed
her commitment to creating a basic level of fossil fuel production
(including coal) to help guarantee security of supplies in Europe. Mrs de
Palacio is current preparing a legislative proposal with a view planning
coal production after the ECSC Treaty expires, in July 2002. She said "coal
continues to be one of the main sources of energy and remains at the centre
of our concerns. As well as being one of the native resources coal also
contributes to regional cohesion.". Coal subsidies are due to be phased out
by 2010, when all countries are supposed achieve a drastic cut in their
greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Kyoto Protocol provisions. "
However, it is vital to have more than a strategic reserve, which mean a
proportion of the infrastructure, the professional skills and the techno
-logical experience," she stressed. In the coming weeks she plans to table a
proposal to create a basic level of subsidised primary energies, comprising
coal and renewable sources of energy: "the aim is to strengthen the security
of supply situation in Europe " she explained, adding that "its use has to
be in keeping with environmental protection considerations ". She
underscored the importance of research and technological development for
promo-ting less environmentally hostile production activities.

Public Hearing on Revised Energy Law (EnWG Novelle)
- the German Parliment voted for a open hearing in conjunction with 
deliberations over the revision to the Energy Law. We had
been pushing hard for such a hearing so as to be able to get EFET and other 
like-minded associations to voice our
concerns about the lack of real market opening in the gas and power markets. 
The hearing is now scheduled for th 24th
of Sept and I will probably speak on behalf of EFET Germany.

Possible Application of Article 86 by EU Commission to Force Greater/More 
Rapid Market Opening
- Tensions between Germany and the EU on lack of  implementation of the Gas 
Directive and German instransigence on
regulated TPA and cross-border issues continues to build. Indeed, the 
atmosphere is quite tense now and it seems likely
that the EU will no employ the "nuclear option" of Article 86 to force 
greater and more rapid market opening in member
states. (Peter can add to this)

Gas VV Negotiations Difficult: German Cartel Office Sends Highly Critical 
Letter to Associations
- The negotiations of amendments to the German Gas network agreement continue 
to move at a snail's pace.Key issues
that we have argued for (cost-based tarriffs, development of standard 
transport and storage contracts, replacement of 
point-to-point tariff model with an exit/entry system) have yet to be 
addressed -largely because the gas industry is
wholly opposed to making these part of the negotiations. The negotiating 
associations to the network agreement (so-called 
VV-Gas) have been criticized in a letter from the head of the German Cartel 
Office. He concludes that there efforts have
not produced a basis for gas competition in Germany and that if significant 
progress is not made in the next few months, 
the Cartel Office does not see how Germany can continue to defend the model 
of negotiated access and may have
to accept a regulated solution.

Negotiation Begin for Access to Baltic Cable
After many months of correspondence and insistence by Philip Davies that 
Baltic Cable provide us with terms for
TPA, the new managment of Baltic Cable has agreed to meet with us to 
negotiate access. Negotiations will begin
with Eon (now manager of Baltic) on the 11th.

OMV/Tag Finco
Some weeks ago we initiated a formal proceeding against the Austrian pipeline 
company for effective denial of access
to their long-distance pipe running to Italy. After several hours of 
hearings, the Ministry accepted Enron's complaint and 
rejected OMV's petition to withdraw the complaint. The Ministry provided 
clear indications to OMV that they would
prefer a negotiated settlement but were ready to proceed with a full-scale 
investigation if necessary. The pressure
was sufficient to bring OMV to the table and we are now in the process of 
trying to reach closure of firm capacity
through Austria and into Italy.Should we fail to conclude agreement by July 
15th, the case against OMV will
resume.

Title: The Battle of the Destination Clauses
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2378

EUROPEAN GAS REPORT-THE BATTLE OF THE DESTINATION CLAUSES
The next round in the long war over competition in European gas is being 
fought
on a new battleground-destination clauses that sit within (or alongside) many
long-term contracts for gas supply in Europe. The Directorate General for
Competition of the European Commission (DG COMP) recently said it has been
investigating several long-term take-or-pay contracts for over a year to make
sure that destination clauses fall in line with European Union (EU) 
competition
laws.

* The abolition of territorial restriction clauses would be a prelude to more
widespread renegotiation of long-term take-or-pay contracts and would bring
genuine competition in European gas markets.

* In parallel with the pressure from the competition authorities, new
commercial opportunities appear to be opening up, notably in the 
Mediterranean,
bringing further pressure to bear on the destination clauses.

Rick:

I guess you will have been reasonably pleased with the Commissions July 12th
Orders on the RTOs. It seems to be going down the same basic road we have
been discussing.

I guess there will now be a relatively short process to outline each of the
proposed mega-RTOs. While the Northeast RTO is most pinned down, the others
seem well up in the air. The Southeast RTO in particular seems to be
flailing a bit.

If you or any of your folks were keen I am very interested in the SE RTO and
Western RTO in particular. As they move beyond the usual groups of utility
guys sitting around a table it might be a good time to throw some economic
reality into the picture. Could be method for presenting some of the
thinking of the policy paper to the world?

Hope you had a good trip to London. Heard it has been very warm over there
(although not of course by Houston standards...)

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and
Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.
Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start
of the August Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both
Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to
electricity issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the
subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all
electricity issues other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly
held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and
off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate
side, the majority staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that
may be circulated for comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1.   Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by
Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo
(D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and
essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2.   First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan
basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman
amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other
than generation added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to
offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not
supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering
basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only"
bill.)

3.   The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the
Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation
facility" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places
until FERC has abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some
instances of "old" pipelines being considered as "historic places" under
federal law.  The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to
its package yesterday.

4.   By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require
the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse
gases down to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many
Republicans and Democrats to this amendment.

5.   By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment
to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50
percent).

FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go 
figure.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: ComEd Rate case - CONFIDENTIAL


FYI - As you may have heard, ComEd has filed to raise T&D rates about 37% 
(about $5.5/MWh).  If they are granted the full increase in rates, our 
existing position will undoubtedly take a hit.  There are 3 potential but 
independent effects on our book...

Primary Effect - Assuming all customers have zero CTC, if T&D rates go up 
$5.5/MWh on average and we have 8.5million MWh so -$47m hit to the book.  
However, we do have customers with positive CTCs that should offset some of 
this increase and true impact would likely be around -$12m. Remember this 
assumes ComEd get's the full $5.5/MWh increase they're asking for. 

Secondary Effect - Assume we still cannot deliver physically in IL.  With 
higher distribution rates customers are now more likely to get kicked off PPO 
(bc CTC=0) and we're returning them to bundled rates (Illinois State Univ. 
problem).  The impact would be about -$21m  [($71 - $76)/MWh * 4.2m MWh = 
-$21] if everyone's returned to BBR and we do not deliver.  The formula above 
is [(Avg price Customers are paying us - Avg BBR price)*(MWhs for 2005-2010)].

Tertiary Effect - We figure setup a desk to physically deliver and our 
delivery service rates are now higher.  We're back to the Primary effect.  
However, if we can beat the generation prices embedded in PPO we're likely to 
offset that -$12m.

These are not additive effects and should not be summed.  They are worst-case 
scenarios under various states of the world.  Also they are rough estimates.  
Finally, remember that no book impacts will be made until we understand which 
states of the will take place after the final order in April 2002.

I'm working closely with Janine Migden, Roy Boston, Guy Sharfman, and Harry 
Kingerski to identify which areas Enron will address in the rate case.  

Please do not share this information freely.  We are trying to negotiate with 
ComEd for wholesale energy and services and this information could 
tremendously hurt our negotiating position.

Please feel free to ask me questions on anything.

I bring this Minnesota bill to your attention thinking that it may be one  
state that we can point to as moving forward rather than backward as a 
response to California.  This bill would absolutely not have moved if 
California had not been on the radar screen--for the first time in four 
years, the leadership insisted that the caucuses move something out of 
committee on energy.

WHile customer choice did not ultimately survive (it got knocked out towards 
the end of the committee votes), there was a general agreement by committee 
members that MN had to prepare for retail access, but that they needed to get 
the wholesale market in better shape in preparation.

By the way, the enviromental community was very very confident that they were 
going to get a mandate for a 10% renewable portfolio standard by 2015, and 
they were then going to make Minnesota the poster child to promote mandated 
RPS across the country.  Their mandate turned into "goals" to be met by 
utilities, and they are not happy.

		 Subject: Minnesota Energy Legislation

Earlier this week the Minnesota legislature passed an omnibus energy bill--SF 
#722.  The Governor is expected to sign the bill.  Much of the bill focused 
on increasing conservation, helping low income customers, setting goals for 
renewable energy development, setting up reliability standards (the unions 
had to get something!) etc.  However, there are also some sections that may 
be commercially beneficial to us.

The bill streamlines the process for transmission siting, and to a small 
degree, makes generation siting a bit easier.  Interconnection standards and 
rules for distributed generation (defined as up to 10MW) are required and the 
process will begin late this summer.  The munis and coops had a section on 
"joint finance" that will allow them to enter into projects with other 
parties--this should make it easier for them to do business with us.  
Minnesota has approx 120 municipal utilities and over 40 co ops. 

There is still outstanding an issue of a personal property tax exemption for 
merchant plants.  That provision was transfered to the overall tax bill, 
which is still being debated.  We should have a conclusion on the tax bill 
late next week. 

Please call if you have any questions or would like further info.

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

In yesterday's prepared testimony before Barton's subcommittee, Chairman 
Hebert stated:  "Finally, I emphasize that the Commission's open access 
program for natural gas transportation has resulted in a vibrant, 
transparent, liquid competitive market for natural gas.  It is critical that 
we continue to develop the same type of competitive, comparable markets for 
electric energy and transmission as well, and to do so as expeditiously as 
possible."

If still ok, I think that we should try and establish the date for the

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

The blackouts will occur in the Southeast, Central-West and Northeast regio=
ns
of the country. At the same time the government will introduce a program=20
providing
incentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is=
=20
to lower
electricity consumption by 20%.
Although the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t=
he
details have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government
ministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new
meeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem=
ent
will have been reached on how to implement the plan.
The initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for
industry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The
ministries of finance, planning and development, however, asked for more ti=
me=20
to
consider the impact of the energy cuts.
The principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the
economy of the proposed blackouts. According to a study to be released toda=
y=20
by
the Get?lio Vargas Foundation, a 20% energy cut would slow economic growth =
by
1.5% of gross domestic product and would have a direct impact on 850,000 jo=
bs.
Production costs for industry would rise 1.5%, government tax receipts woul=
d
decline by R$6.6 billion (US$2.9 billion) and Brazil=01,s trade deficit wou=
ld=20
increase
by US$1.6 billion, according to the study. The study=01,s authors also said=
=20
there was
no guarantee that the effects of the program would be limited to this year.
Business leaders reacted with apprehension to the prospect of obligatory
blackouts. Most defended a policy of separate reduction goals for each=20
industrial
sector, sparing industries that depend heavily on electricity. The S?o Paul=
o=20
State
Federation of Industries (Fiesp) said that sectors who are major consumers =
of
energy such as steel should be exempted from any rationing.
While details were lacking in the government=01,s plan, officials said that=
 the
administration of the energy cuts would be placed in the hands of local=20
utilities
which would determine the locations and schedules for daily blackouts.=20
According
to national energy secretary Afonso Henriques, a 20% reduction in consumpti=
on
would amount to a cut of six hours a day.

Sergio:

Attached are a few documents that set out Enron's position on governance 
issues.  Each document is somewhat case specific (eg. GridFlorida focuses on 
the governance problems in  Florida, etc) but you will see our general 
position from each document.  As you will see in the GridFlorida pleading, we 
urge FERC to order Florida to implement a governance structure similar to 
that in PJM, which has worked quite well over the past couple of years.  In 
the California White Paper, we focus on the problems with the stakeholder 
board which has since been disbanded and replaced with a board chosen by the 
California government.  In the last California protest, we focus on the 
problems with the California government putting in their own board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need other documents.

Sarah



GridFlorida Final:



White paper filed in California, prepared by Frontier Economics and Tabors 
Caramanis.  See page 32, section 5, which discusses governance issues.



California pleading regarding the recent changes in the California ISO's 
board of directors.

addressing the appropriate methodologies to arrive at the dollar value for 
your work/accomplishment.  I promise that you--each for her/his 
accomplishments --shall be personally involved in determining the appropriate 
methodology so that to reflect your work in the most accurate manner.  
Accordingly, I would appreciate very much that all your accomplishments 
should reach me as soon as possible so that to allocate as much time for 
methodology and communication with you.  A report is currently being prepared 
of the compiled methodologies submitted so far and I shall send it you with 
the hope that it will be of help.

I also want to communicate that the process of sending your accomplishments 
is not really voluntary;  it is PRC related.  Therefore, I am really seeking 
your help and support to complete this task.  Perhaps the head of the Teams 
would like to ensure with the colleagues that all accomplishments are 
accounted for.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question or I can be of any

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? Senator Keeley Spearheads a New "Plan B"
? State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective "Plan B"
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed 
out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan "as 
soon as possible"; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not 
this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans 
were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they 
developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  
However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough 
Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much 
tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will 
be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people 
who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.  
Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez "Plan B's," Keeley's new 
plan is said to:
? Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their 
undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to "high-end 
customers."  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who 
would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate 
component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 
12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component 
for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that 
will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional 
dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to 
cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward 
purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation 
should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key 
question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of 
power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to 
continue operating.
? The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission 
assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan 
would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on 
the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an 
incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it 
would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the 
value would be credited toward the loan.
? In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the 
filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power 
generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to 
pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct 
access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the 
constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go 
forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that 
the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.  
Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission 
assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would 
become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding "Plan B" and the 
legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering 
Keeley's "Plan B" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the 
Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of 
bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking 
seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans 
remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of 
PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain).

Publisher's Note
================
The EU Member States may disagree about exactly when they will able
to let in the new members from Eastern and Central Europe. But
preparations for their accession continue apace.

The EU's Council of Ministers this week gave the Commission the go-
ahead to negotiate 'framework agreements' with Cyprus, Malta and
Turkey for their early participation in programmes such as the EU's
R&D Programme and education and vocational training programmes. They
will also be able to take part in all the programmes already open to
the candidate countries of central/eastern Europe.

Early participation in EU programmes forms an important part of a pre-
accession strategy already used for central and eastern European
candidates. It provides useful preparation for accession by
familiarising the candidate countries and their citizens with Union
policies and working methods.

1. Agreement reached over EU takeover directive
-----------------------------------------------
The EU has finally agreed the contents of the Takeover Directive
after 12 years of negotiation. The Conciliation deal between the
European Parliament and the Council would force company boards to
inform minority shareholders and workers of their recommendations on
a takeover offer at the same time as the majority shareholders.
Governments would have until 2005 to pass the legislation but with an
extra year's grace to pass a ban on 'poison pill' defences.

2. Irish vote on EU Treaty referendum
-------------------------------------
On Thursday, Ireland became the first and only country to ask its
people to vote on proposals to enlarge the EU. The result of the
referendum on whether to ratify the Nice Treaty was expected by late
afternoon on Friday.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/49075


3. EIB signals greater focus on Eastern Europe, research
--------------------------------------------------------
The European Investment Bank, at its annual meeting in Luxembourg,
signalled the Bank's aim of limiting growth of its lending within the
EU member countries in order to give more room for activities in the
candidate countries. The Bank has also called for a capital increase
in 2003.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/49087
The EIB and the Commission this week also signed a memorandum for
closer co-operation in the funding of European research.

4. EU warns Germany over gas liberalisation
-------------------------------------------
The Commission has sent a written warning to Germany for failing to
open the gas market to competition as required under EU rules. All 15
Member States should have implemented the gas liberalisation
directive by August 10 last year.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/48959


5. Turkey mulls adopting euro before EU membership: report
----------------------------------------------------------
Turkey could adopt the euro unilaterally before joining the EU,
Economy Minister Kemal Dervis was quoted as saying by the Financial
Times on Monday. Dervis said the move would be possible in five years
if Turkey managed to achieve low inflation - currently at 60 per
cent - and fulfilled other EU membership criteria, the paper said.

6. Commission sets out strategy to combat Net security threats
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Commission has set out in a Communication its strategy to tackle
increasing security threats to the use of the Internet with a series
of policy recommendations to make it safer to use for individuals and

'How can these people talk "making the EU the most competitive
economy in the world by 2010 and the Commission claims that increased
tax co-ordination would help countries meet these objectives"... are
these not effectively the same people who, for example, ever campaign
to extend the same work practices that restrict the rights of
employers (and willing employees) to demand longer working hours etc.
etc ... or have I completely missed the boat here perhaps? Tweaking
tax and cross border issues alone will not bring make this commercial
dream happen ... We compete with completely deregulated markets ...

I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals 
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale 
electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, 
resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool 
Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in 
the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional 
opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron 
Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the 
United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also 
played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in 
helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the 
delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned 
utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's 
competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced 
considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob 
has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial 
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition 
last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value 
embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of 
both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity 
industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously 
during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that 
retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in 
California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging 
state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights 
tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in 
California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their 
significant accomplishments.

Subject: FACT SHEET: 21ST CENTURY CONSERVATION

                    21st Century Energy Conservation:
    "Pushing conservation forward will require investment in new energy
 technology.  And that will be a part of my Administration?s energy plan."
                  President George W. Bush, May 12, 2001

Next week the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD), chaired by
Vice-President Cheney, will make its policy recommendations to the
President.  Provided below are a few of the NEPD's recommendations to
promote 21st Century energy conservation.

Expand Combined Heat and Power Projects:
Because of their large needs for both heat and electricity, businesses find
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems particularly attractive. However,
replacing old, inefficient boilers with highly efficient CHP systems can
add a number of new regulatory requirements (such as air permits), without
offering the same depreciation incentives the tax code grants to power
plants.

Recommendations:
1.   Direct the Secretary of Treasury to work with the Secretary of Energy
and Congress to encourage increased energy efficiency through combined heat
and power projects by shortening the tax depreciation life for CHP projects
to 7 years.

2.   Direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to
work with local and state governments to encourage the use of well-designed
CHP and other clean power generation at brownfields sites, consistent with
the local communities? interests. EPA will also work to clarify liability
issues if they are raised at a particular site.

3.   Direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to
promote combined heat and power through flexibility in environmental
permitting to the extent permitted by law.

Provide Incentives for Hybrid / Fuel Cell Vehicles
Hybrid vehicles use power electronics and battery storage to get more out
of every gallon of gasoline consumed, and provide the ability to double
vehicle mileage.

A recent National Energy Laboratory Report indicates that the fuel economy
of a typical automobile could be enhanced by 60 percent by increasing
engine and transmission efficiency and reducing vehicle mass by about 15
percent. Several promising efficiency technologies are being presented to
the U.S. market. Automobile manufacturers are developing and have already
introduced hybrid vehicles. Advanced lightweight materials offer up to 6
percent improvement in mileage for each 10 percent reduction in body
weight.

Recommendation:  Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to work with Congress
to provide an individual, temporary, efficiency-based income tax credit be
available for purchase of new hybrid (gasoline/electric) or fuel cell
vehicles between 2002 and 2007.



Expand the Consumer Energy Efficiency Programs:
The Federal government not only ensures consumers have information on the
energy efficiency of major home appliances, it also promotes the most
energy efficient products in office buildings through the Energy Star
program, a joint program run by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the EPA.
Energy Star is awarded only to appliances that significantly exceed minimum
energy efficiency standards. The Energy Star program does not extend to all
products.  Energy efficiency would be further promoted if the Energy Star
program were expanded to a broader range of products.

Recommendations:

1.  Direct the Secretary of Energy to promote greater energy efficiency of
appliances and buildings.  Specifically,

    a. Expand the Energy Star program beyond office buildings to include
    schools, retail buildings, health care facilities, and homes;

    b. Extend the Energy Star labeling program to additional products,
    appliances and services; and

    c. Strengthen DOE public education programs relating to energy
    efficiency.

2.  Direct the Administrator of the EPA to develop and implement a strategy
to increase public awareness of the sizeable savings that energy efficiency
offers to homeowners.  The typical homeowner can save about 30 percent
(about $400) a year on their home energy bill by using Energy Star labeled
products such as computers, air conditioners and other products.

It's bad, and it'll get worse/TROUBLE AHEAD: Extra power for summer will fall 
well short of Gov. Davis' promise
Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer


   California will get only one-third of the new power that Gov. Gray Davis
promised to deliver by July 1, virtually ensuring a brutal summer of
blackouts for the energy-strapped state.
   Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get 5,000 extra megawatts
up and running by summer. Instead, the state will have 1,698 megawatts of
the promised new power by July 1, according to the California Energy
Commission. Even by Sept. 1, California will have added just 3,669
megawatts.
   The goal of 5,000 megawatts -- enough to power 5 million homes -- was
crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand
this summer.
   "We're still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as
possible," said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. "But we understand there
are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants."
   In fact, experts said, there are so many obstacles that the governor's
plan was unrealistic to begin with.
   "There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish," said Arthur
O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets
newsletter.
   Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand, California can
expect a long, dark summer.
   "Any warm day from May to October -- it doesn't even have to be abnormally
warm -- California is going to be at risk for blackouts," said Michael
Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy and
economics consulting firm based in California.
   He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be "in
the hundreds of hours. I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of
them pretty quickly."
   The California Independent System Operator, which oversees about 85
percent of the state's straining grid, has said that anytime its load hits
40,000 megawatts or above, California will be at risk of involuntary
outages. Last summer, that mark was reached on 34 days.
   Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily
on the weather. If it's a cool summer, California might squeak by with
relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts. If the mercury rises,
electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners, and
the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time.
   This week's warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear
harbinger of a pattern expected all summer. Although power plants that
were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation, the week's two
blackouts "tend to indicate that the blackouts we'll have as we get
further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained," said Zenker.
   Exacerbating the state's inability to generate enough homegrown power is
the situation in the Pacific Northwest, where drought conditions are
severely curtailing hydroelectric production, meaning that California
cannot count on imports this summer.
   The state's next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be
enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats, shut off
their lights and shift their heavy usage to "off-peak" hours.
   "To avoid blackouts in California, we're going to need conservation," said
Jim McIntosh, director of operations for the ISO.
   Cutting consumption by 10 percent could get 5,000 megawatts off the grid,
according to Davis. And the Energy Commission says that various measures
enacted last September, such as incentives for businesses to paint their
roofs white (reducing their air-conditioning needs), will save 281
megawatts by June 1 and 334 megawatts by August. The governor's latest,
$800 million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional
2,061 megawatts by summer's end.
   But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for
cuts in home consumption.
   That's because the expected rate increases for electricity won't hit until
June, so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July.
Psychologically, many people will start serious conservation measures only
once they've taken a hit in their pocketbooks.
   Although Californians have already cut back enough to save 2,866 megawatts
during April, "I don't think more (conservation) will happen," said
Michael Shames, head of the Utility Consumers Action Network. "Markets
move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns."
   Davis's ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to 5,000
megawatts. In part, it relied on three huge power plants -- Los Medanos,
Sutter and Sunrise -- that had already been under construction for years
and are certain to come online this summer. But much of it was based on
getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or
build new facilities. Those efforts foundered on several issues:
   -- QFs: Davis was counting on getting dozens of so-called "qualifying
facilities" -- or QFs, basically small alternative energy generators -- to
ramp up production. That, plus restarting of two existing power plants,
would have added 1,244 megawatts. Instead, most QFs will produce only the
bare minimum, and one of the power plants may not be restarted.
   The QFs, which are paid directly by California's utilities, are still owed
millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January. And a
new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission
will slash payments for power they generate in the future. QFs say they
will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they can't recoup
their natural-gas costs.
   -- Peakers: Small, temporary power plants called peakers accounted for 2,
133 megawatts of Davis's plan. Although the Energy Commission sped up
licensing for peakers, many firms were competing for scarce resources to
get the mini power plants built.
   "There's an internal competition (among power firms) for transmission
interconnections, for natural-gas pipeline space, for turbine parts,"
O'Donnell said. "I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into
(the peaker plan) to begin with."

Rick,

Some comments from Nick are attached below.

Nick's first comment reflects a general concern I had about the paper which 
was it's treatment of imbalance settlement.  I would see this as one of the 
essential elements of market design.  I've always felt that the 
physical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with 
"physical" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of 
imbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to 
contract volumes).  However, the paper does not really pick this up and in 
section 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be "feasible" in some 
market structures.  I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1 
which describes the fundamentals required for any market.  It would also help 
to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement.

At the same time I would have dropped the mention of "binding market rules" 
from 2.1.  I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the 
operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental 
principle.  It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are 
binding.  Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are 
covered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is 
unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty 
which is ruled out later in the paper).

I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission 
rights with other non-locational elements of market design, this makes it 
difficult to follow in places.  It would be clearer to have the locational 
elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles.

Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed.  
As Nick hints at below, we wouldn't see this as an essential element of 
market design.  Under NETA, individual participants commit their own units 
with the SO only taking over full control at 3.5 hours out.  Even with 
centralised commitment, I'm not convinced that simple bidding would be 
superior to multi-part bids.  Much here depends on timescales, eg, a 
day-ahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc 
than a continuous hourly market with simple bids.  Simple bidding was often 
proposed for the Pool, but I think a single daily big would have increased 
prices if two-shifting generators had not been able to reflect their start-up 
and no-load costs separately.  (These elements were also gamed, although this 
game eroded as competition increased.)

Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper:

? we've consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside 
positions.  Publicly we've argued that the proposals do not provide good 
economic signals over sufficiently long time-periods to enhance allocative 
efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency 
gains (constraints only cost about o20m pa here).  Despite arguing our 
commercial position, I'm quite happy with this approach and am genuinely 
sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK.  This position 
would of course change in much larger, sparse and less-interconnected 
networks such as exist in parts of the US.
? Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must 
preserve pre-existing implied rights for generators, ie, grandfathering.  I 
recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with 
imcumbent market power, but I don't think that this is as big an issue in the 
UK (where competition already exists) as it is on the Contintent and in the 
US.

Hope these help, let me know if you want to discuss further.

Paul

Subject: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper

Paul,

Here's some comments on Frontier's whitepaper. Do you want to discuss them? 

Section 3.1
The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is 
blurred. Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification 
to Elexon. Even then a party doesn't need to deliver on the contract - it 
could cash out at the imbalance price. However, in practice NETA is more 
similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties 
try to avoid imbalances. 

Section 4.1.1
Decentralised commitment doesn't require parties to trade physical 
transmission contracts.  LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment.  It 
is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading 
unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates.  
Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs.

Interim model (section 5)
1) It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of 
jurisdictions in the US - because of the private stakes in the industry.
2) The proposed day-ahead market need not be run by the ISO.  It's not a unit 
commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment, and even if 
it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading.  Rather, day-ahead 
trading could be left to the market to develop.  Generators would self commit 
based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties 
could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading.  These 
day-ahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs - leaving parties 
with basis risk between the hub and their location.  Parties require some 
means of heging the basis risk - financial transmission rights is a 
possibility.

Competitive framework (section 6)
1) Demand side response reduces generators' market power.  Forward 
contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and 
consumers, particularly the impact of short term market power. This may be an 
argument for using HHIs to measure market power.
2) A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supply/demand 
imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk.  And it may deter new 
entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising.
3) With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers' 
forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs 
to customers.  Non-eligible customers create a problem.  What price should 
these customers pay?  It is difficult to regulate a supplier's contracts and 
to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and non-eligible 
customers.  This is why a spot price pass-through is suggested.  Financial 
institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers. Those 
institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators.  An 
alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of non-eligible customers.  
To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the 
supplier's downside and upside risk.

Late tonight, the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package 
(without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation) 
on a bipartisan vote of 29-1.  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. 
Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable 
energy projects.

During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern 
to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the 
full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  The amendments in this category are:

1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the "blackout and price gouging 
prevention amendment" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price 
mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based 
rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be 
withholding power from the grid during an emergency.  The cost-of-service 
rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the 
Western U.S.  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when 
it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it 
until full committee.  We will continue those efforts before the full 
committee vote.

2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote 
wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill 
rather than full committee on this bill).

3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the 
requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places.  He said that 
currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC 
approved.

4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop 
and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a 
UN agreement that President George Bush ("41") agreed to in 1992 (reducing 
these emissions to 1990 levels).

Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric 
restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending 
on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full 
committee and in the full House.

I am a private citizen with no direct financial interest in the energy

public comments of Californian Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, in the Wall

Rick and Steve -

Attached is Enron's government affairs strategy with respect to the potential 
threat of "201" restrictions on steel imports.   This was developed with the 
input of the DC office and outside counsel.  We will be meeting with Eric 
Thode later this week to discuss the public relations piece.  

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like background 
information on section 201.

Lisa

I attended the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association's Annual 
Post-Session Legislative Meeting, July 9 - 12.

Presentations were made by Louisiana Representatives Damico, Daniel, 
Montgomery, Pierre; Senators Barham, Theunissen; and Governor Foster's Deputy 
Chief of Staff covering the 2001 session, the upcoming special session in 
October and next year's "Fiscal Only" Session.

Although the vast majority of issues of interest to the industry were dealt 
with without much media attention, three issues - retail gasoline pricing, 
water policy management and the processing tax - received considerable media 
attention. 

Except as noted below, no legislation actively opposed by the oil and gas 
industry survived the legislative process.

The only setback for the industry dealt with legislation brought by an array 
of local government groups - police jurors, school boards, sheriffs, 
assessors and municipalities - in response to the continuing controversy over 
the parish property taxes paid by interstate pipeline companies. As part of 
the dispute, many pipeline companies have paid a portion of their taxes under 
protest - and that portion paid under protest, prior to passage of SB 1046, 
could not be budgeted or spent by local governments. While the passage of SB 
1046 will allow parish governing bodies to spend the protested taxes, a 
number of amendments offered by supporters of industry and taxpayer fairness 
were adopted that will work to assure that the taxpayers will get their money 
back in a timely manner if they prevail.

Although the Public Service Commission has the authority to open up the 
electric market to competition, the Legislature recognizes the importance of 
additional generation capacity and passed legislation urging the LA. Dept. of 
Economic Development to explore ways, including possible incentives, to 
encourage additional unregulated electric generation to be developed in 
Louisiana.

Water management received a lot of attention due to several plans for 
generating plants that would use groundwater (unlike Enron's plans to use 
surface water). SB 965 creates a Ground Water Management Commission that has 
the authority to define critical areas and regulate withdrawals in those 
areas. It also creates a Ground Water Advisory Task Force that provides for 
local and industry participation.

As far as the upcoming special session and the 2002 session are concerned, 
taxes will be in the forefront, including the much- dreaded processing tax , 
which would cost Enron about $50 million. According to the participating 
legislators and the Governor's staff, the processing tax is gaining momentum 
because of Sen. Foster Campbell persistence in bringing it up year after year 
and his promises that the processing tax will take care of Louisiana's budget 
problems. The industry will continue to vigorously oppose this tax.

Donald, Gavin and Jerry - I am sending you a summary of Louisiana Legislative 
Bills pertaining to the energy industry.

Luiz. Thank you for your note.  We are still in the boxing ring!. The first 
round was won but we still have some more rounds to go. Next week is the 
consent, provably in two weeks we will discuss the regulatory obstacles..

Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron 

Subject: Cuiaba Issues - July 6 situation-

Topic I -- Amendment 4

We spent the morning perfecting Aditivo 4 with Furnas, to cover the situation 
where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled. It was signed early 
afternoon and sent to Eletrobras.

The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal 
clearance. Furnas and the Ministry (Perazzo) called to give it priority. Late 
at night we received word that the "parecer" (opinion) was ready and that it 
the Anex would  signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board 
meeting next Tuesday.

Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key 
word "only". "Only" refers that they will not go after us for non-payment if 
Furnas does not pay. In the letter they also stated that they will commence 
the loading operation -- at their own risk - Saturday. This was requested by 
Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba 
from the refinery. 

[Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded 
and  in transit]

We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would 
not be a last minute hitch; otherwise, we may have to refuse to take the 
diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all.

Topic III - Consent Package (Opinions, Aditivo, Consent)
Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss. I instead 
insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and 
follow the Agenda  by looking at the Consent document package -- actually go 
over the text -  that they find objectionable, and,  if it the text had a 
direct link with any of their issues, we would discuss and examine the 
relative positions. 

What they told me is what they have told me before, that some of the issues 
have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree 
to the package. Which is fine to me, because it will make it clear to the 
government what we have been saying --- they want to change the deal. In 
Furnas' defense, I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad 
contract  and they want regulatory relief, which it has been granted, on a 
case-by-case basis, in other deals. So part of their strategy is to force 
MME, or Aneel to provide some tariff relief.

I asked them to list out  the key issues with the Consent-  Old-- a) the 90 
days additional time (Furnas), b) The guarantee substitution at the time of 
privatization, c) the lenders involvement on contract changes "we do not want 
to go to Washington to negotiate" - Newer - d) giving up their right to ask 
Aneel to "homologar", ratify; rather than "registrar" contract changes [big 
risk for us] . I believe the have more direct issues. 

We go back to Rio Monday (another holiday down the drain) ..and Tuesday to 
complete the list -- Topic II -- Regulatory conflicts

Jose

Below are the main features of the Sponsorship contract drafted by World 
Advisory Today (WAT) to be executed with Enron.
1.- Enron must pay Mexican pesos 100,000 plus VAT
2.- Enron will obtain:
2 banners (one in the main conference room, another in the dinning room)
presence in the attendants' folders, in the conference program, in the 
conference's diskette sheath and in the advertisement conference posters.
2 tickets
3.- WAT will decide where to install and the exact print of Enron's 
Industrial Property (what we wish to publish an advertise in the conference, 
I assume it is our logo).
4.- WAT is bound to protect Enron's Industrial Property
5.- The contract will expire on August 8, 2001 (last day of the conference). 
Perhaps we should claim to include the word "inclusive" after the expiration 
day.
6.- (clause or term invalidity); 7.- (waiver & force major); 8.- 
(notifications); and 9.- (rights transfer forbidden) are formal sections, 
usual in many contracts. I do not find anything unfair in them; however, I do 
not know if they are acceptable to our attorneys.
10.- The contract will be interpreted according to Mexican Laws. In case of 
conflict, parties will be subject to Mexico City Justice.
I doubt our lawyers accept to be subject to other country's Justice (unless 
there is an exemption due to the small contract amount).

Please let me know if you want a further analysis

Mike Roan and I met with Ed Martin, president of Wabash and Don Morton, his 
legal counsel to discuss their support for our RTO position.  (Mike did a 
nice job and I believe they will be supportive).

On the business side, Ed Martin would like to talk to someone from Enron to 
partner with them on a deal.  They have a load management device that can be 
installed in air conditioners (they are meeting with Lenox about this) and 
they need a partner to market it this to utilities as a means of reducing 
peak load and making power available for resale.  The product is geared 
towards the residential , but could be applicable to small, medium commercial 
customers and in some cases (depending on utility tariffs and what is 
available), larger customers.  The other angle would be to market this 
directly to customers, although that does not appear to be their focus.  I 
told Ed I would have someone get back to him.  Please advise if you are 
interested.

Thanks,
Janine

p.s.  You probably know this, but just in case, according to Ed , TVA is 
getting squeezed by Duke and Southern and is quietly lobbying folks like the 
Coops to raise the issue of increasing transmission capacity by building 
additional transmission lines to better inteconnect the system.

This is to inform you the recent approval of the below commented rules in 
Argentina. If the economic and political environment gets calmer, these rules 
will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us 
to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year.

Goal 1- Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps: there will not be more 
fuel declarations but price declarations (Section 1, Resolution 135). The 
rules do not mention any cap for price declarations.

Goal 2 - Daily fuel declaration: The 6 month fuel declaration was replaced by 
a daily price declaration (Section 1, Resolution 135).

Goal 3 - Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements 
with end users or LDCs: According to the interpretation of AGEERA (Gencos 
Association) we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may 
already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not 
have supply guarantee (Section 5, Resolution 135). It is not clear in the 
rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot.

Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the 
technical Procedures in line with these rules. From the text of Resolution 
135 (sections 3 c, 5 and considerations) there would be a good probability to 
reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule:
Reduce minimum term for Output & Demand Marketing Agreements to one month
Eliminate or reduce to 1 MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements

Amr and I are asisting Buenos Aires Ofice to analize the new rules to 
eventually submit comments to the Secretariat of Energy.
Attached is the document with the regulatory goals.

Guillermo

Subject: Power Decree 804 and Resolution 135

In an attempt to further reduce State intervention in the power market, on 
June 19, the Executive Branch issued Decree 804/01 which completes the 
deregulation process of the power industry initiated in 1992, and amends 
Electricity Law 24.065.  On June 26 the Minister of Infrastructure issued 
Resolution 135/01 setting forth  the guidelines for the future regulation of 
the Decree. 

The Secretariat of Energy's resolution that will regulate the Decree will be 
effective as from September 1, 2001. All agents of the electric sector will 
be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree, although such comments 
will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of 
Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document.  

Although Decree No 804/01 is effective as from today, there are doubts in the 
industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress.  The 
reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the 
framework of the Competitivity Law, by which Congress delegated to the 
Executive Branch its  powers to legislate  specifically on changes required 
to transform the economy.  Although this Decree and the changes it fosters 
indirectly affect the economy, since the law it amends is not purely 
"economical", it may be questioned.  There is no term within which Congress 
may exercise this right. 

Please find a summary of the relevant changes below.

Generators Remuneration:
Forward Market: freely negotiated
Spot Market:  only payment of "hourly spot price" at each node.
Hourly Spot Price: determined by price offers based on demand and 
transportation constraints


Daily Declarations
The day before the daily dispatch, each Generator shall: 
declare its price offers for each  peak, shoulder and valley hour at its 
node; 
declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity;  
offer all of its available capacity.

Calculation of Hourly Spot Price "HSP"
HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by 
the Secretariat of Energy, not based on marginal costs as it is today.
Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day.
At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations 
on the system.

Spot Market
Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the 
volume of energy delivered at the node, which shall be valued at the HSP.
If distributors, large users and/or marketers enter into supply contracts 
then to clear transactions on the spot market , the OED shall consider that 
the sellers (Marketers/Generators) assume their clients payment obligations 
before the market.
On spot market transactions, Generators shall not receive payments for any 
other concept.

Forward Market
Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors, 
marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms.

Marketers
Are now considered agents of the electric sector.
May enter into forward contracts and/or carry our purchase and sale 
transactions on the spot market at the node HSP.
Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system.
Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors 
when they transact at the MEM.

Congestion Rights  
Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices 
between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant 
transmission system.
In the case of: 
Existing transportation lines under concession, these rights belong to the 
State, which will sell them under a public offering called by the  
Secretariat of Energy.
Existing transportation lines carried out by an independent transporter shall 
belong to such transporter.
New transportation lines, shall belong to the owner of the same.

Expansions
Sole Risk Investment Expansions: Open to anyone who is interested; will 
require technical and environmental certification of the ENRE and license 
from the                 Secretariat of  Energy.

System Reliability Expansions:  Shall be built by awardee of public tender.

Distributors
Have to satisfy all demand of users within their area that have the choice of 
independently contracting their supply in the  MEM; Distributors may offer 
contracting options with or without supply guaranty; these contracts shall be 
considered special contracts
When they contract their demand with Generators and/or Marketers, the general 
terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will 
be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy;
In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their 
end users tariffs, the relation between the term of the contracts and the 
volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the 
greater the term of the contract, the lesser the percentage of contracted 
energy.
In any case, the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of 
the total demand of users that can't transact on the MEM.

Forced Dispatch
Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units;
The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of 
the same, Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are 
reasonable.
Such price shall not be transferred to end users and shall not be taken into 
account to calculate the HSP.

Rick - 

attached is the budget report as of March 23, 2001 for your review; I'm 
reviewing the SAP reports for each cost center and will let you know if there 
is anything out of the ordinary; there are several cost centers who are over 
budget for the month; I imagine that your cost center will be over budget for 
the month once salaries and wages for the end of the month are included; let 
me know of any questions, comments or concerns

In case it would be helpful, here is my current draft of some background 
information.
I'm still getting comments from a couple of people.
If you don't have time to look at it, just delete this, as I'll be 
distributing a final version shortly.

Rob Milnthorp have been discussing whether we want to look for a new 
regulatory person in Toronto.  We are leaning towards starting with a new 
face.  Give me a call to discuss.

FYI : this is the pack for the revised CE2 forecast for Gov Affairs.  It 
shows an 18% reduction on the original budget from $13.5m to $11.2m.  (CE1 
Forecast was $11.8m) . For rest of year, we merely scaled down T&E on the 
basis of the reduced headcount that had been given back in the CE1 forecast.  
(Forecast headcount to end of year is 25 vs 32 in original budget).  There 
may still be opportunities in Audit & Legal / Consultancy combined once we 
begin to review the contracts.
In Q2 we came in  $1.3m under the previous forecast, but we've just rephased 
that to the end of the year and kept it in the forecast on the basis that 
there may still be bills to come through.  Stephen Wood thinks that Michael 
may get tough and challenge why we can't release the underspend, but I think 
he ought to be sympathetic to our discussions on the possibility of a bigger 
regulatory battle later in the year and keep it in for that reason.

this pack to Michael today/tomorrow?

Do you want to discuss or are you content to run with this? 
(the forecast is the same as when left to go on leave - I have just added 
some commentary).
thanks

Per my first e-mail, here's MidAmerican's position letter on the stand alone 
Reliability measure.  Seems the best we can do with the utilities who have 
been supporting our position is to have them take a "no position" stance on 
the stand alone bill.

I think part of the issue is how the allocations are classified within the 
Europe analysis spreadsheet.  Asset Ops EHS and Reg Tech Analysis are 
classified as Asset Management, which doesn't seem to be an issue.  However, 
Chief Environmental Officer is classified by Europe as Public Relations, and 
Environment and Environmental Policy and Compliance are classified as Gov't 
Affairs.  We need to address whether these need to be consolidated as a 
separate category of EHS to include all of these cost center allocations.

This is the first time I've seen this spreadsheet, but I'm happy to work with 
Stephen to work out how to better reflect the categorization - this year if 
possible, and definately for next year.  This may be more at a policy level, 
however, so we may need further involvement of the budget owners.

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
"Environment" nor "Environmental policy and compliance". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our "Chief Environmental Officer". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

Title: Broadening the Search for Opportunities: Status of Retail Markets in 
the European Union
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2330


INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF EUROPEAN RETAIL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOTRH 
AMERICAN PLAYERS
As the movement toward competition in North American retail markets remains 
uncertain, it is important to consider how opportunities may be evolving in 
Europe.

* European Union Directives will eventually make the electric and gas markets 
more integrated and open, creating a single market comparable to North 
America.

* Significant restructuring of assets and processes is mirroring US 
restructuring activity at the wholesale and retail levels, and in some areas 
moving faster.

* Currently, the only robust competitive retail gas and power market is in 
the United Kingdom, although other countries are technically open with some 
customer switching and still others are soon to follow.

See dinner invite below. I am in Amsterdam anyway for meetings 6th and 7th. 
ABN Amro are relationship lenders to Enron Europe. Roger Harvey used to be in 
project finance team (from where I know him.) He now looks after the bank's 
energy clients for UK, NL and Germany. Two or three other companies may be 
represented at the dinner. Roger has invited us to dinner on the 6th in the 
context of the "Energy in Europe" conference, at which I am speaking 7th am 
and chairing a panel discussion among regulators 7th pm. 

Before the dinner there will be time for you to meet Prof. Littlechild again 
mid-pm (after your train journey from Brussels and Teun's and my lunchtime 
session with him) and then hold a review of Dutch developments with Teun. 

On morning of 7th you will fly to Paris.

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve

Rick - 

attached is the variance report for the month of March; the actuals are for 
March only and as you can see we are 1.3 million over budget for the month; I 
sent Elizabeth an email about the Hardy budget but it appears as though his 
budget has not been added but we are now absorbing costs for his group;  I'll 
work with Elizabeth to find out the status of moving the Hardy budget into 
yours or do you want the budget moved into the Washington cost center; please 
let me know

We are still working to get CP&L to reduce the interconnection fees by the 
existing plant amount (appr. $1.5 million).  However, I did get CP&L to 
recalculate the monthly O&M/replacement fee from the "state" calculation to 
the "FERC" calculation.  Heather said that this change alone results in a 
$140,000/year savings because the deal model had the higher fees built in.

Dear Colleague:

The Edison Electric Institute just published a report I wrote on Real-Time 
Balancing Operations and Markets: Key to Competitive Wholesale Electricity 
Markets. The report is available from the Publications page of my website, 
www.EHirst.com. Here is a summary of the report:

Electricity production and consumption must occur at essentially the same 
time. Therefore, real-time (minute-to-minute) operations and the associated 
markets and prices are essential ingredients of a competitive wholesale 
electricity industry. In addition, these intrahour markets are the foundation 
of all forward markets and contracts, including hour- and day-ahead markets, 
monthly futures, and bilateral contracts. Finally, these intrahour operations 
maintain system reliability by ensuring that enough and the right kinds of 
supply and demand resources are available when needed. 

Because of various load, generation, and transmission factors, balancing 
generation to load on a minute-to-minute basis is complicated. Loads are 
volatile, both from hour to hour and from minute to minute during the morning 
rampup and evening dropoff. Generators differ substantially in their costs of 
electricity production. In addition, generators have various idiosyncratic 
characteristics, such as maximum and minimum output levels and maximum 
ramprates, that limit their ability to respond rapidly to changes in system 
load or generation. Finally, transmission characteristics affect the 
real-time balancing function because of congestion and sudden transmission 
outages. These factors can lead to dramatic and rapid changes in electricity 
prices, including occasional negative prices when generators pay someone to 
take their output.

The early years of operations by independent system operators (ISOs), based 
on the experiences in New England, New York, and California, show how 
difficult it is to translate the theory and initial design of competitive 
markets into ones that work efficiently. These ISOs have been plagued with 
various startup problems that artificially raise electricity costs to 
consumers, implicitly encourage strategic bidding by some generators, do not 
sufficiently discipline generator market power, sometimes yield insufficient 
resources, and impair reliability. Fortunately, the ISOs have been quick to 
identify and remedy flaws in their initial market designs. On the other hand, 
the ISOs have done a poor job of documenting these problems and their 
resolutions.

This report is primarily a primer on how such intrahour operations and 
markets should work. It demonstrates these principles through several 
examples. These examples deal with generator ramprate limits, low-operating 
limits, startup costs, and other generator characteristics. Other examples 
show how energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units differ in their bidding and 
operations from capacity-constrained (e.g., thermal) units, how the 
consideration of multiple time intervals affects operations and pricing, how 
generators located outside the control area are treated differently from 
those within the control-area boundary, how interval pricing combined with 
hourly settlements can encourage generators to ignore dispatch signals, and 
how intermittent resources (such as wind) affect control-area operations. 

Although U.S. wholesale competitive markets today suffer from a variety of 
problems, there is reason to be optimistic. Ultimately, the ISOs (and, later 
on, RTOs) will identify and fix the problems within their market structures, 
and they will adequately document their problems and the associated 
resolutions so that their market participants and the designers of other 
systems can learn from past mistakes. Ultimately, efficient real-time markets 
should allow reliability councils and system operators to largely replace 
command-and-control rules with market signals (i.e., prices that vary rapidly 
in response to changes in system security). These changes should lower the 
costs of maintaining reliability; deploy supply and demand resources more 
efficiently; and guide investments in new generation, transmission, and 
demand-side resources.

I spoke with Scott Miller yesterday about several issues, so of course 
California came up.  Scott expressed frustration with the California 
situation and indicated that he thinks California will never be able to move 
away from its current problems without a comprehensive solution, led by an 
entity like the Administration.  Scott said he thinks all the parties need to 
come to the table and reach some sort of agreement to net out the differences 
between what suppliers are owed and what California thinks it is owed in 
refunds.  Once that is accomplished, the parties would then agree to enter 
into 1-3 year supply contracts at agreed-upon prices for the bulk of 
California's power needs.

Scott has been floating this idea with his colleagues (unnamed) who countered 
with "Would Ken Lay agree to something like that?"  I told him that I agree 
there needs to be a comprehensive solution to California but I did not know 
what Enron would agree to.  I asked him if he has heard anything about the 
Vice President's task force and whether the report will propose something 
like this.  Scott indicated that he and his group have had no contact with 
the task force and he has no information as to what will be in the report.  
This workout plan is just Scott's idea for now.

Scott said he thinks the current scenario is unworkable, that there is not a 
lot of internal support for Hebert's approach, and that things will get 
worse.  For example, Scott said that although generators are the only 
suppliers subject to cost justification at present, if the problems continue, 
marketers will be subject to the same cost justification in the future.

I thought you all would be interested in this conversation.  I told Scott 
that since Joe has changed jobs, that he should feel free to call me with 
questions or to talk about things like this, and he also told me to call him 
whenever we need him.  Although Scott is not expecting a response from us on 
his California idea, if we do have some sort of response, we may want to 
convey it to him just to show our interest in working  with him and his group 
and that we have a similar interest in resolving the problems in California.

Good points.

Economic Equilibrium. You are right. We can claim it. However, it may be=20

This is a very important issue. Although in case of loss to Elektro, we wou=

Subject: Generators want to kill Annex V

The rumor mill says that generators want to revoke Annex V. No surprise. Th=
e=20
bad news is that it seems that Aneel likes the idea.

This may represent a US$ 60 million loss to Elektro, only in 2001.=20

Distribution companies are [aparently] against this measure. However, D/Cs =
is=20
short position will [likely] applaud the idea (to avoid costly exposures in=
=20
the MAE)

An Abradee group was created to think about the issue. Joao and Fred will=
=20
participate tomorrow.

A few supporting arguments.

1) Contract sanctity. Why changing the rules in the middle of the game if=
=20
Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing conditions?=20

2) More subtle argument. The risk of  being exposed is the only economic=20
incentive  for a D/C to reduce its load. Otherwise, we will have a classica=
l=20
"free ride" problem: D/Cs will not put any effort to reduce their=20
loads/revenues and will advocate for an ex-post adjustment on ICs based on=
=20
verified load reduction. We can build a case that in the absence of this=20
exposure, D/Cs will have no incentives to work hand in hand with their=20
clients to foster load reduction and the whole program will fail.

Debora is working on the legal aspects of Annex V, taking into account the=
=20
new MP. Sergio has talked to a few lawyers to get their views/written=20
opinions.

What about writing a letter to Pedro Parente as Enron, exploring those issu=
es=20
and explaining why Annex V is so important to the success of the whole=20
program? (the free ride issue)

The following would be used only in response to media questions regarding 
PG&E credit exposure.

Enron does not comment on specific credit exposures.  We are confident we 
have established adequate reserves related to energy issues in California and 
regardless of what happens there we are also confident we will meet our 2001 
(recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

(If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration)  
There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed 
money by PG&E.  All of them are subject to to modification as information is 
corrected or updated.  The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates 
based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly.

(If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter)  Enron will not 
comment on specific credit exposures.  We will not confirm or deny any such 
numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence.  Any number presented 
would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other 
credit offsets available under the circumstances.  Again, we are very 
confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting 
our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

If we are asked if we filed to be on the creditor committee, I would confirm 
that we did, and we are.

Mark

Rick,

I am sending you the presentation that was circulated in Steve's meeting last 
Monday, by Jim. This was initiated in a California Conference call when news 
about prices going down first came to be known. Alan drew the very first cut, 
but then I had subsequently changed it quite a bit after getting feedback 
from Tom Briggs, Alan, Jim Steffes, paul Kaufman, Linda Robertson and others.

A few slides from this presentation were then used by Steve for his Madrid 
visit. Mark  Palmer circulated only the graphs of prices going down to the 
press, after he attended Steve's meeting.

I thought of updating you on the same

Regards
Ban

SCE Agrees to Sell Transmission Assets to California=20

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

At a joint press conference with Governor Gray Davis, Edison International=
=20
Chairman, President and CEO John Bryson announced agreement on a plan to=20
restore Southern California Edison (SCE) to financial health. "The negotiat=
ed=20
resolution with the Governor is far preferable for our company, our employe=
es=20
and for our customers than is going into bankruptcy," Bryson said. The key=
=20
part of the agreement is that the state will receive a primary utility asse=
t=01*
SCE's 12,000 mile transmission system. SCE employees will operate and=20
maintain the system through a contractual arrangement with the state.=20

Analysis: Only days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co., its California utilit=
y=20
counterpart, declared bankruptcy, SCE announced what is being billed as a=
=20
pact with the State of California that should keep it out of bankruptcy=20
court. From all appearances, this seems to be a strong deal for SCE, as it=
=20
not only keeps the utility financially solvent but also removes it from a=
=20
line of business that remains rather uncertain and financially unrewarding.=
=20

First, let's establish the key aspects of the agreement. Keep in mind that=
=20
the California Legislature, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPU=
C)=20
and federal regulators must approve this deal. Edison International (NYSE:=
=20
EIX), the parent of SCE, has agreed to sell the utility's transmission asse=
ts=20
to the State of California for $2.76 billion. The confirmed price tag that=
=20
the state is paying for SCE's lines seems like a generous offer because it =
is=20
about 2.3 times the system's current book value of $1.2 billion (the origin=
al=20
cost, less any accumulated depreciation (OCLD) recorded in SCE's books).=20
Since transmission rates are based on an allowed rate of return on OCLD, it=
=20
is uncertain that SCE's current transmission rates will provide sufficient=
=20
revenues for the state to cover its purchase cost.=20

The sale includes only SCE's transmission assets. It appears that SCE will=
=20
remain in the distribution business and continue delivering power to=20
customers and running generation. Both the state and SCE have agreed to=20
commit to no less than $3 billion of capital investment in utility=20
infrastructure over the next five years, which presumably includes upgrades=
=20
to the transmission system and new generation capacity. It is not entirely=
=20
clear at this time how the $3 billion in capital investment will be shared=
=20
between the State of California and SCE.=20

Edison officials also have agreed to sell cost-based (not market-based)=20
electricity to the state from power generated at SCE plants. Edison Mission=
=20
Energy, the unregulated subsidiary of Edison International, is also obligat=
ed=20
to sell output from its Sunrise power plant exclusively to California under=
=20
cost-based pricing. Although SCE divested much of its power assets under=20
agreements with the CPUC, it still shares ownership of the San Onofre Nucle=
ar=20
Plant Units 1, 2 and 3 with San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), and shares in=
=20
the Palo Verde, Mohave and Four Corners generating stations. SCE also owns=
=20
hydroelectric facilities and the Pebbly Beach generating facility. The=20
Sunrise Mission power project is a gas-fired power plant that is currently=
=20
under construction. Reportedly, the Sunrise plant is expected to provide=20
about 320 MW of electricity during peak periods of demand this summer.=20
According to the Memorandum of Understanding between SCE and the California=
=20
Department of Water Resources, "SCE's generation assets=01*including all en=
ergy,=20
capacity, ancillary services, and any combination thereof=01*will be commit=
ted=20
to cost-based ratemaking for SCE's bundled service customers." In addition,=
=20
SCE is prohibited from selling any of these generation assets until Dec. 31=
,=20
2010.=20

Also included within the agreement is SCE's commitment to dismiss all pendi=
ng=20
lawsuits against the CPUC related to market prices in California. Edison=20
International also has agreed to refund $400 million to the utility unit th=
at=20
reportedly had been paid in dividends to the parent company.=20

The $2.76 billion that the state is paying SCE for its transmission assets=
=20
can be used to pay pre-existing debt to creditors, including power generato=
rs=20
that have previously sold power to SCE. This is the essential benefit that=
=20
the utility receives in the deal and it is a considerable achievement given=
=20
that the liquid capital theoretically should stave off bankruptcy=20
proceedings. It is also important to note that this is the first revenue=20
stream that has been specifically earmarked for SCE's pre-existing debts.=
=20
Recent rate increases that have been approved by the CPUC can only be appli=
ed=20
to subsequent debts incurred by the utility. In addition, SCE will be allow=
ed=20
to issue bonds to recover a "substantial portion" of the approximate $5=20
billion in debt that the utility has accrued due to uncollected purchases o=
f=20
wholesale power. The agreement should return SCE's debt to investment grade=
,=20
making it easier for the company to raise money to fund future operations. =
By=20
reducing its debt load, Edison CEO John Bryson remains confident that SCE=
=20
"can borrow to pay out [remaining] debts."=20

SCE Chairman and CEO Stephen Frank expressed confidence that a final=20
agreement could be reached "before the end of the year," although the=20
California Legislature reportedly has agreed to expedite its own review of=
=20
the agreement and provide approval before summer temperatures begin to wrea=
k=20
havoc on the California market. If for any reason the sale of the=20
transmission assets has not been completed within two years, SCE is obligat=
ed=20
to sell to the state its hydroelectric generation facilities instead (at a=
=20
to-be-determined price). Although the deal is expected to proceed, some=20
concerns have been raised about federal issues related to interstate=20
commerce. In addition, the fact that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.=01*with whi=
ch=20
SCE has often been intertwined=01*remains in bankruptcy court could also=20
complicate the agreement between SCE and the state. =20

News of the agreement immediately caused Edison shares to increase by about=
=20
$2.16, or 24 percent, to $11.08 on April 9. As of the close of trading on=
=20
April 10, Edison shares were priced at about $11.38. =20

For its part, SCE said that it was "racing toward" an agreement with the=20
governor to avoid being forced into an involuntary bankruptcy. Yet, for som=
e=20
time, SCE has been more willing to sell its transmission assets than PGOeve=
r=20
appeared to be. In fact, I wrote in the 2/26/01 IssueAlert that Gov. Davis=
=20
had reached an "agreement in principle" with SCE regarding the sale of the=
=20
transmission lines. Most of the key elements of the agreement that has been=
=20
agreed to by both parties have been in the works for over two months. =20

PGOCorp. issued a statement that it was pleased that SCE had been able to=
=20
reach an agreement with Gov. Davis, but said that the agreement did not=20
change its own direction toward bankruptcy court. According to a report on=
=20
CBS.MarketWatch.com, Fitch analysts have suggested that the sale of SCE's=
=20
transmission assets to the state of California could in fact lend a=20
"framework" that might be used in Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy=
=20
proceedings. What this might mean is that Federal Judge Dennis Montali, the=
=20
official overseeing Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy, might rely upo=
n=20
the agreement between SCE and the State of California to mandate a similar=
=20
deal for PG&E.  Gov. Davis commented that the SCE deal could serve as a bas=
is=20
for separate agreements with SDG&E, and eventually PG&E, if they choose to=
=20
come back to the negotiating table. In fact, the state could submit a plan =
to=20
Judge Montali outlining a purchase of PG&E's transmission assets, which the=
=20
judge could ultimately enforce.=20

An argument could be made that the agreement SCE has reached with the State=
=20
of the California provides benefits to the utility that go beyond protectin=
g=20
it from bankruptcy. One could argue that SCE benefits by being able to exit=
=20
the transmission business altogether, which in many ways can cause tremendo=
us=20
problems for the companies that choose to remain in this business.=20
Transmission operations also typically offer a low rate of return; in SCE's=
=20
case, according to its most recent 10K filing, its transmission business=20
resulted in a return on equity of 9.68 percent. SCE had proposed that the=
=20
return on equity for its transmission assets be set at 11.6 percent, which=
=20
FERC rejected (FERC has ultimate authority over transmission service=20
pricing). Thus, the question could be raised of why SCE would even want to=
=20
remain in the transmission business, given this low return on equity. Behin=
d=20
the scenes, SCE could very well have previously made the determination that=
=20
its transmission business was not a valuable part of its overall operation.=
=20
This could be representative of an international trend, as regulatory=20
agencies in Australia and Great Britain have also set lower limits on the=
=20
average transmission network charges that utilities can implement.=20

Moreover, the State of California does not bring extensive operational=20
expertise to its new role as a transmission owner. Thus, the state is wise =
to=20
keep SCE employees in charge of the operation and maintenance of the=20
transmission system. This substantially reduces the risk for the state, whi=
ch=20
is a prudent move. From the state's perspective, it gets an asset in exchan=
ge=20
for a bailout, which makes its investment in SCE beneficial. However, the=
=20
transmission business will present unique challenges for the state, such as=
=20
raising capital for transmission improvements and siting procedures. The=20
state may quickly learn why the transmission business is perceived as being=
=20
so challenging, and why it is difficult to entice companies to build new=20
transmission lines (especially considering the low rate of return that the=
=20
transmission business offers). On the other hand, by assuming the role of a=
=20
transmission system owner, the State of California will be in a position to=
=20
obtain competitive information about the activities of power generators in=
=20
the state. This could result in a significant advantage for the State of=20
California if it remains in its current power-buying role. =20

201 Situation:

Powell Goldstein called to clarify what the situation is after several 
misleading trade press articles indicated that the Administration was leaning 
against filing a Section 201 initiation.   The Bottom Line is:  the 
Administration is still very much undecided on how to proceed on a 201 
investigation and even more undecided on which remedy to implement if harm is 
found.   We have learned from Senior level officials they are considering the 
following options:

Option 1: The Administration will initiate a Section 201 investigation on 
steel with an accompanying statement saying that the initiation does not in 
anyway indicate if and what remedy would be implemented.  The threat to an 
Administration investigation, is that quotas are the expected remedy.  By 
taking this approach, the Administration would allow the ITC to determine if 
the imports are trade related or a result of industry market structure, while 
placing a chilling effect on the possible implementation of quotas.   The 
USTR supports this approach; the Department of Treasury has not been persuade 
it is prudent; the  Department of Commerce is trying to negotiate the middle 
ground; and the White House is still undecided.

Option 2:  Allow the Senate Finance Committee to initiate a 201 
investigation, but issue a similar statement indicating no remedy 
commitment.  

Timing: 

The EU-US Summit is meeting the second week of June and this will be on the 
agenda, so do not expect anything before June 14.  The Senate Finance 
Committee is in transition after Sen. Jeffords switched parties and the 
Committees are being reformulated, which could take several weeks.  Look to 
the end of June for a decision by the Administration.  The Administration 
will face pressure to make a decision after the Steel Workers converge on 
Washington next week.  

Remedy:

There has been some confusion about a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA) 
being negotiated in place of a 201 investigation.  We have learned that this 
is not going to happen.  The MSA is one of the possible remedies, but the 
Administration has made it clear that it would only be a possible remedy if a 
Sec. 201 investigation is initiated.  An MSA would require voluntary 
restraints negotiated between all steel producing nations.  Another option 
are voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs) which are bilaterally negotiated 
agreements.   The other options are well known:  quotas, tariffs, 
quantitative restrictions, etc.

This month EES successfully renewed its affinity relationship with the Maine 
Electric Consumers Cooperative.  MECC, you will recall, is the C&I load 
aggregation group put together by Tony Buxton and Rich Silkman.  With the 
establishment of new market-based standard offer prices effective March 1, 
2001 customers in the aggregation group responded very favorably to the 
MECC/EES offers.  More than half of the load opted for five-year deals 
bringing sales to over 3 million mWh.  I am told as of last Friday the 
transactions booked a total aggregate margin of $21 million.

Phyllis Anzalone deserves most of the credit for bringing this one home.  
While I was not always involved in the day-to-day negotiations, I am proud to 
have strongly promoted the relationship with MECC and to have played a hand 
in the Maine Restructuring Law that made this and the ENA transaction

We are preparing a presentation for the Argentine Secretariat of Energy 
commenting on several subjects. We must deliver this presentation first time 
Monday morning to the power marketers association of Argentina.
One of the key subjects covered are the guarantees required to power 
marketers.
We would highly appreciate if you could check if the (1 or 2 pages) summary 
written below still reflects the reality of the market you are involved 
and/or make the necessary changes. Only focus on the market of your expertise.
If you are not the appropriate person to ask for this information, please 
tell me who is.
Please copy the answer to Andrea Calo, since she will be updating the 
document during the weekend.
Thanks.

Please find attached the PUCT order approving, with modifications, the ERCO=
T=20
Protocols.  What follows is a brief summary of many of the points that=20
directly affect the ERCOT market.  I will provide a complete summary and=20
timeline for response or request for rehearing on any of the issues later=
=20
this week.

Two of the most noticeable departures  from the Protocols was for the=20
Commission to ask for a review of the balanced schedule requirement and a=
=20
departure from the current bilateral market to an LMP type market.  The=20
Commission directed ERCOT to respond with the technical feasibility of=20
relaxing or eliminating the balanced schedule requirement.  The other=20
departure from the ERCOT protocols by the Commission is in reference to loc=
al=20
or intrazonal congestion.  The Commission states that if direct assignment =
of=20
the local congestion to the generating resources is not possible, they will=
=20
consider other market options such as an LMP model.  The Commission will=20
review both of these market concepts in September 2001.=20

The ERCOT Protocol Review Subcommittee will take the ordered protocols and=
=20
start the process of Protocol Revision.  Each of the revisions have been=20
assigned a completion date by the PUCT and can be found in schedule 4=20
attached.



The PUCT approved the ERCOT petition and Ordered the that the Protocols=20
should take effect June 1, 2001.  The Commission state that the Protocols a=
re=20
fundamentally sound, however there are certain provisions that are boxed=20
(cannot take effect until the ERCOT system can accommodate them) as provide=
d=20
for in the Protocol Implementation Plan.  ERCOT was directed to initiate a=
=20
process to implement the boxed provisions as soon as possible.  As for the=
=20
rest of the changed required by the PUCT, a timeline was attached for the=
=20
implementation of the protocol revisions.
Under the Protocols as filed, ERCOT had =01&sole discretion=018 for its con=
duct,=20
however, the PUCT will require ERCOT to exercise its discretion in a=20
=01&reasonable, nondiscriminatory manner.=018
Ancillary Services.  The Protocols require ERCOT to procure the following=
=20
Ancillary Services sequentially through an Auction:  regulation down,=20
regulation up, responsive reserves and non-spinning reserves.  The PUCT is=
=20
concerned that the process results in the possibility of price reversals=20
where the clearing price for some A/S may be higher than other higher grade=
=20
A/S services which may create incentives to game the system.  The PUCT=20
directed ERCOT to amend the Protocols such that it will procure A/S through=
=20
use of simultaneous optimization for assignment of resources to A/S product=
s,=20
and will set prices for each A/S to the corresponding shadow price.  The PU=
CT=20
also ordered to ERCOT to amend the protocols such that it will use a two=20
settlement system for the procurement of A/S.  The day ahead period=20
procurement will settle and announce at 13:30 with the second to take place=
=20
during the adjustment period for each hour.  Until the system is capable of=
=20
the two-settlement system, ERCOT must amend the system to only allow downwa=
rd=20
adjustment of prices for unselected A/S bids and allow unselected bids by a=
=20
QSE to be withdrawn only in descending order of bid prices.  The wrinkle he=
re=20
is that the ERCOT system purges unselected bids and will require a manual=
=20
tracking of the bids.  A =01&spot check=018 for the activity has been discu=
ssed. =20
Finally, ERCOT is to consider and report whether or not ERCOT should make=
=20
conditional selections of A/S bids (from a QSE portfolio) and then possible=
=20
deselect based on location and not price after the QSE resource plans are=
=20
published.
Market Solution.  Under the ERCOT protocols, a Market Solution for reducing=
=20
congestion exists when at least three unaffiliated resources have available=
=20
capacity and the ability to submit a bid to ERCOT to solve a circumstance o=
f=20
local congestion and no one bidder is essential to solve the congestion.  T=
he=20
PUCT would like the protocol amended to require that a =01&market solution=
=018=20
exists only when at least three bids are received from unaffiliated resourc=
es.
Out of Merit Order (OOM) Service.  The PUCT directs ERCOT to use the same=
=20
ratcheting sown mechanism for out of merit order capacity payments to out o=
f=20
merit order energy payments that are based on the 18,000 heat rates.
Reliability Must-Run Service.  The PUCT would like to have additional=20
incentives for generation entities to enter into RMR service contracts and=
=20
that once covered, the until will be efficiently utilized.  As such, ERCOT =
is=20
to amen the Protocols to give an RMR unit owner the additional option for=
=20
retaining 10% of net positive margins for energy generated in excess of the=
=20
amount that the unit is obligated to produce under its RMR contract.
Uninstructed Deviations.  In order to encourage =01&good price chasing=018 =
and=20
discourage =01&bad price chasing,=018 ERCOT was ordered to amend the Protoc=
ols to=20
apply the ex ante MCPE for balancing energy set ten minutes for the beginni=

=20
during the settlement interval and use the second subsequent interval ex=20
poste MCPE, which will be set five minutes after the end of the first=20
settlement interval, for uninstructed deviations during the first load=20
interval.
Bid Caps.  During the transition period, until July 4, 2004,  there shall b=
e=20
a generation resource bid cap of $1,000 per MWh for energy that ERCOT=20
procures.  The bid cap does not apply to load resources.  ERCOT was also=20
directed to develop and submit for possible approval a bid cap on capacity=

bids for generation resource offering to provide replacement reserve servic=

Balance Schedule Requirement.  The current Protocols require QSEs submit a=

balanced schedule, however, the PUCT intends to consider in September, 2001=
,=20
the policy implications of the balanced schedule requirement, and whether t=
he=20
requirement should be relaxed or eliminated.  ERCOT was also directed to=20
report on the technical implications of relaxing or eliminating the balance=

schedule requirement.
Inter-zonal Congestion.  ERCOT shall amend the Protocols to convert to the=
=20
direct assignment of inter-zonal congestion costs, and base direct assignme=

contingencies.  ERCOT's obligation to guarantee full zone-to-zone- congesti=

Preassigned TCRs.  MOUs and Coops that own or have a long-term annual=20

As I understand Rick's message and discussion with Harry.......... can you 
try something like this:

1)  Legislatively blocking open-access is a radical response to a perceived 
"short-term" problem and is not necessary to achieve the goal of HB 1692.  
The legislature has found that competition is an appropriate remendy 
(alternative) to regulation through the passage of SB7.
2)  The legislature recognized that certain areas of Texas requires a more 
"structured" schedule than that required for the rest of the State and 
nothing that has happened in the recent past should change that recognition.
3)  If price protection is the legislature's concern (an the purpose of HB 
1692), we can provide language in HB 1692 that meets their concern by; a)  
continue cost-based regulation for utiity service with no additional costs 
due to limited open-access, b)  allow limited open-access as an alternative 
to utility service (more options available to customers are better than no 
options if price protection is the goal) and c) there are no guarantees that 
cost-based rate regulation will meet the objective of HB 1692 (rates can go 
up due to load growth, load decline, fuel price volatility and other economic 
factors).
4)  Customers (wholesale and retail) should support this.  Certainly gives 
them leverage against potential rate increases under regulation.
5)  SPS will likely want assurances that their shareholders are not adversly 
affected (dollars spent to implement customer choice are allowed to be 
recovered in HB 1692).  This should be a non-issue.  
5)  Enron will be more than happy to assist SPS to dispose (market) any 
excess capacity/energy as a result of limited customer choice in a manner  
which may result in a better return to shareholders (amending 1692  may 
actually help SPS).


Jean, call Rick, Harry or myself if this is confusing.

guide states in setting "best available retrofit technology" (BART) 
requirements to comply with new Regional Haze standards.  The proposal was 
approved on Jan. 12 by then-EPA Administrator Carol Browner, but current 
Administrator Whitman was reviewing that decision to see if EPA should change 
course.   It is now clear that EPA intends to move forward.   The compliance 
deadline will be around 2008, but companies will be making decisions in the 
shorter-term about installing technologies or other compliance strategies.

The BART requirements will primarily affect coal utilities as well as 
industrial boilers, refiners and steel plants built between 1962 and 1977.   
While the rule will apply nationwide to facilities affecting national park 
areas, the main target of the rule were sources in Western U.S. states 
affecting visibility in the Grand Canyon.

In addition to technology requirements, an emissions trading program could 
become part of the compliance regime for the Western states, but only if the 
BART requirements are not providing the targeted reductions.

The AP story below provides a good summary of the rule.  Or if you're really 
adventurous, you can access the original 148-page proposed rule at: 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fr_notices/bartrule.pdf

Please call if you have any questions regarding the regulations or the impact 
on Enron businesses or customers.

Note -- I have included you on Environmental Strategies' current distribution 
list for "Regional Haze".  If you would like to be removed, or if others in 
your area should be added, please let me know.

EPA Adopts Rule to Cut Haze in Parks
By JOHN HEILPRIN, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration will not challenge a proposal
approved in the last days of the Clinton presidency to clean up hazy skies
over national parks and wilderness areas, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman said Tuesday.

The proposed rule, requiring states to impose pollution controls on
hundreds of older power plants, was approved by President Clinton eight
days before he left office. It would require coal-fired utilities,
industrial boilers, refineries and iron and steel plants built between 1962
and 1977 to be retrofitted with new pollution-control technology by 2013.

However, some could meet the requirements by swapping pollution credits,
which companies can earn and trade by reducing their overall emissions.

``Part of the President's commitment to protecting national parks includes
protecting the views that draw us to these parks year after year,'' Whitman
said. ``We intend to clear that air. This rule will help ensure that people
will be able to see and appreciate these national treasures for many years
to come.''

That would cut sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter and
directly improve the air in 156 national parks and wilderness areas, the
EPA said. Haze is caused when light hits tiny particles, such as soot,
sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emitted by power plants, refineries or
natural pollution sources, such as forest fires.

Whitman said the visibility in some national parks, like the Great Smoky
Mountains, is reduced by as much as 80 percent on the haziest days.

Environmentalists said Tuesday they worried the administration still might
try to delay or weaken the Clinton-era proposal before a final rule is
issued. The proposed rule already was studied by several federal agencies
under former President Clinton.

``The concern is that the White House or the Office of Management and
Budget or the utility industry would push for a weakening of the more
aggressive approach reflected in the Clinton proposal,'' said John Walke,
director of clean air programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Meanwhile, a group of utility companies has been fighting in federal court
for the past two years to block the EPA's regional haze program.

The proposed rule, amending part of EPA's 1999 regional haze rule, tells
states which of the older industrial facilities that emit more than 250
tons of view-impairing pollutants annually must install ``best available
retrofit technology.''

But it also gives states flexibility to consider economic factors, energy
impacts and the remaining useful life of the facility. The new requirements
also could be met through an emissions trading plan similar to one used in
EPA's acid rain program, giving states that take this option more time
beyond 2013 to comply.

States that affect the air quality of the Grand Canyon - Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming -
also would get different time frames to work with, the EPA said.

In Western states, the pollution cuts a 140-mile view down to 33 to 90
miles on average, the EPA said. In the East, 90-mile views often are
reduced to 14 to 24 miles on average.

Subject: Response to FERC: EOL

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting 
from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise 
and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  
Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim 
Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform 
Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor 
operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to 
meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John 
Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" 
they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader 
subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or 
otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than 
the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the 
benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the 
DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.

For purposes of the congressional staff visit on July 13th -- and in general

when folks on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online 
trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and 
energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  Just wanted to pass this on so

Please find attached the Letter to the Commission and assorted documents 
regarding the capacity auction implementation for ERCOT.  The PUCT approved 
this as a docketed case and as such we will need to file a Motion to 
intervene on or before May 21, 2001.  I am preparing to file the motion on 
behalf of EPMI.  There will be a pre-hearing conference on May 22, 2001 that 
will set the testimony and hearing schedule.  The auction must be completed 
by September 1, 2001.

This will be the last opportunity to comment before the PUCT prior to the 
first capacity auction.  As you review Schedule CA, please be aware that some 
of the provisions have two different proposals.  We may provide comments on 
the merits of one alternative or another or provide an alternative position 
that may not be included in the document.  The capacity auction rule itself 
will not be subject to comments at this time.  I will prepare an issues list 
and circulate it after the Pre-hearing conference (May 23, 2001).

After the first auction (September 1, 2001), staff will propose changes to 
the Capacity Auction Rule and/or the Capacity Auction process as needed.

Rick, Steve,

FYI

Last week President Fox invited Jaime Alatorre to his trip to Canada.  At 
some point they discussed energy reform and the need to bring in the private 
sector into the discussion to make sure that the new regulation was 
attractive to investors.

After that conversation President Fox asked Jaime Alatorre to head an effort 
to build consensus in the private sector with respect to energy reform.  He 
met today with Secretary Martens for 90 minutes to discuss strategy and 
implementation.

I am meeting this afternoon with Marten's Chief of Staff,  Mauricio Camps to 
give him materials and to discuss the main issues of the private sector and 
of the energy companies.

I think it will be very important to be very close to Jaime on this in order 
to be able to give him the necessary technical and strategic support that he 
will be needing during this process.  

Probably a way to do it is to congratulate him and to offer help.  We would 
then have to make sure that any of you have a periodical call with him for 
the group to have adequate information on the process and also to be able to 
identify areas of opportunity that will surely appear.

Please let me know how you want me to proceed or the degree of involvement 
that you want me to have on this.

Best,

Ricardo

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
"core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and 
the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing 
efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee "bully pulpit" to 
pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman 
Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they 
will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC 
takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.

The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee 
chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the 
legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms 
of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad 
oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including 
FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman 
today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.

In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 
featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps 
last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the 
anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will 
also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments 
against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20 
the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its 
duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates 
are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority 
staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses 
(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).

We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman 
Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including 
relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times 
article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no 
indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you 
might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.

Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write 
to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the 
entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can 
implement "negawatts" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the 
process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.

Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up 
portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the 
month unfolds.

Subject: ORR Investigate EWS Railways for Abuse of Dominance

Following our complaint to ORR about abuse of dominance by EWS Railways, they 
have formally launched a Competition Act investigation.  They have asked EWS 
to provide copies of all correspondence (including e-mails, records of 
telephone conversations etc) relating to their dealings with a range of 
counterparties.  (Failure to provide this information is a criminal 
offence.)  This information will support their investigation into two 
elements of our complaint, namely that EWS has effectively refused to deal 
with Enron Coal Services and that they have sought to foreclose the market to 
us by discriminatory pricing.  ORR is also currently discussing two other 
allegations with other relevant competition authorities:

with the European Commission - the impact of unduly long term contracts with 
some generators that have foreclosed the market to ECSL; and
wth the US Department of Justice -  EWS's attempts to unfairly influence GM's 
pricing of locomotives to EWS competitors.

ORR may launch a further investigation into these two allegations once the 
outcome of their jurisdictional discussions is clear.  At this stage, the 
investigation is still confidential and ORR see no need for further publicity 
at the current time.

Further details are in the attached fax.

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We 
think this is doable."
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
"frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a 
dedicated rate  component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of 
their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

SPAIN AND CALIFORNIA

Please, note that the regulator (CNE, advisory body) has recently declared 
that "the California situation cannot happen in Spain, although it is likely 
that some isolated blackouts may happen in the East coast this summer".


Physical crisis in Spain

To me, it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load 
margins in the Spanish power market have been recently decreasing, and that 
more generation capacity is needed! In fact, REE (Red Electrica de Espana, 
the transmission company and TSO) is relatively worried about shortages of 
capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years (6-8 percent). In 
Spain, no major power plants have been built in the last 20 years. The 
avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced (including 
Enron's Arcos CCGT 1200MW) since 1998 (outset of liberalisation) could cope 
with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation, 
regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed.

Authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that 
bad, and so it is connection to the electricity grid. However, access to gas 
pipelines still remains  as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these 
new gas fired power plants, but mostly, that some of the CCGTs projects (as 
Enron's) get financed (find attached the memo about the Enron's Arcos power 
plant). Pipelines are owned are managed by Enagas, which is 100 percent owned 
by Gas Natural, who controls more than 95% of gas supplies in Spain. 

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Prompt and adequated development of the gas system to make sure new gas 
fired plants are built.
2. For these new CCGTs to get financed, it is necessary that firm and 
continuous access is ensured by Enagas.  


Financial crisis in Spain

The regulator has also said that given the "vertically integrated structure 
of the Spanish power utilities, it is impossible that the California's 
financial crisis happen". This is only partially true because the CTCs buffer 
(stranded costs payments) have mitigated the financial stress of the 
utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs. In reality, what will 
prevent a financial crisis in Spain will be the Government, by increasing 
tariffs if things go nasty.

However, from the Enron perspective, the existence of CTCs is distorting the 
market, both for retailing activities and the development of power projects, 
since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals.


MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts 
of the Spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as 
possible. (By 2003, all customers will be eligible).
2. It is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated 
(distribution) and non-regulated activities (generation and supply), 
facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market, 
and reducing the market share of incumbents.


ITALY AND CALIFORNIA

Similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in Italy as 
those in Spain are equally valid. In addition, please note.

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more 
expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants.
2. It is imperative that the Italian TSO facilitates the localisation of new 
power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the 
transmission system capacity and expansion plans. The TSO must be there to 
help new developers (actually, the Italian TSO is very aware of this and has 
publicly declared to wish to go in this direction).
3. The Italian Power Pool was due for Jan 2001, but its start has being 
delayed, and it is uncertain when it will happen. For new entrants, to have 
the Pool live and running is of special interest to a) increase the 
understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the Italian market and 
b) to increase liquidity. Also, make sure you mention that the Pool should 
help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all 
participants, mostly on its inception phase.  


Please, find attached a short summary of the Arcos situation. The main issue 
here is that Enagas (gas transco monopoly) is trying to grant access to 
transportation and regasfication infrastructures CONDITIONAL to the 
construction of a number of new infrastructures, which are also subject to 
obtaining permits issued by the authorities. Instead, the regulator (CNE) has 
basically imposed Enagas an obligation to build and grant access to Enron on 
a firm and continuous basis, that is, no conditional. The regulator's 
decision is binding but not normative.

Rick - 

Attached is a revised budget spreadsheet for EGA for outside services fixed 
and discretionary and other business expenses.  Information was updated for 
Janine Migden fixed outside services (this is the IL lobbyist issue we 
discussed earlier today).  Please advise if you want me to send this

Folks:

Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
Hertzberg has it at about 20%.

New Market Opportunity:  Industrial Hourly Sales

I was wondering if it made sense to discuss internal to Enron Government=20
Affairs the concept of opening the Large Industrial Market to eCommerce.  I=
f=20
we think this is reasonable, maybe we can make a pitch to the Enron NetWork=
s.

It is my recollection that the current regulatory rules related to customer=
=20
switching and marketer enrollment do not allow large consumers to buy energ=
y=20
on a less than monthly basis - there is no switching within the month.  LDC=
s=20
have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were "paid" and=
=20
energy flows were in "balance".

To me, this regulatory "restriction" makes no sense at all.  First, big=20
consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly - staff and resources. =
=20
Second, big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute=20
lowest price.  Third, big consumers control the load which if proper price=
=20
signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks.  Finally,=
=20
the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous - they buy and sell energy=20
hourly.

To initiate this discussion, I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho=
=20
could find out in CA and PA, respectively, if I am correct about the=20
regulatory "restrictions".  The other question, for Jeff Brown, is whether =
or=20
not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the=
=20
purchasing of the large customer full requirements (for example, metering,=
=20
data needs, etc.).

Does this make sense to everyone?  If I am way out in left field, let's not=
=20
do alot of work.  It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big=20
consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce.

Subject: Enron Net Works


It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20

as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=

Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=

Subject: Proposed Enron Canada Advocacy Position on Gas Utility Hedging

As I have previously advised, there is an AEUB hearing scheduled to commence 
next week in Alberta that will address the issue of Atco Gas hedging the 
price of its default supply offering to customers in Alberta.  I am trying to 
finalize my instructions to our counsel on the position Enron Canada will 
advocate in relation to utility hedging of default gas supply. 

Atco is the primary gas utility in Alberta serving in excess of 90% of the 
natural gas customers in the province.   Based on the terminology that was 
recently used by Dan Allegretti and Sue Landwehr in their memo to Dave 
Delainey of April 13, 2001 's I would describe the Alberta gas market as an 
"open access jurisdiction" as Atco has existing transportation rates that 
allow "core customers" (residential, commercial, and institutional consumers) 
to purchase the commodity directly from a retailer.   

For the purpose of this hearing it is beyond the AEUB's jurisdiction to 
replace Atco as the default service provider by mandating the selection of 
one or more default service providers through a competitive bidding process.  
Also, in separate hearings the AEUB will be considering the issues of: 1) 
more complete unbundling,  and 2) the treatment of natural gas production 
assets that are presently subsidizing Atco's gas costs.  

Given that Enron is in the process of reconsidering its position on utility 
hedging and, more particularly, we have a vision of EES "sleeving" products 
to customers through the regulated utility, I thought I better brief you on 
the position I would like to advance in relation to Atco Gas being mandated 
to hedge default supply for its core customers: 

Atco should not be directed by the Board to use financial hedging to fix the 
price of natural gas supply to its core default customers as this could 
impede the development of the competitive retail market and/or delay entry of 
new retail participants
the development of a competitive and functional retail market is in the 
interests of core customers.  With the entry of new retailers will come a 
variety of new commodity pricing and term offerings 
the pace of entry on new retail market participants should not be a function 
of what will ultimately prove to be favorable or unfavorable hedging 
decisions made by the incumbent default supplier (i.e. unfavorable hedging 
decisions may actually accelate the development of a retail market subject to 
this being impeded by the introduction of exit fees to mitigate the stranded 
costs that may result from poor hedging decisions and subsequent customers 
exercising choice).  
it is adminstratively cumbersome and difficult for the Board to approve 
hedged rates as it would have an obligation to assess and make determinations 
respecting Atco hedging decisions.  
commodity price choices should be made by the customer who will be subject to 
the risks and benefits of this decision.  The decision should not be made on 
behalf of all default customers by their default service provider
the Board should focus its attention on the following two issues rather than 
on mandating hedging: 1) directing more frequent (rather than seasonal) 
default service commodity rate adjustments so Atco's actual monthly gas costs 
are more closely reflected in its default service rates; 2) the upcoming 
unbundling proceeding where the Board should ensure that unbundling 
principles are adopted that will result in Atco's default supply commodity 
costs not being subsidized by improperly functionalized costs from other 
distribution business functions.

I apologize for the short notice but your advice on whether my position is 
okay would be appreciated by tomorrow.  

Regards,

Rob

Rick, I attach a copy of the strategy paper I talked through with Steve Kean 
when I was in Houston in early March. It may provide you with some background 
on the environment in Japan and give you an idea as to where we are heading

At yesterday's FERC meeting the Commission voted out an order in the Alliance 
RTO proceeding.  This is another example how the new Commission, changed with 
two new members, can put more teeth in the RTO process.  The order requires 
Alliance to establish an independent board to make all the business decisions 
for the RTO until final approval for the RTO is granted.  Further, the order 
directs that a stakeholder advisory committee should advise the independent 
board.  FERC is concerned that business decisions prior to implementation of 
the Alliance RTO are made solely by the Alliance Companies.  The order 
directs Alliance Companies to decide which alternative business plans they 
intend to implement and file with the FERC within 45 days.  

Commissioner Massey issued a concurrence with the order in which he argues 
for the establishment of a mediation proceeding (like Northeast and 
Southeast) to direct the two RTOs - Alliance and MISO - to work to develop a 
single Midwest RTO.  Though Massey did not get any other votes for this 
process now, Commissioners Wood,  Brownell and Hebert, seemed to support the 
objective of single regional RTOs in the four main regions of the country, 
including NE, SE, MW and West.

Although no commitments were made, it is quite possible that FERC will order 
a mediation-type proceeding (as in NE and SE) if the Alliance RTO does not 
expand its scope in the near future.

Attached is a summary of the order.

   America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because

   California doesn't have enough electricity to meet its needs.  The

   rest of the country (including George W. Bush's energy secretary

   Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer through

   blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic

   National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine with letting

   Californians dangle in the breeze without enough power to meet

   their needs.  They laugh at Californians' frivolity.



   Here's how it really is:



   California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per person.

   California grows more than half the nation's fruit, nuts and vegetables.

   We're keeping them.  We need something to eat when the power

   goes out.  We grow 99 percent or more of the nation's almonds,

   artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives, persimmons, pistachios,

   prunes, raisins and walnuts.



   Hope you won't miss them.



   California is the nation's number one dairy state.  We're keeping our

   dairy products.  We'll need plenty of fresh ones since our refrigerators

   can't be relied upon.  Got milk?



   We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in state.

   Silicon Valley is ours, after all.  Without enough electricity, which

   you're apparently keeping for yourselves, we just plain don't have enough

   software to spare.

   We're keeping all our airplanes.  California builds a good percentage of
   the
   commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you want to go.
   When yours wear out, you'd better hope Boeing's Washington plant can keep
   you supplied.  There isn't enough electricity here to allow us to export
   any more
   planes than we need ourselves.  And while we're at it, we're keeping all
our

   high-tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons systems

   that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake up under

   the rule of some foreign kook.



   Oh, yeah, and if you want to make a long-distance call, remember

   where the satellite components and tracking systems come from.

   Maybe you could get back in the habit of writing letters.



   Want to see a blockbuster movie this weekend?  Come to California.

   We make them here. Since we'll now have to make them with our own

   electricity, we're keeping them.  Even if we shot them somewhere

   else, the labs, printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound

   facilities are all here.



   Want some nice domestic wine?  We produce over 17 million gallons

   per year.  We'll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we think

   about the fact that no matter how many California products we export to

   make the rest of America's lives better, America can't see its way

   clear to help us out with a little electricity.  You can no longer have
any
   of

   our wine.



   You all complain that we don't build enough power plants.  Well,

   you don't grow enough food, write enough software, make enough movies,

   build enough airplanes and defense systems or make enough wine.



   This is your last warning, America.  Lighten (us) up before it's

   too late.



   Love,

   The Californians

Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called "dry 
period relief" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a "proxy" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
"bullet proof". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument "no one should lose, no one should gain" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

LM

On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future 
participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at 
least in the near term because of their "monopoly" on the 
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into 
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the 
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry 
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged 
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed 
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response 
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are 
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to 
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the 
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide 
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC 
structure.  

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide 
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater 
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and 
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only 
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as 
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC 
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the 
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who 
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem 
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no "bright 
line" between the two.

Please contact me if you wish more details of the meeting.

Rick:   As Chris mentioned, we spoke to Oliver last week about the STB 
position.   I had also talked to him a few weeks ago about the same.    In 
addition, I've had several conversations with Joe Bill Watkins, an attorney 
in Austin who is working with the Greater Houston Community to find an 
"independent thinker" for this job.   

I recommend that we support Oliver Pennington.   It's clear from our 
conversations that he doesn't know much about the rail industry (he was 
inquiring about the difference between the STB's and the FRA's role in 
regulating the industry), but he appears to be -- and from all accounts, 
would be-- a fair-minded regulator.   He said he wants to "make a 
difference", and would not be afraid to shake things up to make that 
happen.   

As Chris suggests, we should not support the names being floated in the 
industry.   Bratten is a railroad sympathizer in shippers' clothing.    While 
Alice Turnquist is a good friend of Susan Lent (our lobbyist from Akin Gump), 
she is very close to Union Pacific.   Of all the rails, UP is the most 
resistant to change, and has a very well organized, very effective government 
affairs team in Washington.   

Besides Linda Morgan's spot, there is a second spot that will be open when 
Clyburn departs (his term has already expired).  I would also recommend that 
we interview Mark Palmer's friend (I cannot recall her  name) for this 
position.   She has excellent transportation experience, lives in Washington, 
and may be willing to step out to make much-needed changes to the 
industry.    We tried to reach her last week, but she was out of town for the 
holiday weekend.   I will follow up with Mark on this.

Best regards,
Lisa

		 Subject: STB Chair

Linda Morgan is the current Chair of the Surface Transportation Board and the 
Administration asked to her to stay during the transition, however it is 
highly unlikely that this will be made permanent.  The three names most often 
mentioned for the new Surface Transportation Board Chairman are Dwayne 
Ackerly (trucking company executive from Nebraska), John Bratten (National 
Grain and Feed Association Rail Committee Chair, also from Nebraska), and 
Alice Turnquist (former House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
Chair).

The railroads are not interested in the structural changes we would like to 
implement in the market and they have had a difficult time understanding the 
benefits of a secondary market in rail.  While the persons named above would 
be better than the current Chair, we are reluctant to support their 
nominations because of their close ties with the railroads (Union Pacific 
especially).  We think the ideal candidate for the job would be a fresh 
thinker that understands rail issues, but is not beholden to the railroads.

One name that has been mentioned is Texas attorney Oliver Pennington.  Lisa 
and I spoke to Mr. Pennington about the job and he is more interested in an 
SEC position, but is willing to examine the STB Chair.  We have confirmed 
that Mr. Pennington would be open to our rail proposal and would manage the 
STB as a consensus builder with all interested parties.  Mr. Pennington has 
his resume and other supporting documentation at the White House for both the 
SEC and STB positions.   Attached is Mr. Pennington's resume.  It is my 
understanding that Ken Lay has written a letter in support of Mr. 
Pennington's SEC nomination.

Mark Palmer has another name of a Washington attorney who he thought might be 
interested.   

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Rick - As requested, please find attached my proposed budget reductions for 
the remainder of this year.  Total reductions equal $168,000, which includes 
$35,000 of the Tabors TCC rcr which was originally approved for $75,000.   I 
also made a small cut in Travel of $10,000, but would be uneasy cutting 
anymore since we were very thin to begin with in this area  I have however 
reiterated to all of my staff, myself included, to spend each dollar as 
prudently as we can.  At this point I am not recommending any reductions in 
Staff, however, if things get real tight I may need to revisit the need for 
Teri Miller in the Concord office.

Looking to the end of the year, I estimate the need for the following:
 Florida - Retain Katz Kutter for the period July-December at $10,000 per 
month.  Current agreement is $20,000 per month but ends in June 01.
 Tabors New York/New England Support - Current rcr approved through April at 
$31,000 permonth combined.  I expect that we can cut that to $20,000 per 
month and will be putting in an rcr this week.  

I hope this is all we need to cut!  Please advise if we need to discuss 
further.

Steve

Linda,

Per our conversation today, I am emailing you the pertintent documents 
outlining our efforts in NY.  The key document you will want to read through 
is the ESES Message Action Memo (it's about 15 pages and it details the 
comprehensive  PR effort).  The other important attachment is the Concept 
Board for the potential ad campaign.  (THIS IS ONLY A CONCEPT BOARD AND WILL 
PROBABLY BE TWEAKED, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW AN AD MIGHT LOOK/SOUND.  
THE PR FIRM SORT OF MIXES RETAIL AND WHOLESALE MAREKTS BUT WE CAN FIX THAT).

I have left a message for Howard to call Jim D'Andrea, who has represented 
Keyspan at the coalition meetings, so that Jim knows you are calling his CEO. 

The coalition has been discussing this effort since Feb 1st.  Edison Mission, 
Keyspan and Morgan Stanley want to contribute money only and remain anonymous 
(all for different reasons).  They made their concerns known to the group 
from the start, but other companies hopped on that bandwagon last week.  The 
take away from today's meeting (Keyspan was not present) was as follows:

Our coalition is small (10 companies)
If 3 companies are out front (enron, dynegy and mirant) and 7 companies only 
contribute and attempt to remain anonymous - the reporters will ignore our 
message and write the story about the "anonymous donors"....not a good way to 
launch a coalition effort.
We would also be ignoring the $42,000 of research we paid for which concluded 
that people want to hear from "honest brokers", they want to know who we are, 
what we advocate and they want to be educated on what it is we're saying.
Today, the group agreed to go back and get a full commitment for 
participation from their companies.  Without full commitment and up front 
participation the group can't go foward.  
Even Edison Mission is going back and asking to fully participate (deal with 
any criticisms now rather than later).
No one believes that Morgan Stanley will commit to full participation given 
they are a unique company in this mix (but companies seem to be okay with 
them peeling off).
Thus, we need to ask Keyspan to rethink their role in the coaltion.  Can they 
go beyond a contributing role and be up front?
We'd love to have them fully participate, and we need to pose the question 
one last time. (Keyspan was not present for the PR presentation last week 
either so I highly doubt they have seen the plan in it's entirety (attached)
Coalition members agreed that they love the plan that our PR firm has 
presented.  This is a unique opportunity - one we don't want to miss when so 
many companies are aligning themselves with coalitions in preparation for the 
summer.  
(Phil Harris sent a letter to all PJM member companies asking for their 
participation in a similar effort). And IPPNY is also implementing a PR 
effort in NY (albeit a more narrow effort).

I'm back in Houston at 11:00 Thursday if you have additional questions.  

THANK YOU!
(DEADLINE FOR COMPANIES TO DECIDE IS FRIDAY AT NOON).

Brendan & I have been in discussion over the last few days, as he was 
concerned that his personal circumstances would prevent him from travelling 
out of Brussels for the next 6 months or so (except very occasionally), and 
about how this would affect his ability to support the Continental Gas 
business as he was hired to do.  Options included :

 (1) Brendan going back to the Commission for a year or two and reapproaching 
Enron after that period and 
 (2) keeping him in Brussels for the interim period and redefining the role 
to focus less on gas and to pick up other EC related work on ecommerce, 
environment, coal, steel etc.

Where Brendan has been involved so far, he has shown valuable knowledge of 
and insight into the Commission's working practices.  Following discussion 
with Eric, our recommendation is to keep Brendan in a Brussels position in 
the interim, rather than risk the possibility that after 1 or 2 years he 
never actually appears.  He should be available to transfer to London on a 
temporary (and perhaps even permanent) basis in early 2002.  Under these 
circumstances, I believe it would make more sense for Brendan to report to 
Peter Styles during this interim period.  Peter will open discussion with 
Brendan to define what he will be doing.  We'll need to consider separately 
how to support the Continental Gas activity, given the hole this creates.

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the "right to choose"
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.

Rick:

I hope that all is well. Believe me, I am not trying to interfere with your 
vacation, but here is a quick update of what I have learnt over the weekend.

Ken Ley had a meeting with the Indian Finance Minister in New York over this 
weekend.  No specific news of the outcome, but they believe here that our 
message was "we want out, facilitate it, or we shall go out very noisily".  
Ken Ley, and possibly Jeff, are expected here in India in the week of July 
8th.  No confirmation as of yet.  Perhaps you would like to consider that you 
and I are to be here too.  
I expect to have a meeting with Wade either tomorrow (Tuesday), or after to 
discuss the suggested plan (outlined below, and based on if renegotiation, 
then semi permanent support, if exiting, then a week every 4 to 6 weeks).  

Of course, I look forward for your advise, comments and suggestions.

I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.

The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining 
the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  
I look forward for your comments and advise.

Best regards

AI

Here are the salient features:
Meeting with Wade:
The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs 
to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and 
agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support 
from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what 
needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an 
effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) 
just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be "penny wise 
and pound foolish" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that 
Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is 
complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. 
GA Needs in India:
The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five 
areas: 
a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), 
b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, 
c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), 
e)  Government of India, and 
f)  EBS.  
The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following 
scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) 
Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of 
yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:

        Arbitration  Renegotiation
Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high
Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high
Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high
Government of India, and      high   high
EBS.         medium  medium

It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC 
seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the 
sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the 
best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any 
degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a 
risk-averse person shall take the "undetermined scenario" as equal to 
"renegotiation", while a risk-taker shall take the "undetermined"" as equal 
to arbitration.  

Personal:
It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in 
the "renegotiation" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a 
visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working 
under legal/commercial.  

Suggested Approach:
Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for 
the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the 
suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is "if there is 
renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full 
time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis".  

Caveat:
It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the 
suggested approach above one way or another.

		 Subject: India - Progress Report One

Rick: 
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and 
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting 
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from 
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing 
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support".  
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give 
Houston the final say.   

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA 
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and 
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, 
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit 
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams 
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation 
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the 
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is 
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market 
basis, but rather on accounting basis.  
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely 
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added 
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated 
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to 
complete phase II which we are refusing).  
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy 
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW 
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such 
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks 
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every 
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and 
solved.  
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest 
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them 
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned 
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the 
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the 
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the 
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment 
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the 
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of 
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there 
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for 
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to 
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you 
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards

Rick - 

Attached is the January 2001 variance report for your review and files.  The 
individual cost centers have some coding issues which need to be resolved but 
overall your group is under budget $828,597 for the month.  There are some 
coding issues within your cost center that we should discuss.

Call with any questions, comments or concerns.

Wade:

Two of the issues that I was looking forward to discuss with you in Houston 
were as follows:
The opinion of the GA - Washington Team of the outstanding Government Affairs 
issues that need to be taken care of in the coming period, and
How can Houston G&Reg. Affairs help you during Ken Ley expected visit to 
India.
 
Washington Team informed me that  they shall continue providing their support 
on as-needed basis.  Their understanding is that these needs  will be 
determined by you directly, as Jane was not directly involved in determining 
these needs.   They shall accommodate any changes in the personnel structure, 
if it happens, and will work accordingly.  In the same context, their 
evaluation at this time is that GoI is not ready to take a decision soon on 
DPC issue.  Furthermore, they even doubt any discussion that purports that 
GoI is deliberately ignoring the issues so that to create a form-of-a-crisis, 
then step forward to solve it and seek a quid-pro-quo from the US Gov.; 
Coalition governments are rarely that organized.  It follows, they continue, 
Dr. Ley's visit is unlikely to be effective, and very possibly, we are 
spending our "golden bullet" a bit too early.  

In reference to Ken Ley visit, I was trying to consolidate your team by 
asking Rick Shapiro to be in the same time in India.  The objectives are: a)  
introduce the entire Team in India (government, and regulatory, also 
commercial, and legal) to him so that he can rally all support your needs in 
a cost-effective, and continuous,  manner from Houston at this important 
juncture, and b) ensure that all resources from Washington are properly 
mobilized during this visit.   Please,  let me know what you think of this 
idea.

Finally, I am still working on EBS needs and shall keep you posted shortly.

Please find attached a short memo regarding last week's call with Jim and
the Enron RTO team. It also has some thoughts on what we might cover with
Steve K. at 2:00 p.m. CDT today.

Some other time I would like to have a quick chat about how we move to the
next step with the RTOs. It strikes me that there has been a real absence of
cleare-headed thinking in the stakeholder chin-wagging sessions. If FERC
will not impose a single design - on an abbreviated timeframe - is there
another way to add some economic logic into the equation?


Speak to you later...

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear 
something.

 TOP 10 PRIORITIES                                    1.  Alberta Power 
Purchase Agreements -  If Enron Canada is successful in the PPA auction, 
Enron Canada will have a very long position in the Alberta wholesale market; 
continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of  good transmission and 
distribution tariffs,  and development of rules for Plan "B" ( for those 
units that received no bids) will be 
critical.                                   2.  Continued support for  
ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in 
identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the 
later, work  with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re 
transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance 
opportunities for "Power by the Hour" and other distributed generation 
projects.)                              3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening 
- work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development 
of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the later, 
working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for 
interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial  
opportunities that exist.)                                  4. Enhancement of 
wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario.                              
5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada  in better understanding rules 
applicable   to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and 
Alberta.                     6. Alberta Natrural Gas 
Unbundling.                                  7. Renewed focus on potential 
for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the 
New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced  by a Liberal  
(pro-business) government in the province.                                
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE 
EFFECTIVE                                              1. Encourage 
government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to 
Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups 
in Houston. (In our case this would include 
Calgary).                               2. Replace or supplement the large 
group meetings with smaller meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can 
focus on issues of particular interest or enhance their understanding of a 
particular issue.  Seminars would be more in depth than what is possible in 
current group meeting format.                        3. Continue to enhance 
the information retrieval system so it  is easier to locate useful material 
(i.e. submissions, filings, etc.).                        4. Continue to 
emphasize to the commercial group  (at all levels) the value to Enron of  
involving  government affairs in every major transaction  (value enhancing, 
risk mitigating) -  this should become the practice rather than the 
exception.

PG&E Says National Energy Group Assets May Be at Risk (Correct)

PG&E Says National Energy Group Assets May Be at Risk (Correct)

     (Corrects second paragraph to reflect National Energy Group
doesn't hold utility's generating facilities and gas plants.)

     New York, May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Creditors of PG&E Corp.'s
bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit may be able to grab
assets of PG&E National Energy Group, a subsidiary the parent had
intended to insulate, PG&E told the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
     By February this year, PG&E had restructured National Energy
Group hoping to isolate the new unit's assets. The structure
allowed National Energy Group to get a separate credit rating and
borrow funds without affecting other units.
     In its filing, PG&E said creditors may try to link payments
between the utility and the parent to $349 million in capital
contributions that PG&E made to National Energy Group in 2000,
including $250 million transferred in the fourth quarter. National
Energy Group's investment grade credit ratings, which were
affirmed following Pacific Gas's April 6 bankruptcy, were based on
the assumption that the new structure insulated the assets.
     ``Bankruptcy law is designed to scrutinize the transactions
between the company and those with inside influence that took
place before the bankruptcy filing,'' Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard
Law School professor, said prior to the filing. ``You do that so
creditors can be compensated.''
     On Feb. 20, Moody's Investors Service gave the National
Energy Group an investment grade long-term rating of ``Baa2.'' The
ratings company said the company's legal structure and independent
financing strategy protect it from PG&E creditors that may attempt
to force a consolidation or bankruptcy.

                    Insolvent Transfers

     Under the federal bankruptcy laws, when a company that's
insolvent transfers assets to a parent and gets less than fair
value, the bankruptcy court can unwind the transaction. The court
can also undo asset transfers intended either to defraud
creditors.
     PG&E said it couldn't assure that fraudulent transfer claims
in Pacific Gas's Chapter 11 case wouldn't be successful. If any
such claims do succeed, they may have a significantly adverse
impact, the company said. PG&E said it thinks Pacific Gas was
solvent when it made payments to the parent and that creditors
hadn't been defrauded.
     In some circumstances, bankruptcy judges can undo corporate
restructurings. In this case, National Energy Group's assets could
be lumped with its parent's and used to pay off creditors.
     PG&E said such a combination of assets, known as substantive
consolidation, ``is an exception rather than the rule.''
     Another risk is the possibility that California regulators
may try and rescind payments that PG&E made to National Energy
Group, the parent said in the filing.
     The California Public Utilities Commission began an
investigation of intercompany payments between all parts of the
PG&E corporate structure on April 3.
     The filing disclosed that National Energy Group has more than
$2.22 billion of short- and long-term debt, including debt to its
parent, as of Dec. 31.
     PG&E owns all the stock of the National Energy Group, which
it used as collateral for a $1 billion loan arranged by General
Electric Capital Corp. and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. If PG&E
defaults on the loan, control of the company would move to the
creditors, which may cause a default under certain obligations of
the National Energy Group, the filing said.

Fred,

Attached is the regulatory timeline that you requested for the FCC 
presentation.  I left a hard copy for you with Rosie in the event that you 
make it into the office tomorrow (which I heard you intend to do).   Safe 
travels and let me know if you have any questions.

Lara

Rick, I am attaching a bio on Glen.  He is Trent Lott and Thad
Cochrans appointee and has done a great job at TVA.  TVA is now
without a chairman.  It is my opinion that things will move much
slower if President Bush does not appoint a chairman.  Mcculough
is the right person.  He has told me that if the president wants
to put another person as chairman after he or she is cleared
through the process then he will step down.  This process will
take six month or more.  I am told that there might have been an
offer for acting Chairman, but this would not be a good idea.  I
would appreciate any help.  Please keep me informed.  Johnny

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late 
yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of 
quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the 
past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the 
Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

*PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
BANKRUPTCY RELIEF


NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
District of California. 

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 

The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is 
authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court." 

A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
power costs to consumers.

Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore ("why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?"), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's "past" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's "net short" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's "going forward costs" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.

Gary -- 

Attached are some suggested talking points for your meeting with Chairman 
Newsome from the CFTC.   I would suggest that we generally discuss our 
interest in the ag business, without committing to any particular business 
model or targeted industry segment.    In addition, we should express our 
desire to work with the CFTC to develop rules for ag commodities which 
encourage the development of innovative, customized risk management 
products.   

I plan to sit in the meeting with you.   

Thanks for your help.

Lisa

We have known for some time that Gray Davis is a much better fundraiser and
political spin doctor than he is a Governor, but lately he is taking the
spin way too far. He is so desperate to find villains with whom he can
deflect focus from his own record that he continues to ignore facts. Here is
my effort to set the record straight on several of the Governor's, and his
lackeys, recent 
pronouncements on energy and the budget. 
Energy:
MYTH:  "All Texans are evil"
His spokesman said, "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have
handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind." 
Why he said it: George Bush is from Texas and is a convenient scapegoat.
FACT: Only 2 of the 12 largest energy suppliers to California are from Texas
and they provide only 9% of the state's energy use.  

MYTH:  "Private power generators charged California the most"
Governor Davis said, "What's going on here, pure and simple, is
unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers."
Why he said it: Polls show that it is easier to blame power generators for
the energy crisis than anyone else. FACT: The private company power
generators charged substantially lower prices over the last few months for
energy than the public agencies.  In fact, documents recently released
reveal that Enron and Mirant averaged $181 and $225 per megawatt while LADWP
and Sacramento Municipal averaged $292 and $330 for energy sold to the state
during the first quarter of this year.  

MYTH:  "Power companies manipulated prices" 
Governor Davis said,  "Their testimony could be the "smoking gun" that
demonstrates there was improper manipulation of California's electricity
market."  
Why he said it: another way to say, "its not my fault, its their fault"
FACT: Duke energy shut its plant down because it was ordered to, in order to
balance the grid, by the California ISO, an entity overseen entirely by
Davis appointees. 
Budget:
MYTH:  "Republicans want to cut education spending"
A lead education appointee said, "We feel very strongly that agreeing to
that would put us in a position where children would lose." Why it was said:
he needs to think of something to justify his tax increase. FACT:
Republicans have never proposed cuts in education out of the current budget.
We have instead proposed reducing pork, entirely new or expanded 
programs, and cutting funded but vacant bureaucratic positions. 

MYTH:  "The $1.2 billion sales tax increase is not a tax increase"
The Governor said, "They've just invented this argument about a tax
increase. It's just nonsense. It's not a tax increase." 
Why he said it: he wants to maintain the illusion of being a fiscal
conservative FACT: One year ago, when the sales tax was cut, Davis had a
news conference announcing "This tax decrease will benefit every
Californian.  It will put even more of our prosperity in the hands of those
who created it in the first place - the taxpayers of this State." Now, when
the same tax goes up, it is not a tax increase? 
I will let you figure out for yourself whether or not these myths are indeed
myths -- I only hope that you won't be using the Governor's statements for
your facts.

Until next week, that's all for this week.

In the Commission's March 29 order, it has identified the following 5 basic 
policy issues that need to be addressed in the proceeding:

Method for calculating unbundled costs, comprising such issues as the 
appropriate methods for performing embedded cost studies, especially the 
assignment of indirect costs;
Method for performing forward-looking incremental cost studies;
Rate treatment that should be accorded stranded costs or competitive losses;
Degree of statewide consistency in defining utility functions, assigning 
costs, and defining customer classifications that is needed to promote the 
development of a retail market;
Functional areas to which utility costs should be assigned and to distinguish 
those functional areas with the most promise of becoming competitive.

In a subsequent Procedural Ruling, the ALJ asked parties for more specific 
questions and detailed sub-issues under the 5 major issues.  As a result, 
there were over 200 questions/issues submitted to the Staff.  Concerned that 
it would be difficult to answer all the questions in any meaningful way and 
submit for Commission decision by the August deadline, Staff proposes to 
phase-in the proceeding by focusing on issues 1 and 5 first so the utilities 
can begin the embedded cost studies.  The remaining issues will be addressed 
some time after August.  

On a conference call held yesterday (May 21st), utilities expressed their 
strong feeling that all 5 issues needed to be answered before any study could 
be started while ESCOs sided with the Staff.  Staff will submit its 
phasing-in proposal to the ALJ in the May 25 Prehearing Conference and is 
ready to issue guidelines as to how costs should be classified and allocated 
to different functions.

Enron is an active party to the proceeding stand-alone and also through our 
membership in NESPA.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need 
additional information.

Rick - Over the weekend we agreed to terms with PSE&G on a gas case 
requestiung the transfer of pipeline capacity contracts.  In return for our 
support, we obtained the following:
 Two three year gas storage deals with ENA;
 Three year Capacity Management, when Residential customers move to market 
prices, (probably within two-three years);
 5% Basic Generation Service when BGS market opens 8/02.

ENA is currently valueing the gas deals, however, my guess is they are worth 
approximately $3-5 million.  The cap mgt deal will be worth approximately 
$25-30 million, whiule the BGS will be a liitle difficullt to quantify at 
this point.  There was also a general understanding with Steve Teitleman, 
President PSEG Genco, to increase the business between ENA and PS, both in 
power and gas.  

I will forward the LOI when it is signed, probably within a few days.  As 
always please call if you wish to discuss the details.

Colleagues:

I am seeking your help to compile the accomplishment for GA during the period 
Nov 2000 - April 2001.  Of course, these accomplishments are the summation of 
your efforts either individually or through your group, and the total shall 
indicate the contribution of GA to the corporate objectives of Enron.  The 
aggregation of your inputs shall be one of the primary sources that Rick and 
Steve will use in communicating GA impact to all stakeholders in the 
company.  

I would like to suggest to use the attached excel file to document your 
accomplishment for the period.  I hope that it shall assist you to identify 
your contribution, your estimate of value, and a line, or two, explaining the 
methodology you used to arrive at your value.    

I hope to receive your inputs by  May 16th (next Wednesday), so that I can 
compile the inputs and issue the first draft for discussion by Monday 21st.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

To EPSA's Public Affairs & State Issues Committees:

We're just a few companies short of our necessary threshold for launching 
creative and production work for our voluntary paid-media campaign in support 
of the pro-competition lessons from California.

Joining us so far in this effort are: AES NewEnergy, Duke Energy North 
America, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Mirant, NRG Energy and 
Reliant Energy.  We also are coordinating with the Edison Electric 
Institute's third-party earned-media efforts in the Northeast and West, as 
well as with the earned- and paid-media efforts of the Chamber of Commerce 
Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth in support of a new national energy 
policy.

To help expedite the process, we will schedule an initial conference call for 
Thursday, May 24, for the pro-competition campaign funders.  I'll forward the 
call-in details next week to the participants.

We will be reviewing the messages and potential audiences, and get a time 
line for deliverables from Public Strategies Inc.

Thanks to all of you for your consideration and support for this special 
project.

Regards,
Mark S.

One more fyi. 

I prepared this letter as per top management request. Enron needs to make it 
clear what our view is on caps, Annex V, fixing MAE, etc.

Subject: Re: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad

Luiz,

Generally an excellent job.  

I would make a stronger point of the fact that many technical experts (us 
included) believe that cost-of-defecit should be multi-tiered, and that even 
the first tier should be higher.  I also wouldn't concede that changing the 
cost of defecit is a change of the rules.  Nevertheless, leaving it where it 
is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political 
pressures.

I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE: e.g. there is no 
substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price 
signals, credit integrity, and timely cash settlement.  I WOULD NOT make the 
resolution of Angra II a pre-condition for the continuing well-being of the 
MAE.   Let's just get the market working now (e.g. governance, 
penalties/guaranties, accounting) on an ongoing basis; I think that the issue 
of Angra II can be treated separately.

Given the current discussion vis-a-vis the constitutionality of ammending the 
Consumer Protection Code by executive fiat, I agree with your decision to 
avoid the discussion of pass-throughs.

Time is of the essence. 

Ideally,we should send it today.  Parente should get acquainted with the

I think it's a great idea, Luiz.  How about a paper organized around Remi's 
four points with you developing the arguments (such as the argument for 
contract sanctity included in this e-mail chain).  Perhaps Orlando and / or 
Kish could get a meeting with Parente to present the paper and explain how it 
is a comprehensive roadmap to permanently reslove the problem.

I think it is a good idea to state our position on Annex V and to take this 
chance to reaffirm our belief in the following 4 basic principles:

1. Contract sanctity (Annex V holds, all contracts hold)
2. No caps on spot prices (if Brazil still wants to attract private funds in 
new generation)
3. Pass through of MAE price at LDC level for end-user consumption above 
their respective quota
4. Brazil needs MAE to settle: make it work.  Only way: reinforce credit 
worthiness of all MAE members.

Subject: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad faith?


Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called "dry 
period relief" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a "proxy" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
"bullet proof". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument "no one should lose, no one should gain" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

LM

WASHINGTON -- Greg Simon, who spearheaded the cable open-access effort for 
America Online Inc. after leaving the Clinton White House, has signed up to 
lobby for Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trading company with close 
political ties to the Bush Administration. 
Simon -- a top media and telecommunications adviser to former Vice President 
Al Gore and founder of his own lobbying firm, called Simon Strategies -- 
filed a lobbying-registration form with the clerk of the House of 
Representatives on June 18. He also registered Simon Strategies assistants 
Kristan Van Hook and Ann Morton as Enron lobbyists. 
On the form, Simon said he planned to lobby the White House, Congress, the 
Commerce Department and the Federal Communications Commission "in furtherance 
of national policies that support competitive access by content providers to 
broadband communications networks." 
Simon declined to discuss his Enron duties, except to say  he was lobbing for 
the company directly, indicating that Enron was not joining Simon's OpenNet 
coalition -- the group once funded by AOL to pressure the FCC and Congress to 
impose open Internet access mandates on the cable industry. 
"I am not registered to do [Enron's] press for them," Simon said in a phone 
interview. "You have to talk to them about what they want to say to the 
press. That's not what they want me to do unless they give me the go-ahead to 
do that." 
Enron is a $100 billion energy company with a broadband-services division. 
The company signed a video-on-demand deal with Blockbuster Inc., which 
collapsed in March with each side blaming the other for the venture's 
failure. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay is a longtime informal adviser to President Bush 
on energy issues. He was one of 212 individuals who each raised $100,000 for 
the Bush campaign, while Enron provided corporate jets for Bush campaign 
officials, according to U.S. News and World Report. 
Wendy L. Gramm, wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), is an Enron board 
director, according to Enron's company Web site. 
U.S. News also reported that Enron employees gave $1.3 million to the GOP 
last year. It also stated that three Bush administration officials -- senior 
adviser Karl Rove, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff I. Lewis Libby, and 
top economic policy adviser Lawrence Lindsey - each owned at least $50,000 in 
Enron stock, though Rove has moved to sell the shares. 
Sources said Simon is planning to revive the open-access issue on behalf of 
Enron and The Walt Disney Co. and perhaps expand the effort to include 
nondiscrimination by cable operators against unaffiliated 
interactive-television providers. Enron did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. 
A Disney official has repeatedly said that the company has made no decision 
about joining any open-access or ITV coalition. 
A source who recently met with Simon said the lobbyist indicated his Enron 
job would deal with open access to cable facilities. 
"What he said suggested to me that he has had conversations with [Enron and 
Disney], and it does seem that those companies have something in common on 
open access," the sources said. 
Another source said Enron, which owns an 18,000-mile global fiber-optic 
network, was looking to deliver content from that plant to end users over the 
last mile controlled by cable and phone companies. 
"Their interest is, essentially, access to the local loop," the source said. 
Cable industry sources said they were puzzled by Simon's latest move and 
didn't have a clear sense of where he would begin to apply pressure.
One cable industry wag quipped, "Enron is a major content provider of oil, 
gas and electricity." 
All Simon would say is that he is "representing Enron Broadband directly. 
Anything more, you have to talk to Enron about. I make it a habit not to put 
words in my client's mouth."

I spoke with Donna Bobbish this morning about Steve's question -- does the 
President have broader authority to take action during times of crisis.  
Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.  
Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked 
Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, 
and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended 
beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.  

We will let you know what we learn from that further research.

Sarah:  In response to Steve's inquiry, I did look into this question
briefly when you first gave me the assignment.  I read an interesting law
review article  on "The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States," for
a discussion of presidential powers.  There is no general emergency
authority granted the President in the U.S.  Constitution.  Also, the
article discussed the famous "Truman steel mills case," Youngstown Sheet &
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the
Korean War.  In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in
the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national
defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to
take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.  The
Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such  an
action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the
Constitution itself.  Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure
authority, it invalidated the President's action.  The Supreme Court also
rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be
implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.

Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of
action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute
which might prove useful.

I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be
entering "martial law-type" legal territory, where the President would be
acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (which
has been described a "zone of twilight"), and in light of the Truman steel
mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more.  Thank you.

The news that we are buying the "Pliego" may be mis-interpreted that Enron is 
changing its posture and -- those crazy people in Enron South America are 
going back purchasing assets.

Mike wants to buy the document to analyze how Enron my be able to participate 
in this market. He has made it clear to the local officials that we do not 
intend to buy the distribution wires. Please pass the word if it comes up.

We have just completed our review the Epec distribution assets and the final 
meeting with senior representatives of the Epec privatisation. We have 
concluded there is limited value in Enron pursuing the regulated wires 
business but also that there is potential value in Epec's generation assets 
such as the Rio Grande Peaking Unit and other commercial opportunities in 
Cordoba. To this end we are purchasing the distribution pliego of Epec to 
gather pertinent energy market information. 

In the next week you may see Enron being listed as a purchaser of the Epec 
pliego. To avoid any confusion,  particularly for our Argentine employees,  I 
am informing all of you of our commercial intentions are still to pursue the 
peaking assets and other commercial opportunities in Cordoba. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rick - 

Attached is a Resources Spreadsheet for our meeting tomorrow afternoon.  The 
spreadsheet is broken out by Cost Center and lists employee name, project the 
employee is working on, and the business unit affected (if known).  There is 
also a column for prob. of success that I thought would be filled out at the 
meeting.  The information on this spreadsheet is taken from the monthly 
reports (that I have worked on or have received) and the old IRTF report 
submitted.  I also spoke to Ricardo who gave me his projects.  I've worked 
with Jim Steffes, Sue Nord, and Lisa Yoho on the preparation of their monthly 
reports.  I know that Jim's report went out yesterday but I haven't seen the 
final version.  You should receive the final report for Sue and Lisa this 
week.  Please advise if the information on the attached spreadsheet meets our 
needs for tomorrow.  I can make changes in the morning.  I've got to work on 
Lisa's report in the morning and finalize the presentation for Friday.  I 
think Lisa left you a voice mail about the training program.  The slides are 
done for the presentation and I need to write what I'm going to say.  I think 
that's it for now.  Sorry if this rambles.

Eric

Hedy spoke to Senator Burton who informed her that he is deferring to
Senator Sher on the bonding language for the moment, but that Senator Sher
has not agreed to the language which is currently in Legislative Counsel.
If Senator Sher does approve the language, Senator Burton will have the bill
sent through the normal committee process versus sending it right to the
floor.  The bill is not going to refer to a DRC, but instead "will talk
about set-asides."  According to Burton, the language will not be
distributed until Sher approves it.   We will present Enron's proposed
amendments to Sher if he decides to proceed.

NDN

Senator Bingaman (D-NM) chaired the New Democratic Network (NDN) energy 
breakfast this morning. He told me he was looking forward to meet with Ken 
later in the day.   He talked about how his Committee plans to proceed, 
beginning with the release today to Senators of a document that identifies 
issues that were included in both the Murkowski and Bingaman drafts of energy 
legislation.  He hopes to make this the starting point for bipartisan 
comprehensive legislation.
Bob Simon, Committee Staff Director, told me he was interested in working 
with Enron.

After Sen. Bingaman departed, Reps. Cal Dooley (D-CA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Adam 
Smith (D-WA), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) talked about the New Dems energy plan.  
They restated their intent to focus on policy and not the rhetoric being 
spread by the Democratic Leadership.  They also say they want a "goal" to 
reach, for instance, energy independence by 2020.    I mentioned open access 
on the electricity grid as a mid-term energy policy goal.

Follow up:  I spoke to Rep. John Larson's staff about our investment in  fuel 
cell technology in Connecticut.  They called and want to meet with us next 
Wednesday.

DLC 

The DLC is currently considering energy policy and Peter Fox Penner is 
leading the drafting.  They hope to have the plan developed and released in 
the next month or so. Their proposal will focus on the following issues: 

The pre-California regulatory environment clearly did not work as it should.  
How can we improve FERC, state and local regulatory regimes to avoid another 
California.

Mandate a "Clean Quarter":  Ensure that at least a quarter of all new energy 
production come from "clean" energy  sources defined by low emissions 
output.  The goal is to increase renewable energy, but it is unrealistic to 
deny the need for fossil fuels.  So the DLC would look to mandate renewables 
and cleaner burning fossil fuels.

Encourage deregulation and competition,  through support and transition 
funds.  The goals is to ease the transition into deregulate markets and the 
volatility that often accompany such a transition.  Create investment funds 
(like a Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) to make a move to competitive markets 
easier and less threatening.

Create a market to tradeable Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard 
units.

 On transmission, the DLC would expand transmission by creating binding 
Regional Electricity Siting Compacts that would ease eminent domain issues.

4P and 3P trading programs.  The DLC would support efforts  to expand 
emissions trading beyond S02, to NO2 and Mercury (and possibly CO2).  I spoke 
to Pat Shortridge and Lisa Jacobsen and will offer them up to the DLC as 
experts on these programs.

Full-scale reexamination of Nuclear as a viable energy source.

Encourage real-time pricing to avoid reliance on spot markets.

Mandate new buildings be constructed "smart" and provide incentives to 
encourages large industrials and buildings to outsource their energy needs.  


Follow up:  The DLC is going to look to Enron for ideas on how to structure 
these proposals over the coming weeks.  Perhaps Rick Shapiro could spend some 
time with Peter Fox Penner and Will Marshall when he is in town next week.

Scheduled blackout plan gaining favor
LIMITING PRICES: 3-state buyers' cartel with Northwest could create leverage

Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Thursday, May 17, 2001

More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers -- that's a deal 
looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer 
advocates.

The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the 
cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, is for the state to set a firm ceiling 
on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not 
one dime more.

The trade-off would be certain blackouts, possibly more than if the state 
continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.

Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of 
blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by 
scheduling service interruptions.

"We need to stop this game of electricity chicken," said Michael Shames, 
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, which first proposed the 
idea. "We are likely to see blackouts this summer; we should use them to our 
advantage rather than be victimized by them."

The plan calls for creating a "buyers' cartel" of California, Oregon and 
Washington. Essentially, the states would decide at what price they were 
willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level.

The state has spent $6 billion on energy purchases since January, and at one 
point during last week's power shortage was spending $1,900 per megawatt hour 
-- more than 10 times what Davis has planned on for this summer. That kind of 
spending cannot go on, Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek 
said yesterday.

"The question is, can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the 
state maintain economic stability? I believe the answer is no," said Keeley, 
the lower house's main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that 
put the state in the power-buying business.

"To get this problem solved, we have to think in bold terms," said Keeley, 
who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul 
Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel.


THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE
Davis said last week that "my bias would be to keep the lights on at any 
price." But yesterday, the governor said a temporary price limit is 
"certainly a matter we've talked about and considered at some length. The 
next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond 
to it."

A spokesman for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being 
considered. Calls to the office of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber were not 
returned.

The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe, as many state officials 
do, that California is being gouged for electricity.

"I can see if our bills were $20 or $30 more, but this is ridiculous," said 
Kimberly Chambers, an 18-year-old fashion design student from Oakland. 
"Whatever it takes, I don't think we should have to pay for more."

But Yunah Kim, 36, who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago, said 
blackouts should not even be considered.

"The infrastructure of government is coming apart, and it's the basic service 
government is able to provide," she said. "Businesses are not going to put up 
with that. It's very shortsighted. We just have to pay until there's a 
solution."

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute 
in Berkeley, said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits 
believe.

"I think they (power companies) would call our bluff," and sell their 
electricity elsewhere, Borenstein said. "I don't think the state has the 
ability to credibly commit to paying no more than 'X.' That would be a very 
controversial decision."

Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a 
West Coast buyers cartel. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Dede Alpert, D- 
Coronado, would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power 
if it is too expensive.

The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such 
things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers 
would be built in, supporters said.


LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL
Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts, but that seems unlikely.

"Everybody I talked to -- once you establish that there will be blackouts --

both businesses and residents say, let's have control," Alpert said.

The California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a 
recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21. 
8 billion and 135,000 jobs, is considering whether scheduled interruptions 
would be less harmful.

"The problem if we do (scheduled blackouts) is that we may have an inordinate 
amount of blackouts," said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the group.


NO EASY TASK
The ISO, which runs the state's power grid, is scheduled to issue a report 
tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work.

Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, said that planning blackouts is not as 
easy as it sounds.

"The difficulty is a pragmatic one -- the circuits are not wired to deal with 
choices like we are having to make," said Bowen, who has been holding 
hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts.

"Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box," Bowen said.

***************************************************************
VERIZON PLANS PENNSYLVANIA InterLATA BID
THIS MONTH AFTER PUC GIVES CONDITIONAL SUPPORT

Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., plans to accept conditions that the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission imposed today on its
support for the company's planned application to provide
interLATA (local access and transport area) services in the
state.   The company expects to file its application later this
month with the FCC, which, under the Telecommunications Act of
1996, will consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and the
relevant state regulators before issuing a decision.  The state
regulators' role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company
has complied with the local exchange market-opening mandates of
the Act.

In a 3-2 vote, the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a
permanent performance assurance plan with "self-executing"
remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC.
The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of
the PUC's authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing
backsliding on local exchange market-opening commitments.  The
PUC said the company must agree to increase certain penalties
from $5,000 to $25,000.  And the commission said Verizon must
agree to increase remedies for failing to provide accurate
electronic billing to competitors; the company could face
payments as high as $100,000 per affected competitive local
exchange carrier for missing an electronic billing standard.

Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J. Fitzpatrick
dissented.  Commissioner Brownell said, "I cannot, in good
conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned
under the Act."  Both dissenting commissioners listed several
areas in which Verizon had failed to show that local markets are
open to competition.  But Colleen McCloskey, senior vice
president-state government relations and external affairs at
Verizon, said she believed those concerns were addressed by the
conditions the PUC laid out.

Ms. McCloskey noted that New York, Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania comprise the lion's share of Verizon Communications,
Inc.'s access lines.  Verizon already is providing interLATA
service in New York and Massachusetts.  Winning approval in
Pennsylvania would mean the company is making substantial
progress toward meeting an FCC requirement for Verizon's
regaining control of Internet backbone service provider Genuity,
Inc.  Verizon spun that unit off last year as a condition of the
FCC's approval of a merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.,
which formed Verizon.

A WorldCom, Inc., spokesman told TR, "We agree with the [PUC]
dissenters.  We hope the FCC will recognize that problems still
exist and force Verizon to fix them prior to allowing it to offer
long distance."

NEW COMMISSIONER ABERNATHY SEEKS MEETINGS WITH LAWMAKERS

FCC Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy, still in her first week
on the job, already is sending letters to members of Congress
seeking meetings to discuss the Commission's work.  In an
interview today with TR, she said she viewed her new role as an
interpreter of Congress's statutory mandate.  The public never
has a chance to vote for FCC Commissioners, unlike members of
Congress, she noted.

Many of the predictions and assumptions made about the pace of
technological and market change when the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 was passed were wrong, Ms. Abernathy said.  But that
doesn't mean the Act has been a failure, she added.  She cited
increasing choices for consumers as one of the positive gains
made since 1996.

The commissioner, who was director-government affairs at
Broadband Office, Inc., emphasized the importance of information
provided by Congress, industry officials, consumer groups, and
state regulators.  Despite her experience in various industry
segments, she's "not an engineer or an economist," she said.  She
appreciates organized presentations and creative ideas, she
added.

See Monday's TR for a full transcript of the interview.

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CHALLENGE FCC's ANTENNA LICENSING
PROCEDURES

Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCC's
antenna licensing process, saying the agency should assess the
"direct, indirect, and cumulative effects" before issuing new
licenses.  Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation
Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny
33 antenna license applications.

The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those
projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Council of Envi-
ronmental Quality regulations, and FCC rules.  In addition,
applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered
Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act, the groups allege.

The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas
dismiss the charges.  They say their applications fully comply
with applicable regulations.  The environmental groups fail to
provide any specific justification or evidence against their
projects and lack standing in the proceeding, the companies say.
The groups' challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking
proceeding, they add.

"Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate good-faith
challenges to environmental compliance," American Tower L.P. said
in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower.
"Complaints as vague, insubstantial, and deficient as those in
the present petition, however, are unfair, waste already strained
compliance resources of both Commission and applicants, and can
cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to [the]
overall industry, through unnecessary construction delay and
regulatory uncertainty."

A spokeswoman for the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
said today that agency officials were reviewing the environmental
groups' petitions.

TIA PARTNERS WITH USAID TO BOOST OVERSEAS TELECOM SALES

The Telecommunications Industry Association has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) to help U.S. telecom equipment
vendors increase sales in developing countries.  USAID will
provide access to its "global technology network" (GTN), which
assists U.S. small and midsize companies by matching prospective
buyers and sellers.

TIA said the agreement should increase the volume of new business
leads and deals in emerging markets.  "TIA and GTN share the
common goals of promoting economic development through business
enterprise," said TIA President Matthew Flanigan.

The technology industry last year experienced its slowest growth
rate since 1994-1995, according to a report released today by AeA
(formerly the American Electronics Association).  The
"Cyberstates 2001" report "confirms that the current high-tech
slowdown began in 2000," AeA President William T. Archey said.
"And many current indicators point to a continued slowing of
growth for 2001.  Yet despite the present economic uncertainty,
some states have flourished," he said.  The 160-page report found
that all states, except for West Virginia, experienced growth in
high-tech employment between 1999 and 2000.  For more
information, go to AeA's Web site, http://www.aeanet.org, or call

 FYI - a  joint letter from the IMO and OEB confirming their intention to 
proceed with market readiness by the Fall of 2001.                          
As I indicated earlier to Richard, I have been invited to a meeting with 
several people from the Premier's office on Wednesday  May 2  to discuss the 
announcement ( I have asked Paul Devries to accompany me; representatives 
from Centrica, Toronto Hydro and Enersource/Mississauga Hydro will be there 
as well).                                        I had dinner with Judy 
Hubert (Asst Deputy Minister of Energy whom John met at Ken Lay's speech) on 
Thursday evening: she was aware of the pending meeting between Premier Harris 
and Mr. Lay  and was enquiring about what Mr. Lay wanted to address - I 
indicated that Mr. Lay would want to make the case for opening the market in 
the Fall of 2001(as set out in his speech) and to share with the Premier some 
proposals for moving the matter forward. I also indicated that Mr. Lay would 
be able to provide the Premier with a useful  and honest perspective on the 
events in California and that hopefully , on a going forward basis, the 
Premier would see Mr. Lay as someone he could phone and talk to about those 
issues.  I will sketch out a draft of the proposed speaking points early next 
week.

TURKEY ABOLISHES THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO IMPORT NATURAL GAS

The gas bill's passage into Turkish law in May has far-reaching consequences
for international power developers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers into
Turkey, and incumbent players. CERA identifies two critical consequences
emerging from the new legislation:

*  Power developers may be able to renegotiate their gas supply agreements.

*  More opportunities for LNG suppliers will emerge.

The following came from an anonymous mother in Austin, TX. Let's just

say she has an interesting life with very imaginative children.

=20

Things I've learned from my children (Honest and No Kidding):

1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq foot house

4 inches deep.

2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller

blades, they can ignite.

3. A 3-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded

restaurant.=20

4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong

enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman

cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of

a 20X20 foot room.

5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When

using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few

times before you get a hit.=20

5a. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.

6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit

by a ceiling fan.

7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words "Uh-oh", it's already

too late.

8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.

9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a

36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying

glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.

10. Certain Lego's will pass through the digestive tract of a

four-year-old.

11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.

12. Super glue is forever.

13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't

walk on water.

14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O.

15. VCR's do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show they
do.

16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.

17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.

18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is.

19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not

like ovens.

20. The fire department in Austin has a 5 minute response time.

21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms

dizzy. It will however make cats dizzy and cats throw up twice their

body weight when dizzy.

Rick -- This is a string of e-mails regarding the ISU/Illinois Power issue.  
We did confirm by onsite inspection that the units in question are 
electrically isolated from the utility and therefore do not require standby 
service as mandated by IP.

Tim ... this email is to confirm our conversation from earlier this evening.

Before the SC 21 agreement is executed/sent to Illinois Power Co., the 
proposal to raise the issue of ISU's right of ability to use backup 
generators before the Illinois Commerce Commission should be reviewed with 
the (EES) Office of the Chairman.  

Although this will delay the process, we need to make sure we do not conflict 
with any initiatives, or other efforts of which we may not be aware.  

If you have any questions, pls page me at 888-948-5919.

Potential financial impact to EES, given the various actions IP may take.

Subject: ISU and IP

Tim and Marc -- I have looked over Conrad Siudyla's May 31, 2001 letter to 
you and have the following comments.  First, he is patently threatening the 
customer and Enron that if the self-gen units are parallel or regularly run 
as peak shavers ( "IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all 
generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated 
and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving") 
standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the 
contract.  Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak 
shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us.  It is imperative that we have 
our rights straight: 
 First, that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel;
 Second, that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the 
ICC; and
 Third, that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its self-gen 
units as peak shavers.

 Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer 
that the units are truly isolated. The customer will need to run its units to 
peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will 
trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously.
 The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the 
Commission now.  We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IP's tariffs in 
a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customer's (and hence 
Enron's as agent) rights under the tariffs.

I have had some initial discussions with the US Consul General here, 
following up on his lunch with Ken Lay on April 4, and will be meeting 
tomorrow with two consular officers in the areas of energy and commercial 
relations.  Evidently the Consul General  - and I am led to believe  the new 
Ambassador  -  are  now prepared to weigh in on the market opening issue - 
precisely how, we will find out tomorrow.   The meeting is at 10:00am EST and 
I have contacted  Linda in the hope that some one from the Washington office  
can join in the discussion.   I will fax you all down the recent press 
articles about recent remarks by Cheney and the Premier in Toronto about the 
value to the US of generation development in Ontario.  Aleck

I attended the hearings on PGE's two cash collateral motions today.  Both 
were granted on an interim basis.  The court set a final hearing for May 9 at 
9:30 am.  PGE is to file its pleadings by April 20 and any opposition is due 
by May 4.

The bondholder cash collateral motion was heard first.  There was no 
opposition and the bond trustee (Bank of New York) consented to the relief.  
BONY and PGE are working on a final cash collateral stipulation.

Next was the gas supplier motion.  PGE mentioned in its presentation that the 
basis of the pre-petition agreement was the waiver of termination rights in 
the event of bankruptcy by the suppliers in return for a security interest in 
the receivables.  Jim Lopes, PGE's lawyer, mentioned that he had learned a 
great deal about Bankruptcy Code section 556 in the last few months.  Judge 
Montali nodded his head at that comment.  Montali also asked whether PGE 
conceded that 556 applied.  Lopes answered that he did not concede that it 
applied, but he was "very concerned."

I asked whether the post-petition security interest was available to 
suppliers that were not parties to the pre-petition agreements.  The Court 
said that was up to PGE; Lopes said they were willing to talk about it, but 
they did not want to grant liens to all of their creditors and hoped 
creditors would rely on their administrative claims, which PGE believes will 
be paid in the ordinary course.  Procedurally, the Court said it would not 
authorize any new security interests on the basis of the interim order 
resulting from today's hearing.  Instead, that would have to be the subject 
of a separate motion with notice, and perhaps coujld be taken up at the final 
hearing.
P
 GE also indicated that it is filing today a lawsuit against the CPUC seeking 
a TRO regarding a deadline of April 11 for the filing of certain advice 
letters.  A hearing is tentatively scheduled on the TRO for 3 pm tomorrow, 
April 10.

There was also discussion of various administrative matters, like scheduling 
hearings, entering a case management order, etc.

A representative of a consumer group, the Coalition for Public Power, read a 
statement asking Judge Montali to rollback rates and to force PGE's parent to 
pay the utility's debts.  The Judge let them speak, but made it clear that it 
was not an action item, and seemed generally to ignore them.

The courtroom was packed with attorneys, journalists and members of the 
public.  After the hearing, the reporters all descended upon the attorneys 
for PGE and the CPUC.  The courtroom is in an office building in SF's 
financial district; there were probably ten TV cameras set up on the sidewalk 
as well as several protesters carrying signs.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to 
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson 
(Published June 3, 2001) 

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of 
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a 
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when 
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature 
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer, 
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply 
over demand amounting to some 30 percent. 
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive 
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and, 
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new 
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and 
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce. 
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in 
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of 
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of 
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage 
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date 
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of 
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for 
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone. 

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California 
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy 
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers 
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that 
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply. 
That's why I signed it. 
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 -- 
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which, 
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the 
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation. 
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less 
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity 
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity 
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power 
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction 
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to 
become a state fiscal crisis. 
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I 
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on 
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he 
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two 
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state 
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has 
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state 
budget. 
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in 
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which 
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or 
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in 
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting 
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century. 
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible 
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot 
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a 
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem. 
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could 
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of 
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including 
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers 
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I 
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los 
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead 
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required 
by law. 
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the 
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned 
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at 
the time of enactment. 
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the 
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers. 
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish 
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early 
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so 
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly 
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow 
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and 
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither 
reliable nor affordable. 
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier: 
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to 
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it. 
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the 
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full 
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could 
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become. 
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast 
enough to avoid blackouts this summer. 
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern 
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink. 
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels. 
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from 
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California 
employers to their states and steal our jobs. 
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will 
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it 
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to 
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's 
present crisis. 
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government 
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's 
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create 
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers 
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have 
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that 
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest. 
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of 
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the 
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the 
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just 
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition 
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election. 
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him 
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and 
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in 
order to shift the blame for his own inaction. 

Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).  I do not know if 
the IPPs are still required to become Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs), but 
will check on that.  EWG approval takes 60 days (plus filing preparation 
time).

The Enron Industrial group may want to consider making a similar type of 
filing.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32756-2001Jun6.html Steel 
Lobbyists Gain the Edge
In persuading President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps 
this week aimed at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel 
industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states 
would lose their health insurance if their companies closed.

The specter of an uprising by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber 
active steelworkers, provided a potent political argument for the industry's 
case that Bush should take drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies 
from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image.

The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. 
Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom has been receiving $45,0!
00!
a month from an industry-union coalition called Stand Up for Steel.

The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his 
administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission 
seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports. And although many 
factors went into the White House's decision, industry sources and other 
participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a 
classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an 
administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular 
vote.

"From a political perspective, this was not a hard case to make to a 
government as closely divided as this one is," said Weber, a former 
congressman, in an interview. Eighteen steel companies are "in one stage or 
another of bankruptcy. All those retirees are facing loss of benefits."

Only about 150,000 people now work in U.S. steel facilities, but at some of 
the biggest integrated steel!
ma!
kers -- which are in the worst trouble financially -- there are about six 
retirees for every active worker. (The total number of retirees is slightly 
more than 300,000, according to industry officials).

Adding to the political punch behind the Gillespie-Weber argument was the 
fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly 
contested in the last presidential election, including Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia. The most fiercely contested state of all -- 
Florida -- is among the top eight states  in number of retirees.

A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry, Lewis Leibowitz of the law 
firm Hogan & Hartson, ruefully gave credit to his opponents' political skill. 
Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition, which 
consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import 
competition helps keep costs low.

"They did a lot, obviously," Leibowitz said, referring to Gillespie and 
Weber. "This is an!
i!
ndustry that has something like 160,000 workers, and the market [value] of 
all the companies is smaller than that of Amazon.com, and they've turned this 
town upside down. So my hat is off to them."

The administration took other considerations into account, to be sure, 
including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for 
congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements.

Jim Dyke, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, asserted that 
his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled 
how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the 1980s only to 
find themselves devastated anew by imports. Foreign steel shipments, which 
account for about 20 percent of the U.S. market, reached record levels after 
financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil in the late 1990s.

"Factories are closing, and people are losing their jobs, because there's not 
a level playing field," Dyke said, repeating the administration's argument!
t!
hat a major reason for the oversupply of steel on world markets is the 
subsidies that many foreign countries provided when they established their 
national industries. "This fits in with the president's free-trade strategy."

Capitalizing on the administration's decision, Evans joined in a news 
conference/rally yesterday with such top labor leaders as John Sweeney, 
president of the AFL-CIO, and Leo Gerard, president of the United 
Steelworkers of America, both of whom backed Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 
presidential race.

"You can trust that we will be with you every step of the way until the 
problem is fixed," Evans told the cheering crowd, which was reminded by other 
speakers that the Clinton administration had balked at filing a case like the 
one Bush intends to bring before the International Trade Commission. (The 
Clinton administration, along with a number of industry lawyers, feared 
losing the case at the time, but industry experts said another factor was the 
staunch fr!
ee!
-trade stance of the Treasury Department.)

The Bush administration itself has balked at taking action that would 
directly protect the benefits of steel retirees. The steelworkers union has 
called for the government to create a fund that would help cover these  
"legacy costs," but administration officials said their moves to block 
imports should help protect benefits by aiding the industry's revival.

The White House will now have to contend with the ire of U.S. trading 
partners, which have reacted with a mixture of indignation and restraint. 
Long Tong Yu, China's top trade official, told a news conference at a trade 
meeting in Zhouzhuang yesterday that although "China is concerned with any 
protectionist practices or measures,"  it would wait to see whether the U.S. 
action conformed with the rules of the World Trade Organization.

Akira Chihaya, president of Nippon Steel Corp. and the head of Japan's Iron 
and Steel Federation, lashed out at the United States, saying he fears!
t!
he administration's move "will encourage protectionism, which has been 
spreading globally."

But U.S. steel industry sources were crowing over the importance of a 
professed free-trade president putting his imprimatur on an ambitious 
initiative to save the industry. "He must be choking, but he wants to win 
elections," one industry official said.

Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate 
unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities 
falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA") and the 
provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives 
transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product 
innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. 
Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product 
innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal 
certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an 
over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading 
platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.

Bilateral Transactions

Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than 
agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a 
multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as 
the transactions are entered solely between "eligible contract 
participants"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital 
thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially 
codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward 
contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has 
frustrated product innovation and growth.  

Multilateral Transactions

In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or 
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as 
they the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", are 
entered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on a 
multi-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansion 
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal 
requirements will have to be met.

Other Transactions

The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are 
of interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weather 
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet 
certain legal thresholds.

This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective 
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have 
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a 
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not 
hesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459 
with any questions.

Victory:

In a rehearing order issued yesterday in the complaint proceeding on El 
Paso's capacity allocation methodology at Topock, FERC required SoCal Gas to 
share the capacity it was allocated at the SoCal/Topock interconnection on a 
pro rata basis with the replacement shippers to whom it has released capacity 
unless otherwise provided in the release.  ENA currently has about 60,000 
MMBtu/d of released Topock capacity that it acquired from SoCal Gas.  

The initial order in this proceeding required El Paso to reallocate capacity 
among the four interconnects (SoCal, PG&E, Mojave, and Southwest Gas)  that 
make up the Topock delivery point.  El Paso's previous policy aggregated the 
four interconnects for the purpose of contracting for firm deliveries.  
Shippers thus had contractual firm rights to deliver about 1,555 MMcf/d to 
SoCal/Topock, but the physical capacity of the interconnect is only 540 
MMcf/d.  Because the best market prices are at the SoCal/Topock point, 
shippers nominate their full entitlements to SoCal/Topock, resulting in 
continual cuts and uncertainty in the marketplace.  

In compliance with the initial order, each firm shipper made a one-time 
election of the specific Topock point that it desired as a primary delivery 
point.  Not surprisingly, all selected SoCal/Topock, and El Paso then 
allocated primary rights on a pro rata basis.  SoCal Gas was allocated 
489,822 Mcf/d at all the Topock points, but only 202,218 Mcf/d at 
SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas then advised ENA and other replacement shippers that 
their capacity would be designated for primary delivery at the Mojave/Topock 
point.  ENA's capacity therefore became significantly less valuable.  

ENA protested El Paso's report to FERC on the allocation process in which it 
provided for the releasing shippers to designate the delivery point 
entitlements of their replacement shippers.  Cook Inlet also requested 
rehearing of the initial order, and  Duke Energy Trading and Marketing filed 
in support of ENA and Cook Inlet.  FERC's order yesterday means that ENA will 
get primary delivery rights at SoCal/Topock for at least a pro rata portion 
of its released capacity.

The revised allocations will be effective April 1, 2001.

Opportunity:

The order also requires El Paso to file, within 30 days, in its Order 637 
proceeding a proposal addressing systemwide capacity allocation issues, 
presumably assigning specific mainline and delivery point capacity rights and 
possible pathing of the entire system.  Parties to the Order 637 proceeding 
will then have 20 days to file comments.

This gives us the opportunity to address the EES problem in Arizona involving 
deliveries (or lack thereof) to customers behind Southwest Gas.

AES has already invested US$6 billion in Brazil, primarily in electricity
projects, making it one of the country's top private foreign investors.

Energy Blackouts To Begin June 1
The government announced Tuesday that it will begin a policy of programmed
blackouts starting June 1 as part of its energy rationing plan.
Mines and Energy Ministry officials had at first hoped to delay any blackou=

incentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is=

to lower
electricity consumption by 20%.
Although the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t=

details have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government
ministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new
meeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem=

The initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for
industry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The

The principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the

The Senate Energy Committee held an oversight hearing today on siting 
impediments to energy infrastructure.  The four witnesses were Jerry 
Halvorsen of INGAA, William Nugent of Maine for NARUC, David Cook, general 
counsel of NERC, and Stan Szwed, vp-transmission of FirstEnergy Corp.  The 
hearing was well attended by committee Republicans, but only Sen. Bingaman 
and Sen. Landrieu on the Democratic side, and then only briefly.

Highlights

NARUC's Nugent urged the Committee to move swiftly to confirm Wood and 
Brownell to FERC, noting their confirmation hearing is tomorrow.

Consensus that energy infrastructure is not able to keep up with projected 
energy demand, both gas and electric.

Surprising willingness (even among western Republican senators who are 
normally pro-states rights, pro-private property rights) that Congress should 
at least seriously consider, if not implement, some form of federal authority 
over power transmission siting.  Specifics were not nailed down, with some 
senators expressing more support for treating electric like FERC already has 
power over natural gas, while others were inclined more toward a FERC back 
stop or last resort authority when state decisionmaking breaks down.  The 
drift was certainly toward some enhanced federal role.

NERC released is Summer Assessment today that is more pessimistic than 
California ISO on the extent of expected rolling blackouts and shortages this 
summer.  NERC seees a capacity shortage in the Pacific Northwest this 
winter.  While NY/NE is adequate this summer, Cook says it bears watching 
because of bouts of high heat in the region and a high level of unplanned 
outages that often occur in the region in the summer.

Chairman Murkowski engaged in a series of questions with INGAA's Halvorsen 
designed to lay the blame for the natural gas capacity problem to California 
and corresponding high price levels on the actions of LDCs in California not 
supporting expansion of interstate pipelines.  Halvorsen's testimony includes 
a chart of specific cases where LDCs intervened.  In his verbal testimony, 
Halvorsen singled out Sempra as a source of opposition, including Sempra 
filings against expansions by Transwestern and Kern River.

Chairman Murkowski got Halvorsen to say that the actions of the California 
LDCs and the intrastate nature of all gas pipelines in California effectively 
denied California consumers the benefit of open access for natural gas.  
Murkowski implied he would entertain a change in the Natural Gas Act as it 
relates to the status of interstate pipelines going in to California.

Sen. Domenici joined the increasing chorus of members of Congress raising 
questions about why natural gas prices are low at the wellhead for his 
producers in New Mexico, but so high into California.  He asked the panel who 
is making the money in the differential, but none of the witnesses wanted to 
tackle the question.  This is just one more indication of the growing 
interest in the natural gas aspects of the California situation.

In a recent organizational memo, I mentioned what a great time this is to b=
e=20
at Enron.  I believe that more strongly than ever, given the new markets we=
=20
are entering, the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou=
nd=20
the world that best fit with our core competencies, and the phenomenal grow=
th=20
of the company, perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first=
=20
quarter.  But, there are challenges as well: California, and its regional a=
nd=20
global implications, and the general market conditions that have brought ou=
r=20
stock price well off its recent highs.  With respect to each of these and=
=20
other challenges, there are invariably opportunities: for example, the=20
enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale=20
electricity markets in the context of California; and, in the context of a=
=20
lower stock price, a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will=
=20
bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future.  One way=
=20
that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit=
=20
more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron.  We in Government=20
Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to=
=20
instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few=20
years.  We have always done our part, but there is always more that can be=
=20
done.

To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, I recently met=
=20
with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government=20
Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively.  We looked at group=
=20
travel costs, outside services, and other budget items.  Attached for your=
=20
review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy,=
=20
which I believe, will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost=
=20
savings.  Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr=
on=20
Europe. (Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied=
,=20
where applicable)

Further, as a result of our review of the budget, we have identified saving=
s=20
across the North American group in excess of 1.5 million dollars (USD).  Th=
is=20
is in addition to almost 2 million dollars (USD) by which the Enron Europe=
=20
Government Affairs budget has been reduced, as well as significant reductio=
ns=20
that have occurred in the South American group. Finally, I have also decide=
d=20
to create a global government affairs hiring committee, which will evaluate=
=20
the need for any proposed hires (new and existing positions).  The purpose =
of=20
the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and, assuming it=
=20
is, determine the most effective way to fill the position.  By encompassing=
 a=20
cross-section of the Government Affairs group globally, it is my hope that =
we=20
will arrive at better hiring decisions.  The hiring committee will consist =
of=20
Aleck Dadson (Toronto), Sue Nord (Houston), Jim Steffes (Houston), Paul=20
Dawson (London), Doug Wood (London), Nick O=01,Day (Tokyo), Sergio Assad (S=
ao=20
Paulo), Linda Robertson (Washington) and myself.   The committee will meet =
on=20
an as needed basis.

I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide=
=20
more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support.=
 =20
I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback.=20

Thank you

EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET LIBERALIZATION: GATHERING PACE

The European Commission has issued two new documents aimed at furthering
liberalization of the European energy market in the second half of the deca=
de.
The Commission has set both quantitative and qualitative objectives for gas=
=20
and
power. France=01,s opposition to the proposals will delay the implementatio=
n of
market opening as envisaged by the Commission. However, in CERA=01,s view t=
he
rejection of the Commission=01,s draft documents is only a temporary slow d=
own in
the process. Liberalization remains a widely shared objective among member
states and is only gathering pace. CERA expects four principal outcomes fro=
m
the ongoing discussions:

* The pace of market opening will accelerate despite French opposition.

* The scope of unbundling will be extended to include separate ownership.

* A unified European approach for grid regulation will emerge.

* Public service obligation will be institutionalized.

Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's 
grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888 
on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a 
grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate 
Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory 
in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are 
asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be 
noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. 
petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  
Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next 
week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials 
developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to 
try to resolve it.  Attached are:

A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last 
week
A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more 
detailed "backgrounder."

If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=

and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=

number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=

with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=

our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Daschle Pledges Bipartisanship As Dems Take Control
Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Daschle today pledged
to pursue bipartisanship and what he called "united governance"
as Democrats took control of the Senate. Daschle and Minority
Leader Lott pledged to work together to conduct business just as
they worked through issues when Republicans held the majority.
Meanwhile, Republicans scaled back their demands for what must be
included in a new organizing resolution - the first major task
facing Democrats and Republicans in their newly reversed roles.
Daschle told reporters he recognized the unique historic nature
of a mid-session shift in power, and said Democrats would strive
to be fair in their dealings with the GOP, often having
criticized Republican rule in the past. "It would be hypocrisy at
its worst if we were going to take the same tactics. We're not
going to do that," said Daschle. "The tenuous nature of our
majority requires that we act accordingly." Lott took a similar
tone, saying: "The good times, we will remember and try to
repeat. The bad times have already been forgotten."
There were continuing signs of a de-escalation of rhetoric
over the organizational resolution, which must be passed before
new Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively.
And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand that
the resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senate
considers presidential nominations. Senate Republican Conference
Chairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who last week hinted
Republicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did not
meet their concerns, today said, "I've said all along that I
don't want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantage
members." Democrats - despite their accommodating rhetoric - have
shown no signs of willingness to cede new authority to
Republicans on nominations. Daschle said Democrats would "respect
the process" currently in place.
Minority Whip Nickles said: "I think it's going to work . I
think it's going to be fine." Nickles said he expected a minimum
wage bill, accompanied by some tax relief, to pass this year. But
he said "it remains to be seen" whether a compromise can be
reached on a patients' rights bill, which Daschle has pledged to
bring up after completing work on the education bill. Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a key moderate, said it would be better
if Republicans and Democrats can come to some "mutual
understanding, rather than making some major changes, that may
not stand the test of time." The softening of the GOP stance came
as Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status.
The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen. Robert Byrd, D-
W.Va., as the new Senate president pro tempore.
The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet today
to discuss a new organizational resolution, and Daschle was
scheduled to meet with new committee chairmen. Until the Senate
passes a new resolution, freshmen must go without committee
assignments, and panels are composed of members from the 106th
Congress, many with GOP majorities. Daschle said Democrats would
make decisions about new panel assignments after the
organizational resolution is passed. - by Geoff Earle and Charlie
Mitchell

TAXES
House Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut Legislation
Frustrated that the change in Senate leadership has
overshadowed passage of the $1.35 trillion tax cut, House
Republicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief as
President Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday.
"Every paycheck, whether it be weekly, biweekly or monthly, will
be bigger in take home pay," House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas
said at a news conference today with GOP leaders. A spokesman for
House Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen. James Jeffords,
I-Vt., saturated media coverage just as the House and Senate
passed the tax cut bill. "Our view is we have to go out there and
communicate our message," the Hastert spokesman said, adding that
the new Democratic-controlled Senate does not override their
plans.
Thomas sought to correct what he said included "flat out
wrong" media explanations of the tax cut. Thomas said all
taxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer. He
emphasized that it was not a "one-time stunt," saying the tax cut
includes a permanent reduction in income tax rates. "It is an
ongoing gift to the American people, who are hard working,"
Thomas said. However, the tax bill, which passed under budget
rules, includes a provision that would "sunset" the tax cuts Dec.
31, 2010, unless they are made permanent. Thomas said the Senate
was responsible for the sunset provision, and sought to put the
onus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent. House
Majority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislation
to do that, commenting, "Why should we tell families and small
businesses the relief they need will disappear in 10 years?"
In a memo distributed today to House Republicans, Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, who is responsible
for GOP communications, said Jeffords' switch complicated his
party's ability to talk about tax relief. "Sen. Jeffords'
decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good news
and had two significant ripple effects - however temporary - for
House Republicans," he wrote. Watts said the Jeffords defection
gave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated the
media so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cut
bill.
Meanwhile, Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-
Iowa, said it was "possible" to take up a bill extending the
expiring tax breaks this year, while adding, "I think that's
probably wishful thinking, although I would welcome it." He said
he had met with Finance Chairman Baucus, and the two would
continue to work together on prescription drug legislation and
upcoming trade issues. He mentioned small business tax breaks and
energy provisions as other tax legislation that could still move
this year. He also said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., may be the
"leading candidate" to take the new seat on the Finance Committee
created by the party switch of Jeffords. But he noted Sens. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., are both more senior,
although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignments
to claim it. - by Mark Wegner

POLITICS
House GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key Issues
House Republican moderates said today their leadership has
made no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of the
defection of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., but complimented House
Speaker Hastert's leadership style and attentiveness to their
priorities. House GOP moderates hope to see movement on such
issues as patients' rights, a prescription drug benefit, campaign
finance reform and the environment. Moderates such as Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., described the Senate as a body of "100
independent operators" and said the Jeffords defection is less
relevant to House moderates, especially given Hastert's openness.
"We have access. He hears us out. We could not ask for a better
leader for the time," Boehlert said. He said the leadership might
not always heed moderates' wishes, but said he has seen progress
this year on some environmental issues, debt reduction and
education. Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay, often a
target of Democrats for his conservative positions, "has reached
out not only post-Jeffords, but pre-Jeffords."
Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., similarly said she has seen no
additional outreach from leadership, but called Jeffords'
decision a "red flag" for national party leaders. "In a two-party
system, you need to bring people together if we are to be in the
majority," she said. Roukema cited education reform as "good
evidence of excellent progress," but said she also would like to
see action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform.
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who urged Jeffords not to defect
and has been largely content with Hastert's treatment of campaign
finance reform, said moderate issues have found their way onto
the table this year. "That's why we don't have the problem in the
House," Shays said.
Speaking with reporters Tuesday, National Republican
Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used a
sports metaphor to describe Hastert's management of the GOP
Conference. Davis said that, unlike the Senate, House Republicans
may disagree in private but play "team ball" in public. "The key
to our success is we all play together," Davis said. Hardline
conservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficult
for members representing marginal districts. Rep. Michael Castle,
R-Del., said he hopes the new Democratic-controlled Senate might
provide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative in
his approach. "I'd assume our leaders think 'pure Republican'
positions need to be established in the House, but some of us in
the House would prefer that we pre-negotiate some things like
we've done on education," Castle said. "There will be some
pulling and tugging as we go along." - by Mark Wegner

ENERGY
House Drops Calif. Energy Bill, Daschle Wants Action
House Republicans pulled the plug on a short-term California
electricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal with
Democrats on a controversial price cap provision. The development
comes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make California
energy legislation a top priority of the Democrats' first month
in power. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman
will focus on producing a short-term bill in the next few weeks
before shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after the
July Fourth recess, he said today. "We'll see what we can agree
on in a short-term bill" by July 4, Bingaman said at a session
with reporters. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Daschle, clarifying
earlier remarks, said Congress should order the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to limit prices in California's wholesale
electricity market if FERC refuses to act.
In a letter to California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, Daschle
said that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices, "Congress will have
to consider legislation to address this issue." Although Daschle
said he does not believe Congress "can or should establish a
dollar amount for the price of electricity," he endorsed
legislation offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that orders FERC to limit prices. "Unless
FERC acts soon," Daschle said, the "legislation should be taken
up and passed . I will support all necessary efforts to meet that
goal." Daschle's comments come after Daschle appeared to soften
his support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview late
last week.
On the other side of the Capitol, House Democrats blasted
Republicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committee
markup of the California bill. "I think that the canceling of the
markup was a mistake," Energy and Commerce ranking member John
Dingell, D-Mich., said at a news conference. Earlier, Energy and
Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and Air
Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, told reporters
they pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel. The
Republican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill and
reject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices. But the
contentious votes would have made it more difficult to gather
Democratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan this
summer. Still, Tauzin said the planned committee action had
spurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers to
implement many of its provisions. Barton, the author of the bill,
said the victory was bittersweet. "I hope I don't have many more
victories like this," he grumbled. - by Brody Mullins

ENERGY
GOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against Attacks
Republican legislators on the House Resources Committee and
Interior Secretary Norton today made a pre-emptive strike against
critics of President Bush's national energy policy at a news
conference before Norton's testimony before the committee.
Resources Chairman Hansen, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin
and Norton defended the administration's energy policy, repeating
the mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections,
conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energy
measures as well as provisions to increase domestic oil
production. Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism against
increasing domestic oil production, arguing that the United
States must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent future
energy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries. But
Tauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administration
will concentrate their efforts "big time" on conservation, demand
reduction, environmental protections and alternative energy
sources.
Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designated
national monuments for drilling, Norton said the Interior
Department is studying the designated lands on a "case-by-case"
basis - receiving comments from state and local officials on
support for the national monuments, which were designated by the
Clinton administration during its final days. Norton noted that
some states steadfastly support their national monuments, while
others vehemently oppose the land restrictions, adding that the
department will take this into consideration before opening these
lands up for domestic oil production. Added Hansen, "What can be
opened up, should be."
At the other end of the hall, two Democratic panel members
held their own news conference to call attention to a designated
area in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July. A
coalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groups
joined Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Resources ranking member
Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., to introduce legislation to overturn a
federal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw, a
pristine Montana valley. The coalition argued the site contains
one of the most significant collections of Indian art on the
Northern Plans, including prehistoric, multicolored drawings of
shields, animals and human figures. Last month, a state agency
gave Denver-based Anschutz Exploration Corp. permission for
exploratory drilling in the valley. Anschutz holds leases to oil
rights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and has
permission to start drilling as early as July 21. During Norton's
testimony, Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop the
drilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibit
the drilling, but promised to continue to monitor the area and
work with local officials and tribal groups. - by Greta Wodele

FINANCE
LaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of Investors
House Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,
said today he intends to "aggressively" pursue an investigation
into the SEC's capacity to protect investors, saying that too
much of Congress' financial agenda traditionally has been
"industry driven." A case in point, LaFalce told a group of
reporters, is pending SEC fee reduction legislation, which he
said ought to have been considered in the context of "an
examination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be."
While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors,
LaFalce said he felt a "much larger look at issues and questions"
was warranted. While acknowledging the committee's work in the
area of financial modernization, he said, "This has been the
agenda of industry." Asserting that investor protections have
been ignored for the last 25 years, LaFalce said one issue where
there is "a crying need for a thorough, exhaustive investigation
[is] the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given [the
agency's] limited resources and reach of the law. I intend to
pursue this aggressively." In that vein, LaFalce expressed a
desire to see the SEC's enforcement capabilities beefed up by
increasing the agency's enforcement staff "not by 2 or 3 percent,
but by 200 to 300 percent."
With the Senate's shift from Republican to Democratic control,
LaFalce contended that the "stumbling block" to consumer advocacy
in that chamber "has been eradicated. Proponents of consumer
advocacy have been emboldened." Noting that newly installed
Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protection
concerns, LaFalce said he expected he would be helped both
offensively and defensively in the House. "It will help me both
advance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose," LaFalce said.
Overall, LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leverage
in the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda. "If
you know an issue is going to be taken up in conference, you
might as well take it up now," LaFalce said.
As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley, who has been
criticized in some circles as relying too heavily on the
financial industry in setting his agenda and priorities, LaFalce
described their working relationship as still evolving. While
expressing great affection for Oxley personally, as a friend of
20 years, LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxley's "substantive
disposition" on a number of fronts - consumer protection
included. He intimated there might be too much top down control,
with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen on
what and when to hold hearings and markups. "I don't think that's
the way to legislate, LaFalce said. "That is not my idea of
thoughtful legislating." - by Pamela Barnett

HEALTH
Managed Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation Factor
Leaders of the managed care industry today sketched out for
reporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the next
several weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients' rights
bill - that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patients
more than it would help them. "It would be impossible not to
conclude . that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcare
system," Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of the American
Association of Health Plans, said at a briefing. Ignagni said
that by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans in
both state and federal courts, the bill sponsored by Senate
Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards,
D-N.C., and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman
Kennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of health
insurance. "And the only way for [employers] to recoup is for
workers to trade additional wages, or workers will have to pay
more directly for health care," Ignagni said.
While the AAHP has expressed "concerns" with the leading
alternative measure - sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt., and backed by
President Bush - Ignagni was careful not to rule out the
possibility that the organization could ultimately back some
expansion of liability in federal court only. While the
organization has been steadfast over the past five years in its
opposition to any expansion of liability while supporting a
requirement for independent outside review of health plan
denials, Ignagni said a decision to support the Frist-Breaux-
Jeffords bill or any other substitute "will be made by our
members," who "will be instructing us every step of the way."
Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and business
opponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry, which
has been largely supportive of patients' rights legislation,
particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay for
emergency room care. Further study of liability language has
shown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits,
Ignagni said, but also hospitals. "Every hospital in this country
is as vulnerable as every physician," she said. - by Julie Rovner

TRADE
Legislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat Board
Senate Finance Chairman Baucus, Budget Chairman Conrad, Sens.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, and Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., today urged the
International Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue an
aggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board, a state
trading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat.
Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested the
investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act last
October, and the ITC has said it will submit a confidential
report to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative by Sept.
24. Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained that
since the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect in
1989 the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretive
trading practices to sell wheat in the United States and in
markets where U.S. and Canadian producers compete.
"What we need from the commission in this investigation is an
exhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricing
policies of the wheat board and the most precise possible
quantification of the effects on U.S. producers of these unfair
practices," Baucus said. "And we need that information to be made
available to interested parties and the public to the maximum
extent possible." Charging that the Canadian government and the
wheat board have "stonewalled" previous U.S. efforts to get
information on the wheat board's operations, Baucus urged the ITC
to "use all secondary sources in the U.S. government and the U.S.
and Canadian private sectors" to collect information and draw
"meaningful conclusions."
Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to a
petition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission, the
investigation has the support of national and other state wheat
groups as well. Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support for
future trade agreements has eroded in the northern border states
because residents there believe the agreement with Canada has
worked to their disadvantage. Pomeroy also said that, if the
Canadians refuse to provide information, "silence can and must be
used against them." Dorgan said U.S. farmers had been "patient"
with the government for 10 years and that the U.S. response to
the Canadian situation to date has been "pathetic." An ITC
official noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Board
was invited to testify, but chose not to. - by Jerry Hagstrom

FINANCE
Grassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On Bankruptcy
Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, today
said he intends to meet as early as this week with House
Republican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge a
consensus strategy on "the difficult parliamentary situation"
brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation. The House and Senate
each have passed individual bills but Republicans want to avoid
reopening the measure in conference. The House has the option of
taking up the Senate-passed bill, but Grassley indicated that is
unlikely, noting the Senate bill's inclusion of language
pertaining to homestead exemptions and clinic violence.

ENERGY
Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheney's Energy Task Force
House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote
Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice
President Cheney's energy task force, which met privately with
major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administration's
energy policy, the Associated Press reported. Government Reform
ranking member Henry Waxman, D-Calif., asked Burton to conduct a
hearing on what took place at the Cheney group's secret meetings
and the identities of all participants. "The Cheney task force
has conducted its meetings in private, and reportedly has
obtained input from private citizens and groups, including
political contributors," Waxman wrote in the letter. The AP
reported last month that GOP contributors - including executives
from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute,
the utility industry lobbying group - had met with Cheney to
discuss energy policy. A committee spokesman said the Republican
staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton.

POLITICS
Evans Participates In Steel Industry Rally
Commerce Secretary Evans joined members of Congress from both
parties today in pledging to stand with the United Steelworkers
of America in their effort to help the ailing domestic steel
industry. Evans' presence at rally at the Capitol came one day
after the administration announced it was starting a Section 201
action in response to evidence of serious injury the industry has
suffered as a result of allegedly illegal dumping by foreign
producers. Evans said the move was just a first step in
addressing what has become an uneven playing field. Just how far
the administration would go beyond taking action under existing
trade laws is not clear. While the workers and their allies in
Congress greeted the news of the Section 201 action positively,
they pressed today for passage of a bill that would also provide
government subsidies to help ailing steel manufacturers rebuild
and recover and shore up health and retirement funds hit hard by
the crisis in the last few years.

POLITICS
Watson Wins Special Election
Democratic state Sen. Diane Watson coasted to an easy victory
Tuesday in the special election to pick a successor to the late
Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif. With all precincts reporting, Watson
- a former ambassador and the first black woman elected to the
California state Senate - had 75 percent of the vote, while
Republican nominee Noel Irwin Hentschel had 20 percent. Watson's
victory means the House Republicans now hold a 221-210 majority,
with two independents and two vacancies. The next special
election will be held June 19 to fill the vacancy created by the
death of Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., while a special election has
yet to be set to choose a successor to the late Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., who died on Memorial Day. Watson will be sworn into her
new office Thursday. Watson's election was virtually assured once
she won the Democratic nomination, since the 32nd District is 73
percent Democratic. Its population is 40 percent black, with a
growing number of Hispanics.

Aleck & Richard:

Just a quick update following my meetings yesterday in the Premier's Office.

Without question, the majority of decision-makers were leaning strongly
towards announcing a firm Spring 2002 opening date.

It has been conveyed to me that our (Enron/GPC) efforts prior to the
announcement by the Minister made a significant impact on the softening of
the announcement, making May 2002 a deadline and leaving the possibility for
a November opening.  While other stakeholders were advocating a November
opening (also largely thanks to the Enron/GPC effort, e.g. Board of Trade),
their arguments did not provide the same technical persuasiveness (with
concerns such as those regarding supply) as the Enron effort.  This
expertise coupled with sensitivity towards the political needs and pressures
resulted in an argument that surpassed those being made by some of the
industrials.

Recent comments by the Minister and others also suggest that the
government's message may change to "working towards November".  The
Lay/Harris meeting, our ongoing efforts to mitigate the influence of market
opening opponents, and our efforts to persuade decision-makers that the four
conditions have been met should help us meet our objectives.

Best regards,

Cheney's Role Offers Strengths And Liabilities 
By Mike Allen and Dana Milbank
Washington Post Staff Writers
Thursday, May 17, 2001; Page A01 
The key to the energy proposal President Bush unveils today can be found on a 
wall in the three-room suite that houses his National Energy Policy 
Development Group, next door to the White House in the Eisenhower Executive 
Office Building.
On the wall hangs a huge erasable board that serves as a giant checklist to 
guide the preparation of the administration's eight-chapter energy policy, 
which Bush formally unveils in Minnesota today. For each chapter, there's a 
check mark for two rough drafts, a peer review, a final draft, two more 
rounds of recommendations on the drafts, then graphics and photos. Toward the 
end of the checklist is an all-important box to check: "Concurrence of the 
OVP."
The OVP -- Office of the Vice President -- has driven every aspect of the 
energy report. No proposed recommendation has survived without the consent of 
one man: Vice President Cheney, the administration's indispensable man -- and 
chair of the energy task force.
The release of the energy report shines a new spotlight on Cheney, a quiet 
conservative from Wyoming who has been given credit for running the show 
without annoying or upstaging his boss. The handling of the energy task force 
so far reflects Cheney's personality near perfectly: It is a closely held 
process with a high regard for the concerns of industry. This close 
involvement of Cheney is partially a strength, because the effort has been 
efficient and well-managed.
But Cheney's strong role is also potentially the report's weakness. He is 
about to undergo a blast of unwanted scrutiny as critics seize on his 
finances and oil industry ties in an effort to discredit the policy.
Democrats and environmental groups are charging that his judgment on energy 
matters is suspect because of his chairmanship until August of Halliburton 
Co., a Dallas-based energy services firm that is expected to benefit from 
several parts of President Bush's policy. Cheney, 60, made $36 million last 
year, most it in compensation from Halliburton, including salary and his 
exercise of stock options and sale of restricted stock.
"He is seeing the problem entirely from the side of the energy producing 
industry that made him a millionaire, not from a consumer struggling to make 
ends meet," said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental 
Trust.
An official close to Cheney called such suggestions "an outrage," and said 
his expertise in the industry and knowledge of its technology were crucial to 
"trying to solve a problem of this magnitude."
Although the plan has extensive recommendations about using technology to 
conserve energy and produce power more cleanly, the heart of the report is 
its conclusion that the United States needs hundreds more power plants, 
natural gas pipelines, oil wells and nuclear reactors.
Several administration officials acknowledged that Cheney had handed 
ammunition to his critics by declaring in a speech in Toronto on April 30 
that conservation "may be a sign of personal virtue," but is not a sound 
basis for a comprehensive energy policy.
"Given his background, he should've been real careful," said Sen. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has offered an alternative energy plan that he says 
focuses equally on supply and demand. "I think they've had some real 
stumbles."
Sen. Craig Thomas (R), who succeeded Cheney as Wyoming's lone House member in 
1989, said he does not expect such criticism to rattle the circumspect 
Cheney. "He'll just say, 'All right. That's the way it is, folks. I'm doing 
my job. Here's my plan,' " Thomas said.
As always when questions are asked about Cheney's influence, White House 
officials argue vigorously that the energy plan is Bush's plan. An official 
close to Bush said Cheney and other task force members had updated the 
president often since beginning their work on Jan. 29. "At several critical 
decision points, the group has come to the president to ask him to make 
judgments and decisions," the official said.
Cheney's directions are carried out by the task force's executive director, 
Andrew Lundquist, his deputy, Karen Knudsen, and four other staff members. 
Cheney also chairs the task force itself, which includes the secretaries of 
energy, interior, treasury, agriculture, commerce and transportation and the 
head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Aides say Cheney met with only half a dozen of the interest groups seeking 
input into the policy, including Enron Corp., the Houston energy conglomerate 
that is a large and longtime Bush contributor, and the Edison Electric 
Institute, an energy trade group. Vance Meyer, a spokesman for Enron, said 
the firm's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and another executive had a 30-minute 
meeting with Cheney. Edison assembled 15 or 20 chief executives to meet with 
Cheney.
But Lundquist and Knudsen, representing Cheney, met with half of the 400 or 
so groups -- industry, environmental, regulatory and academic -- that 
requested access. Exactly which groups the Cheney advisers met with is being 
kept secret by the White House.
The task force's stealthy operation reflects Cheney's distaste for publicity. 
Following news reports about the private nature of the energy deliberations, 
Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Government Reform 
Committee requested information about the groups the task force met with. 
Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington, rebuffed the members of Congress, 
arguing that there was no legal requirement to comply with the request.
In a seven-page response to the request, Lundquist wrote that the meetings 
"were simply forums to collect individual views rather than to bring a 
collective judgment to bear." White House officials have declined to disclose 
the list of meetings or attendees. Aides said representatives at the meetings 
included 118 energy industry or corporate groups, 40 renewable energy 
providers, 22 unions, 13 environmental groups, five academics, 63 
governmental groups, six energy efficiency proponents and a consumer group.
Environmentalists complain that the meetings reflected Cheney's 
predispositions. The vice president met with industry leaders, while 
dispatching aides to speak to environmentalists, several of which were 
grouped into one meeting. The meetings of 22 labor representatives, who 
gathered in groups, were publicized by the White House, but sessions with 
industry were not.
Cheney, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the Associated 
Press that he hasn't consulted with any officials from Halliburton and 
rejected the notion that the task force's work is compromised by his private 
meetings with industry officials who give money to the Republican Party. 
"Just because somebody makes a campaign contribution doesn't mean that they 
should be denied the opportunity to express their views to government 
officials," he said.
Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinet-level task force, mostly in his 
ceremonial office. Each of the meetings, attended by the task force members 
and aides, lasted 90 minutes, with Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and 
Bush economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey often reflecting different 
interests.
For 20 minutes at the end of each session, Cheney told staffers to leave the 
room so the top officials could settle differences privately, without risk of 
the differences being leaked to the news media. In only a few cases did Bush 
have to resolve disputes among advisers, participants said. In most cases, 
Cheney was able discreetly to broker agreement among the Cabinet members.

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told 
reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the 
parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals.
California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
"billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

Some originators today reiterated how valuable Gov't Affairs can be in 
bringing deals (citing Tom Chapman -- Alamac and Dan Allegretti -UI).  The 
new East power services desk (headed by Lloyd Will and Tom May) is taking off 
and very interested in muni, industrial on-site generation purchases, 
scheduling, etc.  Origination (EPMI and EES) are interested in structured 
deals -- all requirements, tolling, etc.  Thanks for keeping this in mind 
while out there in the trenches!

As you are aware a provincial general election was held yesterday in 
Alberta.   When the election was called the governing Progressive 
Conservative Party led by Ralph Klein held a strong majority of 63 of the 83 
seats in our Provincial Legislature.   The Liberals had 18 seats and the New 
Democrats (socialist) had 2 seats.

The two issues that dominated the election campaign were: #1 health care, and 
#2 electricity restructuring.   The PC's faced considerable criticism 
regarding their handling of restructuring.   The Liberals came out with a 
policy platform on electricity restructuring that envisioned the government 
taking back the PPAs "by negotiation or legislation, if necessary" at a price 
below market and using this supply to provide cost-based power to residential 
and commercial customers.  Only customers with load greater than 5 MW would 
be exposed to market prices.  The ND's policy platform was to scrap 
electricity deregulation entirely.  

Throughout the campaign the PC's defended their electricity restructuring 
policy and pledged to continue to protect Alberta consumers from the effects 
of rising natural gas and electricity prices.  To date, this protection has 
taken the form of natural gas and electricity rebate payments funded from the 
sale of the PPA's and from the provincial treasury.

I'm pleased to report the PC's enjoyed a landslide victory last night that 
appeared to even surprise them.  They increased their number of seats to 74 
of the 83 seats in our Legislature while the Liberals were reduced to 7 seats 
and the ND's retained the 2 seats they had.   With this new and significant 5 
year mandate, I am optimistic the PC Government will now be less focused on 
depressing short-term wholesale power prices and will be more prepared to 
focus on longer-term policy decisions and initiatives that will: i) attract 
new generation, iii) attract new retailers, and iii) give electricity 
restructuring a chance to actually deliver on the benefits it promised.    

We are well positioned to influence the Alberta Government going forward and 
I will be requesting further internal and external resources to help me 
develop and communicate our market design proposals further.   If Enron can 
help Alberta overcome the serious supply and retail market problems it 
presently faces, I can see a day when Alberta is held out as an electricity 
restructuring success story.     

Regards,

Rob

With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and "combines" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the "right 
example").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to "junk" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the "market 
front-end" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

The House Ways and Means Committee will consider the tax portions of the 
"energy" bill after the July 4 recess.  We have learned that the Democrats on 
the Committee may offer a windfall profits tax on energy to pay for other 
aspects of the tax bill.  The price of the tax bill has grown from the 
Administration's anticipated level of $10 billion to over $50 billion and 
under the pay-go rules additional tax cuts must be paid for from other 
sources.  A similar amendment by Senator Rockefeller (D-WV) was overwhelming 
rejected by the Senate Finance Committee.  We do not want to take anything 
for granted as this could be continuously raised during the energy debate.

Per my request, Mike Pate is going to hold a meeting next week with EPSA, 
API, EEI and other related associations to decide how to combat this and 
future efforts on the windfall profits tax.  He will also invite company 
representatives from El Paso, Duke, Williams and others.  However, we think 
this effort is best pursued by our associations to avoid unwanted attention 
to earnings.

I will update as this develops.

Below is the exact wording of the recommendations in the Cheney energy report 
released today as the recommendations relate to electricity issues.

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of Energy 
to propose comprehensive electricity legislation that promotes competition, 
protects consumers, enhances reliability, promotes renewable energy, improves 
efficiency, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and reforms the 
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President encourage FERC to use its 
existing statutory authority to promote competition and encourage investment 
in transmission facilities."

More details to follow.  We expect to have the full report document shortly.

Attached please find the long awaited, much anticipated Garden State 
Paper/Public Service Electric & Gas amendment which will do the following for 
GSP:
1)  Secure TETCO M3 receipt through 10/31/2007
2)  Secure the current discounted LDC transportation rate through 10/31/07
I have reviewed the document and it seems in good order.  This agreement does 
hedge GSP against increases in the base transportation rate on the LDC and 
insures that GSP will have TETCO M3 (as opposed to the currently higher 
Transco Z6 NY) as its receipt point, but it does NOT hedge GSP's M3 basis 
exposure.  That exposure can be hedged through ENA or other wholesale gas 
trading companies.  

Please review it and execute two (2) copies soon as possible.  Thereafter, 
please mail them to the attention of:
Mr. David W. Wohlfarth
Public Service Electric and Gas Company
80 Park Plaza
Newark, New Jersey  07101
(phone) 973-430-5674

Credit for securing this amendment should go to Steve Montovano, VP Gov/Reg 
Affairs.  He was very instrumental in getting PSEG to give GSP this amendment.

If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

We have some additional information on this as well that we just got wind of 
this afternoon.  The Interlata relief bill that will be introduced on Monday 
or Tuesday by Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell will be nearly identical to last 
year's bill, H.R. 2420.  Tauzin will hold a full committee hearing on the 
bill next Wednesday with invited witnesses to include Verizon, Covad, Highway 
One (a DSL carrier in NY) and McLeod.  We aren't aware of any administration 
types being invited, i.e. Powell or someone from NTIA.  A subcommittee markup 
will likely be scheduled for the following week, with the full committee 
mark-up to occur sometime before Memorial Day, depending on what is happening 
in the Committee with regards to the California situation.

On the Senate side, we are hearing that Senator Sam Brownback will 
reintroduce his RBOC legislation from last year which is more of a RBOC 
friendly bill than Tauzin's in that RBOCs would no longer be subject to 
Federal requirements concerning facilities and equipment carriage of advanced 
communications services.  We understand that Brownback intends to introduce 
his legislation sometime before Memorial Day but that he is actively seeking 
a Democratic co-sponsor, something that he was not able to do last Congress 
either.  Opponents of the bill are working the Senate side to ensure he does 
not find an ally.  We understand that Tauzin has kept in close contact with 
his fellow Louisianan Senator John Breaux on the goings-on in the House and 
that Breaux may be willing to help move things along in the Senate, however 
as Scott stated previously, Senator McCain, as we know, is likely not to take 
an active position on the legislation.  Senators Hollings (Ranking Member of 
the Commerce Committee), Senator Stevens and Senator Lott are all said to be 
against moving forward with any form of 271 relief.  Despite all of the 
Senate activity, the bottom line is that Scott's assessment is accurate - we 
don't see anything moving out of the Senate this year.

		 Subject: RBOC Sec. 271 Legislative Update

Federal Sec. 271 Relief Legislation:  Rep. Billy Tauzin, Chairman of the 
House Commerce Committee, is expected to introduce legislation on 4/23 to 
enable ILECs to provide interLATA data services without opening their local 
networks to competitors.  The bill would allow the Bells to transmit data 
across local market boundaries and also allow the RBOCs to deploy 
high-capacity facilities without having to lease or resell them as UNEs. Rep. 
John Dingell, the Commerce Committee ranking member will be a co-sponser.

This bill last Congress had over 200 co-sponsors and made it to committee 
mark-up, but was stifled by then-Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley and supporters 
of AT&T.  This year, Tauzin is expected to push it through his committee 
vigorously and it may come to the House floor for a vote.  However, the 
Senate seems unlikely to take this up in a serious way this year due to Sen. 
McCain's reluctance to follow Rep. Tauzin's agenda and Sen. Hollings' solid 
support of AT&T.  We expect this legislation to create a lot of noise this 
year, but not move through the Senate until next year if at all.

Rick:

This is quick note to let you know that I shall work very closely with Lisa 
on Fireball project (see first project below).  While working in her group to 
provide the required regulatory due diligence, we shall also attempt to:  a) 
link the effort to RAC process (mainly through Dave Gorte), b) Find accurate 
measure to reflect the risk the Enron sees for GA reporting purposes (also 
measures for our contribution to the project).

Not only this project is important in terms of size ($750 million), but also 
in its activity (acquisition of coal company); it is an excellent opportunity 
to document the processes followed as they happen.    

I am grateful for Lisa's help and support.

Please let me know if you have any question.

CONFIDENTIAL

On Friday the Office of the Rail Regulator initiated a further investigation 
stemming from our complaint about abuse of dominance by EWS Railways.  In 
addition our allegations of discrimination and refusing to deal, ORR are now 
also investigating EWS's locomotives contract with General Motors (under 
which we believe EWS receives a payment when GM sells locos to third-party 
rail freight operators).

ORR had been discussing jurisdiction with the Department of Justice in the US 
and with the EC, however, both have now declined jurisdiction. ORR is 
therefore taking the investigation forward via a request for information from 
EWS.  This is one of the clearest abuses outlined in our complaint and it is 
therefore very encouraging to see ORR take the matter forward.  Further 
details are set out in the attached fax below.

fyi... editorial in today's LA Daily News:


Lockyer lockdown 


Not wanting to be outdone by Gov. Gray Davis, California Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer recently tried his hand at Sacramento's new favorite game: 
demonizing power generators. 
Elaborating on his plan to file criminal charges against energy officials, 
Lockyer singled out Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay for imprudent remarks. 
"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell," Lockyer told The 
Wall Street Journal, "that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi 
my name is Spike, honey."' 
Get it? 
Spike would proceed to rape, maul and otherwise abuse Lay. 
Real funny, isn't it? 
Rape is widely considered commonplace in prison, and for good reason. Human 
Rights Watch estimates that as many 140,000 inmates have been raped in 
penitentiaries nationwide. 
In a recent study, the organization documented instances of sexual slavery 
taking place in prisons in six different states -- including California. 
That should be a serious concern for the state's top law-enforcement official 
-- not a laughing matter. 
Lockyer might have only been kidding, but his joke contains a tacit admission 
that rape is rampant in the state prison system. It suggests that he thinks 
this illegal and unconstitutional horror might, on occasion, serve as just 
punishment for some. 
Perhaps that's why prison officials -- in California and elsewhere -- have 
done so little to contain the problem. 
But their neglect comes at society's expense. Sexual abuse in American 
prisons hardens prisoners and makes them more dangerous upon their release. 
Rather than rehabilitating criminals, dangerous prisons reinforce their sense 
of lawlessness. 
We're willing to write off Lockyer's statement as merely thoughtless and 
unfunny, but we doubt that others will be quick to let him off so lightly. 
It's hard to imagine that a lawyer representing a raped inmate -- or the 
entire class of raped inmates -- would be quite so forgiving. 
In a lawsuit against the state corrections system, a quote from the attorney 
general making light of rampant sexual violence in state prisons could be 
damning. 
As the state's top attorney, Lockyer should know better than to serve up 
political rhetoric that could open up his clients -- the taxpayers -- to 
millions of dollars in legal penalties. 
His reckless words and callous attitude do little to inspire public 
confidence.

Several entities, including Bangor Hydro, Central Maine and National Grid, 
filed with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit an emergency request of 
FERC's order on NEPOOL ICAP.  As you may recall, the Commission issued an 
order on rehearing last month finding that the ICAP charge should have been 
17 cents from August 2000 (approximately) until April 1, 2001.  On April 1, 
2001, FERC approved the new ICAP charge of $8.75 until the ISO proposes a 
different charge.

On Friday, the First Circuit granted the emergency request for stay.  In 
response to the court's ruling, FERC issued an order Friday evening stating 
that the 17 cent charge will remain in effect until the court rules further.  

We are trying to obtain a copy of the court's ruling now and we have alerted 
the traders about the change.  Please let me know if you have any questions 
about this ruling.  We'll keep you posted.

Rick and Steve -

Attached is Enron's government affairs strategy with respect to the potential 
threat of "201" restrictions on steel imports.   This was developed with the 
input of the DC office and outside counsel.  We will be meeting with Eric 
Thode later this week to discuss the public relations piece.  

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like background 
information on section 201.

Lisa

The Southeast RTO:=20
The "Backstory" Behind the Press Release=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]Owners of transmission systems across Alabama, Florida, Georgia,=20
Mississippi, and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum =
of=20
understanding (MOU) to develop a regional transmission organization (RTO) f=
or=20
the Southeast. A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end =
of=20
this article. Two of the largest members of this new organization are=20
Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and Santee Cooper. If the transmission owners=
=20
prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity, the=
=20
RTO would be one of the nation's largest, covering more than 39,000 miles o=
f=20
transmission with an investment in assets in excess of $6 billion.=20

Analysis: The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is=
=20
not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern=
=20
Company. However, the development of this much-anticipated RTO illustrates=
=20
how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating, answers=
=20
questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives, a=
nd=20
raises speculation about possible impact on the region's already-establishe=
d=20
RTO, GridSouth. Further, as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the=20
country, much of the commission's focus has been placed on the Southeastern=
=20
United States (along with the West). The Southeast is dominated by large IO=
Us=20
that control massive transmission assets. Thus, seeing that Southeastern=20
transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for=
=20
FERC.=20

You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo=
rm=20
its own RTO (the organization that will manage a transmission network withi=
n=20
a particular region). FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because=20
Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth=
er=20
than the RTO operator, which violated FERC policy. In addition, it is FERC'=
s=20
general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country, and the=20
commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous =
if=20
it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity. Thus, FERC=20
unequivocally told Southern Company to not re-apply for RTO status until it=
=20
had explored joining forces with neighboring companies.=20

Simultaneously, FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth, an RTO formed =
by=20
Carolina Power & Light, Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric & Gas=20
(SCANA), Southern Company's neighbors to the north. The conditional approva=
l=20
came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the=
=20
SeTrans Gridco, Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) about=20
joining GridSouth. Again, FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to=
=20
see a single, large RTO serving the entire Southeast region.=20

Nevertheless, now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit=
h=20
seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate=
=20
entity from GridSouth. I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what=
=20
impact (if any) the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on=20
GridSouth. However, as of press time, representatives for GridSouth had not=
=20
prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity. =20

I spoke with John Sell, a Southern Company spokesperson on June 19. Sell=20
informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with=
=20
GridSouth upon FERC's directive, but determined that GridSouth was "too far=
=20
down the road" in terms of its development, and that Southern Company plann=
ed=20
on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets. For instance=
,=20
while both entities are for-profit operations, the new Southeast RTO plans =
to=20
hire an independent third party to oversee its operations. Further, althoug=
h=20
the term "Southeast RTO" is being used in the press release, Sell told me=
=20
that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as=
=20
SeTrans (the name of Southern Company's rejected entity). Sell stressed tha=
t=20
the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established=
=20
by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern=
=20
has majority power over the RTO. In fact, the name will be changed to=20
something else later this year.=20

On a related note, one statement that I found particularly interesting in t=
he=20
press release about the new RTO is that "the companies have also made it=20
clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi=
on=20
owner, but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which=
=20
they will operate and make decisions." This is clearly a veiled reference t=
o=20
Southern Company, which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in=
=20
its original RTO filing. When I spoke with John Sell, he volunteered that=
=20
Southern "is not the driver behind this RTO."=20

Santee Cooper's involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha=
t=20
precarious fashion. As noted, FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w=
ay=20
to incorporate Santee Cooper, a state-owned utility located in South=20
Carolina, into its RTO. As Santee Cooper controls about 4,200 miles of=20
transmission lines covering 75 percent of South Carolina, it is no wonder=
=20
that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was=20
conjoined in some way to developing RTOs. There was just one problem with=
=20
this plan: the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from=20
joining for-profit enterprises. =20

The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi=
c=20
power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations=
=20
to join RTOs. New reports indicate that, if the SeTrans RTO is approved by=
=20
FERC, it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power=
=20
entity. However, it is important to note that Desert Star, an RTO based in=
=20
Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states, includes=
=20
the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), which owns about one-third of=
=20
the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to 28 of 29=
=20
of the state's municipal electric systems. =20

Naturally, as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a for-profit entity, th=
e=20
question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a=
=20
member given the South Carolina law. I spoke with Stephen Pelcher, associat=
e=20
general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper, about this=20
conundrum. There is an important distinction that should be understood.=20
GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents (Caroli=
na=20
Power & Light, Duke and SCANA). The obstacle facing Santee Cooper's=20
participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder =
in=20
a private corporation. Under the SeTrans RTO, in which Santee Cooper is now=
 a=20
participant, none of the participating companies will have ownership over t=
he=20
transmission entity. As noted, this was one of Southern Company's main=20
interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an=20
independent third party to oversee its operations. Pelcher told me that the=
=20
SeTrans RTO is still in a "preliminary stage" and thus it appears at this=
=20
time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their=20
transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe=
nt=20
third party. Interestingly, Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper (and, b=
y=20
extension, the SeTrans RTO) remains in consultation with GridSouth for a=20
"coordination and implementation service agreement" that would in some way=
=20
interconnect the two entities.=20

One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how=
=20
electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems.=20
Specifically, FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o=
ne=20
RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO=
s=20
could become "speed bumps" in the flow of electricity. In fact, the=20
commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy=20
related to these "seam issues." Part of the reason that Southern Company's=
=20
original, independent RTO plan was rejected was FERC's concern that the=20
utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive, interconnected system in=
=20
the region. At this point, it appears that FERC favors standardization in h=
ow=20
adjacent RTOs will relate to each other, and thus has instructed developing=
=20
RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements. FERC reportedly is=20
planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this=20
year. Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether =
or=20
not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among=20
developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist.=
=20

Thus, as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow, it will need to determine how i=
t=20
will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida (and any other adjacent RTOs=
).=20
In addition, Southern Company's John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans=
=20
RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement. At this point, TVA has=
=20
made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and =
in=20
fact, as a federal agency, is under no obligation to join an RTO.=20

The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for=
=20
the commission's deadline of being formed by Dec. 15 of this year. If the=
=20
SeTrans RTO (or whatever it is ultimately called) gains FERC's approval, it=
=20
will represent a significant part of the Southeast's development into a=20
functionally competitive electric market. If FERC's stated policy of=20
consolidating RTOs is effectively applied, ultimately we could see that=20
GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO, which now includes Southern=20
Company, Santee Cooper and (through a seam agreement) TVA. Moreover, the=20
development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of=20
conjoining companies that transcend federal, state and municipal levels,=20
along with the challenges of ensuring that adjacent RTOs form synergistic=
=20
policies regarding the flow of power.=20

Please see the summary below.  Of note is Chairman Scriber's comment that he 
is going to raise the shopping credit for the southern utilities - I think 
this increases are leverage going in to meetings with AEP.  I would also 
recommend that we move on Cinergy and strike while the iron is hot.  On the 
other hand, if we hold off, we could get higher shopping credits.  However, 
the utilities will argue to recover the amount of the increase through the 
Regulatory Asset Charge.  Although the stipulations in the cases, to the best 
of my recollection, do not provide for this, my sense is that they would 
recover the cost.  

Schriber's comments on POLR are also interesting in light of the statute that 
requires competitive bidding at the end of the Market Development Period.  I 
think this summer would be a good time to meet with Schriber to discuss our 
views on the POLR issue and would welcome feedback from any of you as to what 
we want to say.  My inclination for starters is to require separate bids by 
utility by customer class so that we do not have to mix residential with 
commercial.  Also I would argue that that the winning bidder automatically 
become the POLR and that the utility not be in a position to usurp this role 
by matching the winning bidder's price.  Other thoughts on how the POLR rate 
should be structured, i.e. is it based on a market index plus or a fixed 
price, need to be discussed in terms of how you compare bids.

Also please note the comments on transmission.

		 Subject: Schriber 5/23 testiimony

Chairman Schriber testified to the House Public Utilities Committee on May 
23.  After a very brief overview of his history with SB 3, he focused on the 
fact "not much progress had been made" in the southern half of Ohio, where 
customer switching rates were low.  He stated that inducing shopping will be 
a major effort of the Commission this coming year (although he acknowledged 
that the effort was like"pushing on a string"), and he expressly stated that 
the Commission will order higher shopping credits next year.  Several staff 
members I spoke to in the afternoon were surprised he had spoken definitively 
on that issue.  He also highlighted the MSG controversy before the 
Commission, stating that it was a "no win situation for the PUCO".  

Predictably, he commented on the differences between California and Ohio, 
pointing out there had been no divestiture in Ohio, contrasting bilateral 
contracts with the Cal PX, noting that California limited purchasing to the 
day ahead and spot markets, and claiming that our transmission system was 
more robust.  Despite these assurances, he expressed a concern over the 
potential situation at the end of the transition period(s), when wholesale 
prices could still be higher than the current capped rate.  The PUCO, he 
claimed, is thinking hard over who will be the provider of last resort, and 
at what price; and stated that there will be a need for the POLR to manage 
their risk by entering into long term arrangements for procuring power.  

Schriber stated that the potential for problems when the market development 
period ends may be mitigated by the size of the market and the state of the 
transmission system, and asserted the need to push FERC on these issues.  He 
expressed comfort about the new generating capacity coming on line in Ohio -- 
2200 MW having been added since 1999.   At the same time he was cautious 
about the fact that this was gas fired generation.

On the subject of natural gas, Schriber noted that forward prices for gas had 
fallen to the $4.50/$5.00 for next winter.  He stated that the PUO is 
contemplating a limited pilot program for next year that would provide 
opportunities for utilities to hedge their purchases.

Several legislators asked questions at the end of the presentation.  The 
concerns reflected were:

1. Commission management of the POLR's market price after the end of the 
market development.  Alan had no specific answer, other than the fact the 
PUCO was thinking about this issue.

2. Federal plan to utilize eminent domain to bolster the electric 
transmission system.  Alan responded by noting Ohio's strong transmission 
siting authority, which he believed was preferable to federal exercise of 
authority.  On the other hand he noted that some states like Indiana don't 
have a strong state siting law, and in those cases federal exercise of 
jurisdiction may be necessary.  He said that if the federal government 
exercises authority in the manner that Ohio does, that would be appropriate.

3.  Representative Sites was concerned about the sapping of "our" power 
supplies by other states, and asked what we could do to prevent it.  Alan 
responded that we cannot embargo "our" generating facilities.

4.  Representative Driehaus asked whether the reluctance of CG&E customers to 
switch was a result of what happened in the gas market in Cincinnati.  
Schriber responded by saying that, unlike the gas situation, competitive 
electricity providers were required to be certified by the PUCO.

Paul - thanks for forwarding.

Rick
I don't know if this is material for Steve's meeting, but may be of interest 
to you anyway.
Given our increasing confidence that the Arcos capacity isssue is settled, 
John Sheriff & Michael Brown indicated that they may consider another 
regulatory battle in Europe, possibly on gas, and have asked Paul Hennemeyer 
& me to draw up a list of possible complaints.  As you know, Germany is 
probably our biggest problem area, but that may not mean this is the battle 
we want to fight first.
Significantly, the European Commission is losing patience with Germany.  I 
attended the European Gas Regulatory Forum in Madrid this week (consists of 
delegates from member states gas regulators, ministries, the Commission and 
groups representing Gas Transmission Enterprises, consumer groups, offshore 
gas producers, incumbent suppliers, European Federation of Energy Traders.  
The representative from the German ministry was unbelievably outspoken about 
refusing to agree that consensus had been reached on anything, and supported 
GTE's refusal to publish any information on available capacity, transparent 
terms of access.  They also refused to recognise that the Council of European 
Energy Regulators might have any authority over Germany as they had chosen to 
go down a different route.  Political patience is clearly running out and the 
Commission is considering how they might use powers under Article 86 to 
progress either the proposed acceleratino directive or a new directive on 
information disclosure, in spite of Germany.  (Brendan says they have already 
used these powers in telecomms).

As per Sergio's and Rick's request, please find enclosed a quick summary on 
the ANEEL's  "intervention" in the MAE.

This note is organized in four main sections:

a) What was it?
b) Initial reactions
c) Enron's view
d) Next steps


a) WHAT WAS IT?

 Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions (160/161/162) 
significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE. It has also 
amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial 
settlement.

 In terms of structure, ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its 
responsibilities. ASMAE  is the organization in charge of developing MAE's 
basic operational functions, such as metering, contract registering, spot 
price calculation and financial settlement. It also has a role in developing 
the MAE rules, an effort which started in November 1998 and has not yet come 
to fruition. ASMAE formerly reported to COEX, the MAE Board of Directors, 
According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line 
relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic 
organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors.

 In terms of governance, ANEEL has terminated COEX, a 26 stakeholder Board in 
charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules. The Resolution was 
effective immediately. In lieu of COEX, ANEEL has created COMAE, a new 6 
member professional  Board, in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE 
rules, on an ongoing basis. COMAE should be operational in two months.  
ANEEL,Distributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each. 
Similarly to COEX, COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly, where 
all stakeholdershave a seat (votes are equally split between generators and 
distributors)

 In terms of MAE rules, ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees. Those 
were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning, but they have never been 
implemented. The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties. 
ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature, the ones 
strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running.

 There is a 60 day period to put the new organization and governance in 
place. In the meantime, ASMAE will continue its routine functions. If doubts 
arise, ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL 


b) INITIAL REACTIONS

 Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions. The Resolutions were 
issued on a Friday, late afternoon, to allow agents to dissipate their anger 
over the weekend. The measures were considered a unilateral "coup-de-etat"  
kind of intervention. A lot of criticism was raised on the "legality" of the 
process. Initial reactions challenged ANEEL's ability to intervene in the MAE 
rules and terminate COEX.

 Similar reactions were expressed the following week. A COEX meeting (void in 
legal terms) was held the following week to verbalize people's angers and 
discuss next steps. An immediate General Assembly was scheduled. Several COEX 
members got really upset. Reasons vary: some are questioning the necessity of 
those actions, although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic 
body. Some COEX member got very emotional: afterall, their hierarchical 
positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted  by being a 
COEX member.  

 ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale 
behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX, whose members 
are motivated by more parochial views. The meeting was useful and most of the 
negative reaction was placated.

 No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL. Most 
stakeholders agree that something had to be done, despite the fact that the 
way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity. The 
issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement, containing the basic mandates 
and addressing utility's concerns.


c) Enron's view

 Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed. Enron has publicly 
and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE 
implementation. In Informativo Regulat?rio # 3, issued back in November 2000, 
we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems. Nothing 
was being decided. COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than 
two years without success. No one (except a few, including Enron) was 
interested in getting MAE up and running. Rather, most agents were interested 
in conforming the MAE rules to meet their ad-hoc individual parochial 
interests. The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear na<ve, 
retreat to objectives. Procrastination was the rule of the game. In sum, COEX 
was not working. The California experience served to surface and enlighten 
the maladies of stakeholder's Board. In several instances, we proposed a 
professional Board and some form of ANEEL's intervention, as it had the 
ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market. R

 ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account. Regulatory Affairs 
is  proud to have influenced  this process. However, we think ANEEL should 
have acted a long time ago. ANEEL now has a sense of urgency. It fully 
understands that a non-functioning market would be an obstacle to anyone's  
building new short term generation, on a merchant basis. This incremental 
generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing. 

  No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a "coup-de-etat". Legally 
speaking, it is also questionable. ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy 
and by other Federally owned generations, who have many votes in the MAE. 
Despite those deficiencies,  we believe the changes are in the right 
direction.

 ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our  individual support as well as to 
use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of (ABRADEE, APINE, 
CBIEE and ABRACEEL), to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market 
Agreement in place. Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility. 
We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is. The only way to proceed is 
to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE 
Agreement, to be signed by all parties. This would require ANEEL some 
willingness to negotiate and compromise. They accepted our suggestion. We 
have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the 
MAE rules, spot pricing and contracts. Our support is contingent on the 
integrity of market and contracts, even during a serious rationing. The 
impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to 
further interfere, set caps on spot and the like.

 We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and 
proposing changes & improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement. 
There are many aspects which need to be clarified/improved in the new 
governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL. For example, the hierarchical 
lines between ANEEL, COMAE, ANEEL, General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need 
clarification. Similarly, the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to 
be implemented.

 We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry 
players, asking for inputs and feedback. No one is really focused on the new 
MAE Agreement. Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time. 
However, we feel that some progress has been made. Coalition groups  are not 
talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds. This is unlikely 
to happen on an individual basis. The situation is relatively  under control.

d) Next Steps
 
 Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger, there is still a long 
way to go. Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions, 
distributed to industry players, should be technically discussed and agreed. 
COMAE members should be appointed: ideally, utilities should agree on the 
COMAE members specs, on a slate of candidates and on a process for final 
COMAE members selection. Finally, a new MAE Agreement should be signed. None 
of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint.  ANEEL has established 
a 60 day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens: ANEEL 
itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they 
are. 

 We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats (one or two) to 
be appointed by traders. So far, this group has not been represented in the 
COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups.  We feel 
traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole 
Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale 
compatition. Collectively, they avoid competition and therefore the 
implementation of the market. Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate 
competition, on a genuine basis.

 All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months.

You may find this interesting. A framework on the "virtuous circle" of 
contracting. It may not be very applicable to the Anglo-Saxon culture. 
However, honoring contracts should not be taken for granted in other 
geographies. There is an underlying message for the Government: if one is to 
be serious and alleviate the rationing crisis, let's start honoring contracts 
and creating a responsible contracting mindset.

Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's 
reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.  (Frist is the NRSC chairman this 
cycle.)  Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, 
the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the 
NRSC's National Finance Chairman.  Present were over a dozen Republican 
senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond 
(MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI).

The "news" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for 
praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their 
new "Majority Makers" program.  This is the effort that Barbour will head up 
to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events 
outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC 
presence.  Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston 
fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total.  Ken was the 
first name he mentioned.  The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan 
and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC.

Needless to say, I was suddenly quite "popular" after Haley made his remarks 
to the assembled group.  Haley said he looked forward to working with us on 
this project.

As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our 
mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told 
Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the 
first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the 
effort.  While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the 
event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an 
educated assumption on my part).

Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was 
present when Haley made his comments.

Interesting that in page 8, regulatory is not present. RAC is acknowledging

Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that 
further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices.  The original 
idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates 
wouldn't go higher.  Neither of these concepts have held true.

I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further 
contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will 
do.  First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers.  
Second, with the "new" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in 
the future won't have a chance.

Appreciate everyone's thoughts?

Jim

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Energy Services, Enron North America and senior management of the company in 
a way that fully reflects Enron's core values.  He has provided and continues 
to provide leadership on complex issues involving business and litigation 
risk.  Jeff has also provided tremendous value to the business units on a 
number of transactions arising from the crisis. 

Steve Walton - Director to Sr. Director:  Steve, as part of the group within 
Government Affairs focusing on wholesale market issues, has provided 
extraordinary leadership with respect to the development of RTO's in the 
Western United States.  Steve's insights and experiences have also proven to 
be invaluable in the group's national efforts.

Lisa Yoho - Director to Sr. Director: Lisa has been a valuable member of the 
Eastern Seaboard team and , more recently has assumed responsibility for 
Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks. Lisa has been an integral team 
member in trying to establish a market for secondary rail transportation

Administrative Coordinator. A special personal note on Ginger. Ginger, in my 
mind, exemplifies and embodies the best of  Enron's vision and values: She 
works hard, produces outstanding results for the group, posesses an attitude 
that is optimistic and fun-loving, and still does an extraordinary job of 
balancing the personal and professional. Ginger, to put it succinctly, is a 
treasure and I am very pleased and proud to recognize her accomplishments.

The Texas statute allows for full collection of stranded costs with a final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004 and interim collection in 2002 and 
2003 based on a Commission estimate.  The Commission bases its estimate of 
stranded costs on the ECOM (Excess Costs Over Market) Model.  The ECOM model 
computes the difference between the revenues a utility would receive in a 
regulated environment versus the revenues a utility would receive if it sold 
all of its generation at market prices (the market price in the ECOM Model is 
based on a Combined Cycle Combustion Turbine). 

In 1998 the Commission estimated more than $4 Billion in stranded costs based 
on the ECOM Model.  Because stranded costs are the difference between the 
market value and the book value of utility generating assets, the Commission 
ordered utilities to "mitigate" stranded costs by increasing depreciation of 
generating assets.  The accelerated depreciation, came from two sources:

 1. Redirected depreciation -- Utilities were allowed to defer depreciation 
of their wires assets and increase depreciation on generating assets; and,
 2. Application of Excess Earnings -- instead of decreasing utility rates the 
Commission set a cap on earnings and directed the utilities to apply any 
earnings above the cap to depreciating generating assets.

Because of the unexpected rise in natural gas prices the market price in the 
ECOM model rose significantly above the weighted average price of the 
regulated side which is weighted by coal and nuclear.  This caused the 2001 
estimate of stranded costs to be severely negative.  Even more negative than 
the amounts of redirected depreciation and application of excess earnings.

Enron argued at the Commission that because the estimate of stranded cost was 
negative the accelerated depreciation was unnecessary.  Consequently, we 
argued that the money spent on mitigation should be used to reduce wires 
rates.  The utilities argued that they should keep mitigation until the final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004.  The Commission ruled in Enron's 
favor.  

Sylvester Turner filed H.B. 2107 to address this situation, however, rather 
than simply reducing wires charges, the bill as filed would reduce utility 
rates making it more difficult to compete.  We are working to amend the bill 
so that the credit for redirected depreciation and excess earnings goes only 
to reducing wires rates and that any negative stranded costs beyond that 
amount would be refunded directly to ratepayers.

Hi, Rick,

I am sorry to have forgotten to copy you on this e-mail I sent to Steve. 
Besides, I have sent another article to Maureen this morning on the danger of 
Californian crisis repeating in Spain (see attached here as well)

Subject: EC documents on California crisis

Steve,

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

Kevin

Here is a summary of the work of this task force.  Bill Rust has been 
attending  the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions.

The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not 
tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from 
native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security.  
This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm 
PTP transactions.  However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) 
requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm 
point-to-point (PTP).  Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been 
utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to 
demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels.  In order to demonstrate 
comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is 
needed.  In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. 

The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load 
dispatch.  

These seven methods can be grouped into three categories:
1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows.
2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to 
sink control area.
3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the 
purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). 

Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an 
interconnection-wide state estimator is not available nor a nodal dispatch 
model.
 
The simplest methods (group 1) adjust each generator individually to a set of 
load points in its control area and repeats until all the units in the 
control area are accounted for.   The problem for the transmission owners 
with this approach is that the netting effects of the real-time dispatch are 
not captured therfore exaggerating the impacts a control area has on its 
neighbors. Group 1 solutions were rejected because the task force beleived 
that its parent, the Security Subcommittee (Dick Ingersoll member) insisted 
on a new procedure that included counterflows - for security reasons.

The initial proposal to include netted effects (Group 2) allows control areas 
to net NNL flows within the control area and PTP to net flows that are 
grouped by sink control area. Group 2 solutions were rejected because PSEs 
would not get credit for off-setting transactions that sink in other control 
areas, e.g. I have a PTP that sinks in TVA that off-sets a PTP that sinks in 
SOCO. Group 2 solutions would not give credit for this.

The most complex method (group 3) allows the native load dispatch to net 
their impacts with all internal gen-load pairings AND nets the contributions 
of point-to-point tagged transactions by PSE.  This is the most equitable 
solution for the market, however it is the most costly and demanding solution 
for the transmission owner/operators. Group 3 solutions were acceptable to 
all parties because it assigned credit to those who are sponsoring 
transactions that relieve the flow gate loading.

Lately, I have been pushed in NERC activities to make calls that boil down to 
what is fair and equitable between native loads and point-to-point service 
vs. what increased burden and accountability on providers is needed to 
provide for that level of comparability.

We should always hold providers to the higher standard.  That is - it is not 
easy to facilitate market transactions, and yes - real people and real 
dollars are needed to be expended by providers to continue facilitating an 
increasingly complex and evolving marketplace.  Providers cannot be let off 
the hook and be allowed to do what is easy and least cost - this has proven 
over and over to have negative impact on the market.

MISSISSIPPI -- BellSouth to file market-entry bid with FCC

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., yesterday notified the Public 
Service Commission it plans to file an application to provide in-
region interLATA (local access and transport area) services with 
the FCC "on or after" Sept. 19.
 
In November 1998 the PSC concluded BellSouth had met the local 
exchange market-opening mandates in section 271 of the federal 
Telecommunications Act of 1996.  BellSouth yesterday submitted 
third-party test results of its Georgia operation support system 
and proposed performance-measurement and penalty plans.  
BellSouth asked the PSC to reaffirm that it has met the Act's 
market-opening requirements.

Compliance with section 271's 14-point "competitive checklist" is 
a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region 
interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department 
of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the 
applications.  (Docket no. 97-AD-321)

FLORIDA -- Broward County repeals 'open-access' requirement

Broward County, Fla.'s County Commission yesterday voted to 
repeal an ordinance that had required cable TV franchisees to 
offer unaffiliated Internet service providers "open access" to 
their cable modem platforms.  The vote puts the final nail in the 
coffin for one of the earliest open-access initiatives.

In 1999, Broward became the second county in the U.S. to adopt an 
open-access requirement following the lead of authorities in the 
Portland, Ore., area.  (7/14/99)  A federal district judge in 
Miami, however, ruled last year that Broward's ordinance violated 
cable TV companies' rights to free speech and expression.  In 
"Comcast Cablevision of Broward County et al. v. Broward County" 
(case no. 99-6934-Civ), Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks was the 
first to rely on the First Amendment in nixing a locality's open-
access ordinance.

While the county's appeal of that ruling was pending before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta), the cable 
TV companies filed a claim seeking attorneys' fees from the 
county, said Terry Bienstock, a Miami attorney with The Bienstock 
Law Firm, P.A., who represented the cable TV companies.

Both sides agreed to a settlement under which the parties would 
drop their legal claims if the board voted to repeal the 
ordinance, Anitra Lanczi, Broward's assistant county attorney, 
told TR.  That agreement prompted yesterday's vote, she said.

CALIFORNIA -- Pacific Bell to report on CLEC operational issues

Public Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has directed Pacific 
Bell to file by May 29 an updated list of operational problems 
recently raised by competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs).  
On April 4-5 Mr. Brown convened a hearing to examine more than 50 
systematic operational problems the CLECs had identified 
concerning ordering, provisioning, post-provisioning, and 
multifaceted issues.

During the hearings and the following six days, Pacific Bell and 
the CLECs met to resolve as many issues as possible.  During an 
April 12 hearing, Pacific Bell presented a status report, which 
set task-completion dates for certain outstanding issues.  

Mr. Brown said he wanted Pacific Bell to update the summary 
regularly to allow the staff to monitor the progress.  The May 29 
summary will identify which issues have been resolved and 
highlight issues affecting more than one CLEC.  Comments on the 
summary will be due June 11.  The staff will compile a final 
summary of the issues by June 21.  

After June 21, and until further notice, Pacific Bell must submit 
a monthly updated issues/action log highlighting the issues that 
were listed in the staff's June 21 final summary.  

The order also directs the staff to inform Mr. Brown by Aug. 3 of 
any progress made toward resolving problems regarding database 
and documentation, installation trouble, and missed due dates.  
The largest number of joint CLEC problems fell under those three 
areas.  The staff also will advise Mr. Brown by Jan. 4, 2002, as 
to what extent the other issues in the June 21 summary have been 
resolved.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043, 
Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)

NEW MEXICO -- PRC to reconsider area code decision

The Public Regulation Commission has voted unanimously to 
reconsider its decision ordering a "split" to relieve number 
exhaustion in the "505" area code.  The commission is drafting an 
order today that will include a schedule for hearings on the 
matter, a PRC staff member told TR.

A group of businesses, citizens, and governmental entities 
calling itself "The '505' Coalition," asked the PRC to reconsider 
the order.  (5/18/01)  The coalition is disappointed with the 
PRC's decision to assign the new "957" area code to the most 
populated areas of the state--Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Los 
Alamos.

The coalition said the PRC violated state law by allowing newly 
sworn in Commissioner Rory McMinn, who hadn't participated in any 
of the public hearings or meetings in the case to cast the 
deciding vote in the matter.  According to the coalition, state 
law (section 8-8-18 NMSA 1978) requires the recusal of a PRC 
commissioner or hearing examiner in any case in which the 
individual is unable to make a fair decision.  The coalition said 
that, according to PRC records, Mr. McMinn or his staff never 
reviewed the case's file.

MASSACHUSETTS -- DTE to defer DSL cost issues

Two Department of Telecommunications and Energy hearing officers 
have granted Verizon Massachusetts' request to defer 
consideration of two digital subscriber line (DSL) cost issues.  
Verizon asked the officers to delay establishing final rates for 
conditioning of loops that meet Carrier Service Area standards 
and final rates for line sharing collocation augment application 
and engineering services.

Verizon said it would be more efficient to address the two issues 
in the DTE's comprehensive TELRIC (total-element long-run 
incremental cost) docket.  The items are the final issues 
remaining in the DTE's 1998 advanced services rate investigation.

Covad Communications Co. opposed Verizon's request.  Covad said 
removing the issues to the TELRIC docket would deprive the 
parties of the extensive record on loop conditioning costs 
developed in the advanced service docket.  Covad also said the 
move would "entail unnecessary time and expense."

The DTE hearing officers said that the collocation and line 
sharing costs are within the scope of the TELRIC docket and that 
any matter contained in the advanced service docket would be 
available to the parties in the TELRIC docket.  The officers also 
noted that the rates proposed by Verizon in the TELRIC docket for 
the two DSL items are lower than the interim rates set in the 
advanced service docket.

Verizon will have to begin offering the lower proposed rates 
immediately, subject to true-up when the TELRIC docket is 
concluded.  (Docket no. D.T.E. 98-57, Phase III)

ARIZONA -- ACC approves price hike

The Corporation Commission has adopted a settlement that 
increases Southwestern Telephone Co.'s business and residential 
rates, sets a 9% rate of return, and increases the company's 
revenue by $20,000.  Southwestern, the commission staff, and the 
Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) were parties to the 
settlement.

Southwestern originally asked for a 9.96% rate of return, based 
on a $3.9 million fair-value rate base (FVRB).  The commission 
staff and the RUCO proposed their own rates of return and FVRBs, 
and the three parties worked together on a settlement.  The 
agreement adopted the staff's proposed FVRB of $4.1 million.

The settlement will raise residential rates by 25 cents to $11.25 
and will raise business rates by 90 cents to $24.90.  
Southwestern serves about 4,600 access lines in the Quartzsite 
and Salome exchanges.  (Docket no. T-01072B-00-0379)

FLORIDA -- NeuStar to release 'growth code' to BellSouth

The Public Service Commission has ordered North American 
Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar, Inc., to release a "growth 
code" to BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., for the Magnolio-
ORLDFLMADS1 switch in the Orlando rate center.

BellSouth requested a growth code to meet a customer's request 
for 2,500 consecutive DID (direct inward dial) numbers in an NXX 
with a four as the last digit (NX4).  NeuStar denied BellSouth's 
request because the company hadn't met the rate center months-to-
exhaust (MTE) criteria required to obtain a growth code.  To 
qualify for a growth code, carriers must have no more than a six-
month inventory of telephone numbers in the rate center.  
BellSouth appealed NeuStar's decision to the PSC.

The commission said the MTE criteria create a disadvantage for 
carriers with multiple-switch rate centers.  One switch in a such 
a center may be near exhaust while the average MTE for the rate 
center is above six months, the PSC said.  When NeuStar denied 
BellSouth's code request, the MTE for the Magnolia-ORLDFLMADS1 
switch was four months.  (Docket no. 010309-TL)

NORTH CAROLINA -- Commission sets number-pooling schedule

The Utilities Commission has ordered Telcordia Technologies, 
Inc., to implement 1,000-number block pooling in the "919" area 
code by Oct. 26.  Number pooling will postpone "for as long as 
possible" the activation of the "984" overlay for the "919" area 
code and the introduction of mandatory 10-digit dialing, the 
commission said.  (Docket no. P-100, Sub 137)

CALIFORNIA -- PUC to mull advice letter procedures

A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked 
interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held 
to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process.  
Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine 
tariff changes.

According to the ALJ, a consequence of the proliferation of the 
telecom industry is that the PUC's "procedures for different 
types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated 
rapidly, sometimes even on a utility-specific basis."  He said 
the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing 
procedures, which are scattered over many decisions and 
resolutions.

The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain 
certain advice letter procedures, but they disagreed about which 
ones should be kept.  The ALJ has asked interested parties to 
respond by June 14 to his questions about advice letter 
procedures that are inconsistent with the commission's general or 
telecom rules.  Commenting parties also must discuss whether and 
why they think a hearing would be warranted.  (Rulemaking no. 98-
07-038, Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order 96-A 
regarding informal filings at the Commission)

ALABAMA -- Rule would revise reporting requirements

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by June 25 
on a proposed rule that would require long distance carriers to 
identify, for informational purposes, their interstate long 
distance per-minute rates in their tariffs.  The proposed rule 
also would require carriers to identify the product name, per-
minute rates, minimum monthly charges, and billing increments 
applicable to intrastate long distance calling plans "within the 
same section under which the service is described in the tariff."

The new rule would help the PSC respond to customer complaints, 
the PSC said.  "Rates associated with the [intrastate long 
distance] plan such as the minimum monthly charge, call duration, 
billing increments, etc., may not be found in the same general 
area of the tariff as the rate schedule," the PSC said.  (Docket 
no. 15957)

NEBRASKA -- Gov. Johanns mulls fiber-optics bill

The Legislature has passed and sent to Gov. Mike Johanns (R.) 
legislation to prohibit governmental agencies or political 
subdivisions from providing telecom service for a fee or from 
becoming certified as contract or common telecom carriers.  
(3/23/01)  The measure would allow governmental agencies or 
political agencies to own, sell, and lease dark fiber.  The 
Public Service Commission would have to approve the lease price 
and profit distribution for governmental bodies leasing dark 
fiber.

Sens. Curt Bromm (Ind., District 23) and Bob Wickersham (Ind., 
District 49) introduced LB 827.

WISCONSIN -- New coalition seeks reliable telecom service

A coalition of Ameritech-Wisconsin customers and competitors has 
formed to "fight for affordable and reliable telephone service."  
The Wisconsin CALLS coalition includes the American Association 
of Retired Persons, the Citizens' Utility Board, the Wisconsin 
Merchants Federation, the Wisconsin Realtors' Association, the 
Wisconsin Apartment Association, and AT&T Corp. as members.

The coalition supports a legislative reform initiative to (1) 
establish specific service standards and penalties for poor 
service by Ameritech, (2) permit customers and competitors to sue 
Ameritech directly when it violates the law, (3) prohibit 
Ameritech from double charging customers and developers for 
connecting new real estate developments to the network, (4) 
impose measure to increase local competition, and (5) order 
structural separation of Ameritech.

Doug Johnson, senior vice president and general counsel for the 
Wisconsin Merchants Federation, said, "Our members depend upon 
the reliability and affordability of the local telecommunications 
system.  In the past year they have suffered major economic 
damage as a result of loss of service, slow response time, and 
high prices for basic service.  And since there is little or no 
local phone competition, our members have no alternatives."

ILLINOIS -- CUB urges commission to order Ameritech rate cut

The Citizens Utility Board yesterday renewed its call for the 
Commerce Commission to reduce Ameritech-Illinois' rates by $957 
million.  CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing 
examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing 
the company's alternative regulation plan.  (5/22/01)

A review of Ameritech's finances conducted by CUB and other 
consumer agencies found that the company "has underreported its 
revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings 
and ward off any rate reduction."  When the company's books are 
adjusted for those discrepencies, CUB said, the study shows rates 
should be reduced by $957 million, a decrease that would save the 
typical customer $120 a year.

CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said, "The hearing examines 
ignored all the evidence showing that Ameritech's rates are 
excessive.  But we've seen the ICC overrule their hearing 
examiners on many occasions.  We look forward to arguing our case 
directly to the ICC in the coming weeks."

The ICC is scheduled to rule on the hearing examiners' proposed 
order in July, according to CUB.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC adopts service-termination rules

The Public Service Commission has adopted rules governing service 
termination by competitive local exchange carriers.  The rules, 
which were first adopted on an emergency basis in March, also 
modify existing regulations on tariff reviews, certification, and 
annual reviews.  (3/30/01)

The rules will take effect when they are posted in the D.C. 
Register.  (Formal case no. 892, Approval of Competitive Local 
Exchange Carriers to Provide Telecommunications Services in the 
District Order no. 12000)

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC wants comment on subloop UNEs

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by May 29 
identifying subloop elements that Verizon Washington DC, Inc., 
must include in unbundled network element (UNE) cost studies due 
July 16.  (5/2/01) 

The PSC said Verizon and AT&T Corp. disagree as to whether a loop 
concentrator is a subloop element, which must be unbundled.  
Verizon argued that it isn't and that the FCC requires it to 
unbundle only two subloop elements--the loop distribution and the 
loop feeder.

The PSC said, "Verizon is incorrect in asserting that the FCC 
only included two subloop elements as UNEs; in fact the FCC 
requires all subloop elements to be unbundled."  The problem, the 
PSC said, is that there isn't a list of subloop elements.  
Although AT&T argued that the loop concentrator qualifies, "AT&T 
didn't define the term or explain its function," the PSC said.

Once parties provide a list defining each subloop element and 
explaining their functions, the PSC will set a final list of 
elements.  Verizon will have to provide costs for those elements 
in its UNE cost studies.  (Order no. 12004, Formal case no. 962, 
In the Matter of the Implementation of the District of Columbia 
Telecommunications Competition Act of 1996 and Implementation of 
the Telecommunications Act of 1996)

VERMONT -- PSB orders number pooling

The Public Service Board has ordered telecom carriers to begin 
1,000-number block pooling by May 1, 2002.  The PSB said although 
its single area code, "802," isn't in immediate danger, it still 
may be susceptible to premature number exhaust.  

The board noted a recent request for 98 central office codes 
advanced 802's projected exhaust date from 2011 to 2007.  The PSB 
said two more similar requests would exhaust the available number 
supply completely.

The board plans to select an interim number-pooling administrator 
within two months.  The PSB said it would establish a cost-
recovery mechanism before pooling begins and appointed a hearing 
officer to oversee the docket.  (Docket no. 6505, Investigation 
into Area Code Relief for the State of Vermont)

TEXAS -- WorldCom objects to SW Bell listing increase

WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Utility Commission to reject 
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s tariff increasing its directory 
assistance (DA) listing rates.  In an informational tariff 
filing, SW Bell increased its wholesale DA listing rates from 
0.11 cents to 4 cents per initial listing.  Informational tariffs 
take effect soon after filing, unless a party objects to it.

The PUC set cost-based rates for SW Bell's wholesale DA listings 
in separate dockets.  SW Bell said its DA listings should be made 
available at "market-based" rates consistent with the FCC's Feb. 
17, 2000, unbundled network elements (UNEs) order.  

WorldCom said the PUC's cost-based rates are permitted by the 
FCC's directory listings and UNEs orders.  (Docket no. 24142)

KANSAS -- SW Bell to reprint directory

Because of a publishing error, Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. 
omitted about 20,000 residential and business listings from its 
Shawnee Mission directory, which includes listings for Overland 
Park.  SW Bell has distributed more than 200,000 copies of the 
directory to customers in eastern Johnson County.  It plans to 
redistribute corrected directories "as soon as possible," a SW 
Bell spokesperson told TR.

VIRGINIA -- New '434' area code debuts June 1

North American Numbering Plan administrator, NeuStar, Inc., has 
assigned "434" to the area carved from the "804" area code last 
year.  The State Corporation Commission ordered the change in 
December 2000 when it opted for a "split"/"overlay" combination 
plan to relieve the impending number shortage in the 804 area.  
(12/4/01)

The 434 code will be launched June 1, marking the beginning of a 
seven-and-a-half month permissive-dialing period.  Mandatory use 
of the new code will begin Jan. 15, 2002.  The 434 code will 
serve areas to the south and west of the Greater Richmond area, 
including the cities of Charlottesville, Danville, and Lynchburg.

The 804 area code will continue to serve the Greater Richmond 
area, as well as the town of West Point and communities on the 
upper and middle peninsulas.  Verizon Virginia, Inc., said the 
change will have no effect on rates or local calling areas.

OREGON -- PUC opens certificate-transfer rulemaking

The Public Utility Commission yesterday opened a rulemaking on 
transferring to other carriers certificates of authority to 
provide telecom service, a PUC staff member told TR.  The 
commission doesn't have any rules on this issue.  (5/21/01)

The staff already has drafted a proposal based on the existing 
requirements for obtaining a certificate.  The proposal would 
require both parties to a transaction to file a joint 
application.  According to the staff, this would ensure that both 
parties concur with the specifics of the transfer.

The transfer applications also would be considered on an 
expedited basis.  The draft rules would abolish the proposed 
order and exceptions process in these cases, eliminating 36 days 
from the proceeding.

The commission scheduled a July 23 workshop and a Sept. 24 
hearing to receive input on the proposed rule.  (Docket no. AR 
415)

WISCONSIN -- Measure would prohibit 'spamming'

Rep. Steve Foti (R., Oconomowoc) and Sen. Mary Panzer (R., West 
Bend) yesterday announced that they are introducing legislation 
to protect consumers from unsolicited e-mail advertising, known 
as "spam."  Under AB 416, a person would have to include the 
letters "ADV" at the beginning of the message to indicate to the 
receiver that the e-mail is an advertisement.

E-mail advertisements also would have to include a toll-free 
number or return e-mail address so the recipients could respond 
and ask to have their e-mail addresses removed from the 
distribution list.

GEORGIA -- Teleport offers credits for term commitments

Teleport Communications Atlanta, Inc., is offering a $2,500 
equipment credit to business customers who order a new T-1 and 
sign a three-year agreement.  Teleport also is offering a one-
month credit of monthly recurring charges to T-1 customers who 
commit to bill at least $500 in combined local and intraLATA 
(local access and transport area) service per month and sign a 
one-year term agreement.

The promotions apply to customers who order service between June 
1 and Dec. 31.

MICHIGAN -- Companies launch Internet services in Detroit

Qwest Communications International, Inc., today announced that 
it's offering digital subscriber line Internet connections to 
Detroit area businesses.  The service reaches almost 60% of the 
area's small business market.  In the second quarter, the company 
plans to initiate service via a local fiber network in Detroit to 
provide customers with direct access to its high-speed global 
broadband Internet network at speeds up to 10 gigabits per 
second.

Also today, Focal Communications Corp. announced that it recently 
launched its Internet eXchange service in Detroit.  The service 
allows customers to bypass Internet bottlenecks by offering 
direct access to multiple global backbone providers, Focal said.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC cancels service-quality meeting

The Public Service Commission has cancelled the June 5 meeting of 
its Local Exchange Carrier Quality-of-Service Working Group.  
Group member Verizon District of Columbia, Inc., earlier this 
month said the working group wouldn't be able to make May 
deadlines for submitting a draft performance-assurance plan and a 
report summarizing lost-order trouble tickets.

The PSC established new due dates for the group's reports.  The 
draft performance assurance plan is due June 8, the lost-order 
trouble ticket report is due June 22, and a draft performance 
metric change management plan is due July 6.  The PSC said its 
staff would reschedule the June 5 meeting "at a time that is 
convenient to the working group members."  (Formal case no. 990, 
In the Matter of Development of Local Exchange Carrier Quality of 
Service Standards for the District)

Confirming earlier indications, at about 3 pm EDT today, Chairman Tauzin 
convened the committee to issue a joint statement with Rep. Waxman and then 
recessed the committee subject to the call of the chair following the 
Memorial Day Week Recess.  Congress will not return until the week of June 4, 
but staff level discussions will likely occur after the three-day weekend.

Chairman Tauzin said that the committee is receiving conflicting information 
on the facts in California.  He said it is better to take a little longer to 
get the facts straight and evaluate various options, rather than act quickly 
but in the wrong way.  He did say he expects that the committee will come to 
a bipartisan agreement after the recess.

Behind the scenes, we hear that Democrats appear not to want to reach an 
agreement, instead preferring to keep the issue alive.  Republicans, on the 
other hand, want to spare their vulnerable West Coast Members another 
recorded vote against price caps.  Thankfully, following our collective 
efforts yesterday, the discussion has moved off of the 80/20 long term 
contract requirement.  Republicans are poised to offer the Ose bill as an 
alternative for discussion and amendment if an agreement is not reached.  The 
Ose bill would extend FERC's pricing formula to 24/7 and throughout the West.

Staff report that Members were far from agreement and that no one concept was 
embraced for further refinement.  It does appear, however, that some Members, 
such as Rep. Mary Bono (R-CA) are pushing for some type of price mitigation 
that they can vote for.  With Republicans increasingly worried about the 
political impact of the energy issue, we will need to continue our work next 
Tuesday, starting with an in-depth analysis of the Ose bill.

Cynthia:

Here's a memo Scott Bolton put together which reflects his thoughts on a 
broad EBS Washington strategy for next year.  I commented on it before it 
went out.  It's still a work in progress.

Item 3 in particular might be of interest tomorrow when you participate in 
Pres-elect Bush's Commerce Department transition team meeting.  

We would propose consolidating the funding of high-cost telecommunications 
infrastructure within NTIA at Commerce.  This idea was floated a few weeks 
ago by industry, but received luke warm support.  It would serve our 
interests well in moving toward a coordinated federal broadband strategy, 
which we could more effectively target and influence.

Thanks, and good luck.

Steve

Mr. Shapiro,

I would like an opportunity to gain practical experience in the Governmental 
Affairs group you are heading up for Enron.  My background at Enron has lead 
me through two emerging companies, Azurix and Enron Broadband Services, both 
of which faced and are facing regulatory and legislative issues.  Currently, 
I am rotating through the Analyst/Associate program in business development 
roles, but have a strong desire to work for a group that helps shape our 
commercial deals.  I have been speaking with both Rocky Storie and Allison 
Navin about this area of Enron and I would appreciate it if I could meet with 
someone from your team in the Houston office.  

Attached is a copy of my resume.  I am in the process of looking for my next 
rotation towards the end of this summer and would like to know if there are 
any opportunities within your group.




Regards,

Melanie King

Dear Linda,

 
I haven't been formally introduced to you, although I have seen you several 
times in the Houston offsites.  In the past 16 months, I have been working in 
Government and Regulatory Affairs group covering EBS global telecommunication 
issues.  Currently,  I am on secondment in London to help Jan Haizmann with 
European and Asian telecommunication licensing procedures. This September, I 
will be starting the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS) master program in Washington DC.  I have a strong interest in staying 
with the government affairs group and believe that a part time position in 
the Enron DC office will be complementary to my studies at SAIS. Rick Shapiro 
encouraged me to contact you directly, suggesting that you might be willing 
to meet with me and to help me identify the employment opportunities in the 
DC office.

It may be helpful for you to know that I have been working for the past two 
year for Enron. While in Houston, I had the chance to work on number of 
interesting projects, including providing financial modeling support for the 
former Enron International group.  I am familiar with deregulation process, 
especially with the recent developments in the telecommunication field.   In 
addition, working in the London office have provided me with the opportunity 
to working with the EU Commission, the UK Parliament and other lobbying 
groups.  I believe that my experience in Enron will enable me to play a 
proactive role in the DC office.   

I will be in touch with you by phone in a week.  Next month, I will be 
passing through DC & would like to set up a short 20-30 minute meeting with 
you at a mutually convenient time. 

I understand you are busy and appreciate your time. I look forward to talking 
with you soon.

Sincerely,


Xi Xi

John, as requested, I attach a note on the impact of the upcoming election 
for LDP party president.

LDP President Election. The bottom line is that the outcome of the election 
is unlikely to adversely impact the pace of energy sector deregulation in 
Japan. There are a couple of reasons:
(a) the LDP is a status quo party  - no single leader is powerful enough to 
radically change the policy direction of the party; and
(b) the LDP represents only one pillar of the policy making triangle, which 
includes the bureaucracy and large industry.

However, the choice of leader will impact market sentiment and the Japanese 
economy as a whole, which in turn will have an indirect impact on the pace of 
reform.



Basic Energy Law Bill. John, you are probably starting to see press on the 
progression of the Basic Energy Law Bill. The Bill recently moved up for 
consideration by the LDP Energy sub- committee, the committee headed by Mr Y 
Kamei. We are still confident that the Bill will not pass beyond Mr Kamei's 
committee. Mr  Y Kamei and METI are opposed to the Bill. In addition, there 
is growing opposition from politicians representing environmental and 
anti-nuclear interests.

In the unlikely event that the Bill does receive the approval of Mr Kamei's 
committee, its passage is likely to be delayed until after the election for 
party president and the upper house elections in July. Further, the Bill is 
currently in summary form and will need to be drafted in full, with due 
consideration given to the impact on existing laws, a process that takes some 
time.

In the meantime, our lobbying efforts continue:
The US Government is fully briefed and stands ready to intervene if the Bill 
progresses further. In addition, the USG voiced their opposition to the Bill 
last week during a visit to Washington by the promoter of the Bill, Mr Kanno 
a member of the LDP and an ex TEPCO VP.
The Nikkei newspaper is likely to run an editorial on the Bill in the next 
week or so, aided by information from Enron.
We are using our position in the "new entrants" group to lobby the Japanese 
Government.
We continue to keep Y Kamei informed on an informal basis.

Transmission Access.
Following on from our discussion last Thursday, Enron Japan will be making an 
application almost immediately with Kyushu Electric for transmission access 
in connection with a transaction Morton Eric is running. The transaction will 
raise several regulatory issues and, if successful, will give us an SSEUB 
"licence" and access to the economic power exchange (Keizai Yuzu).

kind regards

Amr is really getting his hands around EES' risk and helping move information

		 Subject: EES Position at the customer/utility level. 

Colleagues:

GA Support Services and Risk Analytics Groups shall communicate, shortly, a 
system that shall allow you to have a monthly update on EES positions in your 
service territories.  The system shall also provide the position to ad-hoc 
requests as needed.
  
The update shall be on monthly basis, and could be customized as per your 
needs/requests.    The primary sources can provide the following:
The position (long, short, and net) in electric utility "x"
The position (long, short, and net) per customer in the electric utility "x".
The position (long, short, and net) per rate schedule/customer class in 
electric utility "x".
Aggregates of the above per State, NERC Region, and Customer.

GA Support, and Risk Analytics aim at providing the data on a 
request-by-request basis in a user initiated system.  The Team is working on 
building a system to answer your data request within 180 working minutes of 
receiving it.  You shall receive an email of the persons to contact with 
their coordinates (e.g., telephone numbers, location...etc.) shortly.   

In designing this system, the Team is constrained by the EES stringent 
request to guarantee that no third party can have access to data.  Part of 
this concern  is mitigated by the request-by-request approach followed as it 
will communicate the lowest level of disaggregated data.  Your utmost care in 
dealing with these data, in my opinion, should satisfy any remaining concerns 
for EES.     

This the  beginning of a longer series of products and services in the 
pipeline.  The Team is keen to know your opinion, and advice.  Any advice on 
the likely frequency of needing this data, the level of details/aggregation 
will be greatly useful and appreciated.   


Best regards

Rick:   We should talk about this at some point.  Our international trading 
business is growing by leaps and bounds, and I am trying to get systems in 
place to manage this BEFORE it gets totally out of control.

I will follow up re the attached email with each of you.  Lisa, if you have 
not met Del, Dan and Ian--who are responsible for EIM logistics--we should 
all get together to discuss the regulatory implications of our increasingly 
physical trading business.. Regards,  Julia

Julia - I think this is a huge issue, and I've been trying to get to the 
bottom of whether or not Enron is importer of record on its trades into the 
US.   Let's discuss when you have a minute.  Thanks, Lisa

		 Subject: Importer of Record

Lisa and Dan (and Tim):

Dick Belanger and I talked about the importer of record question we
discussed in this morning's telephone call.   For a trading company such as
Enron, that is importing products made by other companies, there is not much
advantage to being importer of record.  The one legal advantage is that the
importer of record can challenge actions taken by the US Customs Service,
such as misclassification or valuation issues.   There do not appear to be
other legal rights that Enron would sacrifice by not being importer of
record.  

However, the issue may not be whether Enron should be the importer of
record, but whether it can avoid being importer of record.  Particularly in
today's steel market, other parties may not be willing to be importer of
record for exactly the reason Stelco indicated -- no one wants to expose
themselves to the possibility of antidumping duties.   Thus, although Enron
could structure a deal in which, for example, Stelco sold to Enron Canada,
and Enron sold the steel to a US customer, with that customer acting as
importer of record, with the possibility of a o201 investigation and/or
AD/CVD cases lurking on the horizon, the customer may not be willing to
expose itself to the possibility of future AD/CVD duties, and hence would be
unwilling to act as importer of record.    

If Enron can find someone else who is willing to act as importer of record,
you would protect yourself better by structuring the deal that way.   The
question is whether you can find someone to be importer of record.

Feel free to call if you have any questions.

Regards,

Betsy

Cal-ISO/FERC -2: Companies Allegedly Gamed Power Market
Updated: Friday, June 8, 2001 05:29 PM ET   Email this article to a friend!

 Printer-friendly version

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has
filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power
suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates
because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke
Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR,
news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified
by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence
electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market.

The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system,
recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and
Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited
excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to
charge market-based rates for their power supply.

Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received
the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  "We've obviously just
got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our
own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in
California and prices have come down," Williams said.

Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are
"nothing new."  "It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have
been raised against other generators," Wheatley said. "The ISO is incorrect
in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be
an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting
solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be
affected by finger pointing."

Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor
"strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to
break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market."

The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June 28 Dynegy's ability to charge
market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to
schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy company's
production costs.  The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions
of dollars, retroactive to May 1, "of the difference between cost-based
rates...and the market revenues actually received."  Similar requests were
made with FERC against Duke, Reliant and Mirant.

"The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market
power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged...," according
to the filing.  In the filing, generators have also been accused of
"megawatt-laundering," in which suppliers sell power out-of-state that is
resold to California at a higher price.

California consumers have spent $7 billion for wholesale electricity in
1999, $27 billion in 2000 and could pay as much as $50 billion this year.

Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel, said he is "optimistic" the
state will prevail "in one forum or another and will be able to get the
relief we're seeking."  He said FERC should implement an "effective" market
mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power
prices.  FERC set up a market mitigation plan, which went into effect June
1, to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below
7%. Robinson said that plan wasn't good enough.

Wholesale power prices were at a seven-month low Thursday, due in part to
the new FERC plan, cooler temperatures, low natural-gas prices, and
conservation measures, energy officials said.

Every three years, FERC reviews generators' ability to charge market rates
for electricity. Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three
years ago, but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from
their right to charge market prices.

On the one NE and Southeast orders:

Feel good, guys.  After getting Sarah's call, the traders, including Kevin 
and Dana, said "Awesome" "Great Job" "Way to go" "You've got to feel good", 
plus some whoops for Gov't Affairs!!  Clearly, the most happy yelling I've 
heard about FERC orders in a long time!

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.

Becky --

Pls take the lead in coordinating our response to these requests.

It is critical that legal litigation counsel (Richard Sanders and Bob 
Williams) see and approve the responses before sending to FERC.

Thanks,

Jim

This transaction was a real pleasure to work on.  It is a 12 month 
all-requirements contract with Central Maine Power Company for their 
medium-sized commercial customers.

Once again the model of a cross-functional team was successfully employed.  
John Llodra was the lead originator with support from George Wood 
(mid-market), Janice Moore (legal) and myself.  The four of us participated 
in numerous meetings with both the counterparty and with the regulatory 
commission overseeing the procurement process with the ultimate result of 
having our contract approved and executed the same day.  I am told the deal 
booked $10m for ENA.

Contratulations on the execution of the Central Maine SOS deal! This is 
another great example of what we can do when everyone comes together to get 
something done. This transaction brings both strategic value to the business, 
nice positions for the book and quite a nice chunk of change as well! 

Great job guys!

Here are the Sithe talking points.  I would suggest that you give the person 
making the call the attached note re Ontario, so he or she has more 
background on the Ontario market.

I would also consider letting Jeff know the following:  1.  We have pending a 
complaint against SCE at the PUC to compel SCE to pay the negative CTCs to 
us.  ALJ and Commissioner for Complaint are same ALJ/Comm. proposing this 
treatment.  So no chance of different outcome there.  2.  SCE should drop its 
"affiliate market abuse" counterclaim that it filed in that proceeding.  3.  
Proposed order also implies that no cash payment--only bill credit--will be 
recognized for negative CTC.  [no suggesting mentioning this to Bryson].  4.  
Mike Day raised another alternative which would be that, for now, just get 
SCE to support "bifurcation" and deferral of negative CTC issue and then 
enter negotiations on payment afterwards.

Subject: Re: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE - CPUC Decision

First cut response to Jim's message - see below.  Please respond to me ASAP.

ISSUE:  Enron's PX credits with SCE of $---- million may be "stranded" if a 
PUC proposed decision is approved, as is expected to occur Thursday, June 28.

SCE stopped making PX credit payments January 5, 2001, supposedly because of 
its financial situation.  SCE asked the PUC for authority to reflect the 
accumulated credits on the customer's bill, and suspend any cash payments of 
such credits  The proposed decision grants this request.

SCE has also asked the PUC to formally clarify the manner in which PX credits 
are calculated.  Prior to January 19, 2001, the PX credit was based on the 
actual Power Exchange clearing prices.  On January 19, 2001, the Power 
Exchange effectively stopped operations.  SCE's proposal is to determine the 
PX credit post-January 19, 2001 as the weighted average of its own retained 
generation and QF contract costs.  The PUC has not yet said when it would 
rule on this issue.  Enron's position before the PUC is that the credit 
should continue to be based on a market measure, like NP 15 and SP 15 indices.

Enron's P X credits with SCE could become "stranded" if they are interpreted 
to accrue to the account of the individual customers receiving service and 
not Enron.   Once Enron's customers were re-sourced back to the utility, new 
account numbers were established for these accounts.  This creates a loophole 
which allows SCE and the PUC to interpret the accumulated credits as applying 
to specific customer accounts and not to services purchased by Enron. 

Core Issues for a settlement with SCE on PX credit issue:

Cash payment of owed PX credits through January 18, 2001.  (For Enron, this 
is $123 million.)

Agreement to use SCE-proposed method of PX credit calculation starting 
January 19, 2001.  (Enron drops market proposal.)

PX credits accrued starting January 19, 2001 can be paid in the form of bill 
credits to any account so designated by the Energy Service Provider for 
receipt of such credits.  (Enron credits are transferable to services 
rendered for other Enron customers.)
 
Other SCE debts (????) are not called in immediately.

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1. Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's 
request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  
Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC 
decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on 
Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the 
Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

APPROPRIATIONS
With Few Exceptions, House Approps Panels To Follow Bush Lead
   The House Appropriations Committee has developed subcommittee
spending allocations for FY02. While essentially in line with
President Bush's requests, they differ in some cases by billions
of dollars. In allocations being released today, House
appropriators are recommending $3 billion more than Bush wanted
for Labor-HHS, $1.1 billion more for VA-HUD and $1.2 billion more
for Energy and Water.
   The so-called 302(b) allocations, which the Appropriations
Committee should mark up by next week, divide the $661.3 billion
set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary
appropriations among the 13 Appropriations subcommittees. The
proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in
April, however, were based on his request that total FY02
spending be kept to $660.6 billion.
   The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee. All
numbers are expressed in budget authority, followed by the Bush
administration proposal:
   Agriculture: $15.5 billion, compared to the Bush proposal of
$15.4 billion. Commerce-Justice-State: $38.5 billion, compared to
$37.9 billion. Defense: $300.3 billion, $301 billion. District of
Columbia: $380 million, $300 million.
   Energy and Water: $23.7 billion, $22.5 billion. Foreign
Operations: $15.2 billion, the same as Bush proposed. Interior:
$18.9 billion, $18.1 billion. Labor-HHS: $119.7 billion, $116.4
billion.
   Legislative Branch: $2.9 billion, $3 billion. Military
Construction: $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion. Transportation: $14.9
billion, $16.2 billion. Treasury-Postal: $16.9 billion, $16.6
billion. VA-HUD: $84.2 billion, $83.1 billion.
   Meanwhile, on the FY01 front, House Appropriations Chairman
Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., both said Thursday that they intend to stick to
the president's supplemental appropriations recommendation,
despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush
administration's nearly $7 billion FY01 supplemental spending
request shortchanges the military.
   The supplemental would provide a total of  $6.1 billion for
defense, partially offset by $505 million in defense cuts.
   House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called the request "totally inadequate,"
saying the needs are at least $10-15 billion.  Congress ought to
provide more money using an emergency designation, he said.
   But constrained by the budget caps and the administration's
admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation,
Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the
president's requested level.
   "We've got to be in the real world," said Lewis.
   The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but
not counted against the cap.
   Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as
early as next week and conference with the Senate by July 4th.
   Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental, Chief
Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt, R-Mo., one of the
administration's allies on the Hill, said the president would be
eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto.
   "The president won't be hesitant to veto an early bill," Blunt
said. "I think they're looking for an early opportunity to show
their commitment to discipline on spending. I wouldn't be at all
surprised, if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental,
[to see a veto]."
   In the Senate, where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday
with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would
stick with the president's overall number on the supplemental.
   Daniels, who has insisted that the FY01 supplemental be kept
to "true current-year needs" and stay within the budget caps,
defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress.
   "I think Congress is going to see that these items are about
the right ones," Daniels said. -- By Lisa Caruso

HOUSE LEADERSHIP
Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House
   Despite Minority Leader Gephardt's plea this week for a new
era of bipartisan collaboration, the Democratic takeover of the
Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in
the House, according to House Republican leaders with close ties
to the Bush White House.
   In fact, one key leader, House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy
Blunt, R-Mo., said House Republicans feel liberated to pass
legislation more to their liking.
   "Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased
opportunity to get our work done without having to give
overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate," Blunt
said. "Not that we won't be considerate, but there won't be
overwhelming consideration. Previously, we held back on some
things in consideration of Senator Lott's challenges."
   Blunt, who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans
and the White House, said he expected the House to pass an energy
bill, a prescription drug benefit, a campaign finance reform
measure--and perhaps legislation to make permanent this year's
package of tax cuts--all before the August recess.
   "These will all be placed on Mr. Daschle's desk before we go
home for the August break," Blunt said, suggesting the pressure
will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with
bills backed by the House and President Bush.
   House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the
balance of the year in an interview Thursday--mentioning energy,
prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a
patients' bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade
negotiating authority as top priorities.
   He also spoke favorably about a cost-of-living increase for
members of Congress, a subject he discussed earlier in the day
with Gephardt. Lawmakers "ought to be able to keep up with the
cost of living so that they can take care of their families and
provide for their families like everybody else does,'' Hastert
said. "I think that's the decent thing to do.''
   Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs House GOP leadership
meetings, told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference
since Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., decided last month to bolt the
Republican Party was "a little more sensitivity by the White
House and our leadership in reaching out to moderates...Where you
might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we
are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings."
   Gephardt said this week that Jeffords' move could "embolden"
GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats.
   But Portman, who served in the administration of Bush's father
and has strong ties to the current White House, noted that
moderate GOP Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the
elected leadership as Conference secretary.  And Rep. Doug Ose,
R-Calif., serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP
leadership.
   "We've already formalized something that the Senate
[Republicans] are just now formalizing," Portman said in
reference to the appointment of Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., as the
moderates' representative within leadership. Portman did not
indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership
was imminent.
   In the two weeks since Jeffords' switch, House Republican
moderates have praised Hastert's leadership of and played down
any tensions within their Conference.
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., for example, said he thought the
Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength
as a master of compromise--but, in the meantime, expressed
confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda.
   "Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was, `Our
views are being taken into consideration,'" Blunt said, pointing
to efforts by Reps. Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, among others, to persuade Jeffords to stay put.
   Gephardt this week said he stood "with olive branches in both
hands," but that the House Republican leadership has stiff-armed
Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels.
   "Civility has been improved, but we haven't had real
bipartisanship," Gephardt told reporters.
   House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those
olive branches, but they did make clear that they have a
different definition of bipartisanship.
   "Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the
first six months [of 2001]," said one White House aide, who noted
that Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, has been keeping
score of all the meetings with Democrats. "Clinton's numbers [of
meetings with Republicans] just pale in comparison....We did a
lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and we'll
just keep on doing it."
   Portman said: "I don't buy [Gephardt's] premise. The two most
important bills, education and taxes, were not rammed through on
party-line votes."
   But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative
House Democrats reiterated that group's complaint that
Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development
of legislation.
   The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has
made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy.
   A House Democratic leadership source said: "It's been clear
for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed
any interest in bipartisan cooperation. It may take them awhile
to come around."
   The source said the problem extended to the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue, as well, declaring, "The president has given
Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames, and he's
given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice
Department." -- By Charlie Mitchell

HOUSE RACES
Largent Will Resign From House, Calls For Early Special Election
   Setting the stage for the House's seventh special election
this year, Republican Rep. Steve Largent announced Thursday that
he will resign his Tulsa-based 1st District seat in November to
concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor.
   "It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a
full-time endeavor in the months ahead," Largent said.
"Therefore, today I announce my plan to resign ... on Nov. 29,
exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress."
   Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov. Frank
Keating to pass a law in the Legislature's upcoming special
session, to schedule a special election before Largent's
effective resignation date.
   "I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them
to allow the election to take place prior to my actual
resignation, as was done in 1994 with [former Democratic Sen.]
David Boren's departure from the U.S. Senate," Largent said.
   "This action would ensure that the 1st District is never
without representation in Washington," Largent said.
   Largent, formerly a record-setting wide receiver for the
Seattle Seahawks, entered the House when GOP Sen. James Inhofe
resigned the House seat to assume Boren's Senate seat.
   During his tenure, Largent has earned a reputation as a
champion of Christian conservative causes. He has occasionally
bucked his party's leadership and supported the 1997 coup attempt
against former House Speaker Gingrich. He unsuccessfully
challenged House Majority Leader Armey in 1998.
   In his resignation announcement, Largent said he would remain
neutral in the GOP primary, which already has grown contentious
in anticipation of Largent's gubernatorial run.
   The Republican field for Largent's seat includes state Rep.
John Sullivan, state Sen. Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady
Cathy Keating, the wife of the Republican governor, whose term is
up in 2002.

   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia Thursday called the seat "strongly Republican,"
noting that Largent never had received less than 62 percent of
the vote in the district.
   Nonetheless, at least two Democrats have considered entering
the race.
   Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely
Democratic nominee, while former Tulsa County Democratic Party
leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run.
   Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma
Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats
they can win the seat, but he was confident about the prospects.
   "That seat is competitive for Democrats," Parmley said. "Make
no mistake about it."
   During the 107th Congress, the deaths of Reps. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., Norman Sisisky, D-Va., and Joe Moakley, D-Mass., have
necessitated special elections.
   Largent joins former Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., in retirement announcements.
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., also is expected to resign his
seat to accept a position in the Bush administration (see related
article, below). -- By Mark Wegner

JUDICIARY
Hutchinson's Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation
   The impending departure of Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose
nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is
expected to be confirmed by the Senate, has left the business
community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive
bill to limit legal liability for business.
   Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by
the National Federation of Independent Business and the National
Association of Wholesalers. It would cap punitive damages for
small businesses and for product sellers.
   Introduced last month, the bill restricts punitive damages
against businesses with fewer than 25 employees and limits awards
to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or
$250,000, whichever is less.
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate. However, the loss
of Hutchinson, a high-profile member of the House Judiciary
Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform, is a blow for
bill proponents, observers said this week.
   And the loss is even more significant, they say, given the
shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications
for legal reform legislation in general.
   The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most
viable of the pending legal reform measures--on product liability
and class action reform--was considered daunting in a closely
divided Senate. But with Democrats controlling the agenda,
numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing
commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly
impossible.
   At the same time, some observers noted, the bipartisan appeal
of the small business community--combined with President Bush's
expected effort later in his term to advance his civil-justice
reform agenda--could help move the ball on some piecemeal
reforms.
   This is not the first time this year that supporters of
product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional
sponsors: The legislation's sponsors in the past Congress
included former Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., and former Sens. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., all of whom lost
their 2000 re-election bids. -- By Pamela Barnett

LABOR
GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums; Dems Seek New Rule
   House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and
Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood, R-
Ga., praised Labor Secretary Chao's decision to hold three public
forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by
September.
   "We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for
a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing
their jobs or placing America's economy in an ill-conceived
regulatory straightjacket," they said in a joint statement.
   "We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important
issue moving forward and resolved," Chao said Thursday.
   But Democrats were more circumspect.
   "We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination--
that's what we want to avoid," said John Lawrence, minority staff
director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. "If
it's the first step to getting to a rule, then we welcome it."
   Ranking member George Miller, D-Calif., and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., sent a letter to Chao in April, urging her to
issue a new rule. But Chao has not committed herself to doing so.
   After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton
administration ergonomics rules, which would have required
employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced
problems such as repetitive-stress disorders, Chao promised to
review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue.
   The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be
based on are: prevention, sound science, incentive-driven,
flexibility, feasibility and clarity.
   A strong advocate of the Clinton rule, the AFL-CIO is
"analyzing the recent announcement" and will "respond in the very
near future," said Jay Power, the union's legislative
representative.
   Manufacturers, who opposed the Clinton rule, have said in the
past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the
issue.
   The forums will be held in Washington July 16, Illinois July
20 and California July 24. -- By April Fulton

HEALTH
FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs
   As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another
attempt to relax a 1988 law that bars the reimportation of U.S.-
made prescription drugs, federal officials told a House Commerce
subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail
has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the public's
safety.
   "We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing
FDA-regulated products for personal use enter the U.S. each year
through international mail facilities that Customs could set
aside for FDA review for possible violations" of law, FDA Senior
Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House
Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
   Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect,
Hubbard testified, "the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA
does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to
their addresses," despite potential risks.
   Hubbard's testimony included the agency's strongest language
yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of
individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase
prescription drugs from overseas. Such drugs, he said, "may be
contaminated, subpotent, superpotent or counterfeit."
   "FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved
products are effective or safe, or have been produced under U.S.
good manufacturing practices," he testified. "U.S.-made drugs
that are reimported may not have been stored under proper
conditions, or may not be the real product, because the [United
States] does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies."
   In a pilot project in California earlier this year, FDA
examined approximately 1,900 of some 16,000 packages flagged as
suspicious by Customs officials. Hubbard testified that some of
those packages contained drugs that could not be identified,
drugs with labeling only in foreign languages, and drugs that
have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States
by the FDA.
   "Several shipments contained three drugs that were once
approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on
serious safety concerns," he testified.
   Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in
their outrage over the situation.
   For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet, said
Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., "Their motto might
very well be `there's a sucker logging on every minute.'"
   Last month, Greenwood, subcommittee ranking member Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., and Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., toured the
international mail facility at Dulles Airport, and "what we found
was truly frightening," Greenwood said, including pills hidden in
carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection.
   Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell, D-Mich.,
whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to
the 1988 law making reimportation illegal, said the new
information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather
than loosened.
   But while Dingell called last year's legislative attempt to
overturn the 1988 law a "misguided effort to attempt to lower
prices by opening up our borders," he said Congress must
recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because
they cannot afford to buy them in the United States. -- By Julie

HEALTH
Bilirakis Panel `Open-Minded' On Addressing Generic Drug Law
   Although some members of Congress and the brand-name
pharmaceutical companies are skeptical, the House Energy and
Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent
reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting
as a way to save money.
   "We do feel we should learn enough about them [the generic
drug issues]; that's why we're having the hearing next week,"
said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.
   The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues
and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan
"in the next few days" following the hearing, he said.
   "We're trying to stay open-minded," Bilirakis said.
   But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he worries about opening
up the 1984 drug patent law he wrote with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, particularly in the context of a broader Medicare
prescription drug bill.
   "It's not a natural fit," Waxman said.
   However, Waxman said the law might have some problems that
should be addressed.
   These include a 30-month stay that prevents generic products
from coming to market if a brand-name company claims a patent
infringement, and the 180-day period during which the first
producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from
competing with it.
   Hatch and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., now the chairman of
the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where the
issue could pop up on the Senate side, have expressed
reservations about opening the bill in the past.
   The brand-name drug industry has not shown much interest in
revamping the Hatch/Waxman law, but the generic drug companies
argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through
patent challenges.
   But brand-name advocates are bracing for a fight against any
such move. A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America said it "would only jeopardize
prescription drug coverage for seniors."
   Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, recently
introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner.
   Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved
with Democratic control of the Senate, but Senate aides said no
official discussions have taken place since the changeover. -- By

TRADE
EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe, U.S. `Unilateralism'
   Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and
European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday
that President Bush's decision to launch a Section 201
investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next
week's EU-U.S. summit.
   Eliasson, said the steel decision would be "troublesome" to a
planned discussion on how the world's two largest trading
partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round.
   Eliasson, who represents all 15 EU member countries while
Sweden holds the group's presidency for the six months ending
June 30, spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in
advance of the summit in Gothenberg, Sweden.
   Eliasson also said that developing a joint EU-U.S. statement
on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving
to be the most difficult aspect of pre-summit negotiations.
   Eliasson said the Europeans see "no alternative" to continuing
the Kyoto Protocol talks, which Bush has rejected. Eliasson also
said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg.
   Lamy, who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill, told
an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon, "We in Europe do not
accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the [steel]
problem."
   The European Union, he noted, has cut 50 million tons of
capacity and eliminated 750,000 jobs in the steel industry
without introducing import restrictions.
   Lamy said it would serve a purpose "to get the facts of this
troubled world industry out into the open."
   The European Union had proposed to the United States that the
fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic
Development and Cooperation, Lamy said, but never received a
reply to its suggestion.
   Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that
Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade
negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade
talks, Lamy said, "If at the end of the day, the European
steelworkers have to pay this way, I'm not sure the new round
will be very popular in Europe."
   Lamy also said the Europeans "are becoming concerned about
what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic
toward unilateralism."
   Responding to speculation that the United States and the
European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about
launching a new round, Lamy said that would be "premature."
   Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss
foreign policy in the western Balkans, the Middle East and
Russia, the Korean Peninsula, the spread of HIV in Africa, and
the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change. --

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks
   Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on
what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate
will take up President Bush's nominees quickly.
   But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority
Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Thursday that Republicans were
delivering to Daschle a GOP-drafted document dealing with Bush
nominations. Senators said the document would be the basis for
some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal
statement about nominees.
   Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the
statement, the general concepts have been negotiated during two
meetings between Daschle and a five-member GOP negotiating team.
   "The concepts that we've discussed with [Daschle] ... were not
turned down," said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Domenici said the two sides were "getting close," and the GOP
proposal was "trying to reflect the views of all of the senators
that we talked to."
   A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new
organizing resolution Tuesday. That would provide time for the
two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by
the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference, which meet
separately Tuesday.
   Both sides said the process has gone smoothly, a reflection of
a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that
any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement
of nominees. -- By Geoff Earle

Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA
   The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends
to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a six-year term as head of the
Social Security Administration--which pumps out $450 billion a
year to 45 million, mainly elderly, pension recipients.
   Barnhart's appointment as Social Security commissioner is
subject to Senate confirmation.
   The commissioner's job is always a sensitive position because
of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go
out on time and keep the records straight.  But with the
president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible
battle over his plan to introduce personal stock-market accounts
to the system, the job could be even tougher than normal.
   Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs
with strong links to ex-Sen. William Roth, R-Del. She was a
legislative assistant to Roth from 1977-1981 and ran his re-
election campaigns in 1988, 1994 and 2000. She served as
political director of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee during the 1995-96 cycle.
   Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal
government:  Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for
children and families 1990-93. Barnhart is currently a member of
the Social Security Advisory Board, which advises the president,
Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income.

Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling
   Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday
released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the 2000
decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical
sampling.
   Board member David Murray questioned the "post-strata"
adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how
many people live in a specific geographical area.
   "Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from
persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications,
especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the
use of census data," Murray said.
   Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nation's
population and using the common characteristics of people in one
area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other, similar census
blocks.
   Board co-chairman Mark Neuman called the 2000 census "the most
accurate census in history" and said Census Bureau experts were
right to recommend against releasing sampling data for
congressional redistricting.
   Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data, a special
bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled
data, concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more
accurate than traditional data.
   Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that
with more time, statisticians might be able to validate the
sampling data.

TRANSPORTATION
Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements
   House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., has scheduled a June 20 hearing to
give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the
airlines are making in improving customer service.
   The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines'
unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to
improve service, along with an agreement to make these service
commitments legally enforceable by including them in customer
contracts.
   The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved
legislation earlier this year granting airlines limited antitrust
immunity to discuss and coordinate flight schedules; Mica said he
expected a floor vote during the week of July 9. The House
Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill, but the
referral expires July 9.

GOP Lawmakers Introduce Legislation On Monuments
   House Resources Chairman Hansen and nine other lawmakers
announced the filing of the National Monument Fairness Act
Thursday.
   "The American people deserve a voice in how their own public
lands are managed," said Hansen. "The bill gives them that voice.
Under this bill, when a president creates a monument larger than
50,000 acres, he must solicit input from the public and the
affected governor and congressional delegation."
   The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the
monument. After that time, if Congress has not approved the
measure, the president's proclamation sunsets.
   "This means people who don't want a big monument in their
state can talk to their local leaders, their governor or their
congressional delegation," said Hansen.
   At a news conference, Hansen was joined by an original sponsor
of the bill, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with GOP Reps.
George Radanovich of California, Greg Walden of Oregon, Chris
Cannon of Utah, Jim Gibbons of Nevada, Dennis Rehberg of Montana
and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Aleck --

Just wanted to give you some updates from my presentation in Toronto.

1. I used alot of material from Lay's speech.  Changed it a little.  I think 
I did ok (although I referenced airline competition in Canada - something you 
guys haven't yet put in place).

2. The general tone of the day was that Ontario has some more work to do.  It 
doesn't appear that the parties were really ready to move ahead with 
competition.  California wasn't discussed too much.  Many people are worried 
that the rules don't really promote competition - which they don't.

3. OPG indicated at lunch that they want competition, but that it was up to 
the parties in the meeting to make it happen.  Most people were in agreement 
(quietly).

Given the huge value loss for ENA if we don't get it open, I'd like to know 
if there is anything else we can do to help you.   There are some new 
Competitive Analysis guys that may be able to help us find some leverage - 
pls give me a call.  Finally, I saw Lavorato in the airport on the way back 
to Houston.  He is ready to help and recognizes the importance of this 
activity.  I think that he can get Lay and/or Skilling whenever through the 
Summer.

If you can push this through, this is a huge win for Government Affairs.  
This is easily the biggest Regulatory Origination opportunity we have this 
year.  

Jim

FT Energy Article


By Rick Stouffer
rstouffer@ftenergy.com
The electricity supply-demand equation is simple: Match supply to demand an=
d=20
things are dandy. Demand overwhelms supply: build more supply.

Throughout the country, but particularly in California, there is no questio=
n=20
more supply is mandated=01*NIMBY (not in my backyard) be hanged. But what a=
bout=20
the demand side of the issue? What about getting customers involved in the=
=20
solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system?=
=20

'Negawatts' nothing new
Granted, the concept of negawatts is nothing new; it was coined roughly a=
=20
quarter-century ago by the founder of the Boulder-based consulting firm E=
=20
Source: Amory Lovins. Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get=
=20
them through wattage rough spots from time to time.=20

All the existing independent system operators have actively considered=20
demand-side bids at one time or another, according to Richard Rudden,=20
president of the consulting firm R.J. Rudden Associates in Hauppauge, N.Y.=
=20

But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio=
n?=20
Rather than a supply exchange, aka an independent system operator, put in=
=20
place a "demand exchange" where customers could make a choice: Do I produce=
=20
widgets, run my milling machines, build product or take the power I would=
=20
have used, bid it out and see what happens?=20

Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being=20
championed by an unlikely proponent: Reliant Energy Inc.=20

The Houston-based energy giant already has testified in Washington, D.C.,=
=20
concerning the proposal, has had meetings with key Western state government=
=20
leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental=20
groups.=20

The scorecard: Thus far, no one has laughed, no one has walked away from th=
e=20
conversations=01*no one has said "no," according to Reliant's John H. Stout=
,=20
senior vice president of asset commercialization.=20

"You're taking forced, rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption,=
=20
with the customer (that) can take the outage doing so," said Stout.=20

Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J=
oe=20
Barton's Electricity Emergency Assistance bill, but no big generator is=20
pushing from the industry side like Reliant.=20

A demand exchange
Like generators, including Reliant, bidding load into the independent syste=
m=20
operator pool, a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what=
=20
they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price.=20

The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it=
=20
available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). If a=
=20
particular system needed more power, it would contact the clearinghouse,=20
which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped, keeping=
=20
in mind additional transmission charges.=20

Once the bids were identified, the clearinghouse would contact the customer=
=20
and its local control area. The customer would interrupt and the host utili=
ty=20
would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule.=20

One key to the program's success is that no one loses money. The customer=
=20
that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail=20
supplier for what it didn't actually use, and the customer would receive it=
s=20
bid price, times the megawatts curtailed, minus its regular retail charges,=
=20
plus any payment to the transmission provider.=20

"The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin," said William Hogan=
,=20
a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.=
=20

Another key to the Reliant-championed negawatt program is that it is not=20
seasonal; it doesn't lock a potential megawatt-shedder into a long-term=20
contract.=20

"You can bid into the market every day," said Stout.=20

"It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions =
to=20
be made, how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement,"=
=20
said Richard Tabors, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based energy=20
consulting firm Tabors, Carmanis & Associates.=20
As Tabors points out, customers who sell back into the market obviously are=
=20
doing so to play the margin, to make money. But their efforts also will hav=
e=20
a serious impact on the spot market price.=20

"Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesn't have to be=20
produced," Tabors reasoned. "That lowers the marginal cost, the spot market=
=20
cost. It really comes down to what (specific megawatts) are worth to someon=
e=20
and not worth to me."=20

Heavy users thrilled
Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt=20
proposal. "We think it is a well thought-out program. We feel customers hav=
e=20
the right to buy power, they should have the right to sell power and ought =
to=20
be compensated like the generators," said John Anderson, executive director=
=20
of ELCON, the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which represents larg=
e=20
industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector.=20

Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice=
=01*
sound familiar?=01*allowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up =
its=20
power.=20

"This is voluntary. You know when you will be shut down and thus you won't=
=20
incur any damages," said Anderson. "Many proposals tell the customer to cut=
=20
usage, but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down. Command a=
nd=20
control proposals treat everyone alike=01*and they're not."=20

Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t=
he=20
Reliant proposal, with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe=
r=20
Exchange Inc. (APX).=20

"We have had discussions with Reliant; we're in the business of working wit=
h=20
generators," said John Melby, vice president for North American marketing f=
or=20
Santa Clara, Calif.-based APX.=20

According to Melby, APX represents more than half the demand response in th=
e=20
California ISO. He said the company could utilize key computer programs and=
=20
systems previously developed to get the region-wide negawatt program up and=
=20
running.=20

The down side
There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla=
n.=20
Consultant Tabors, for example, pointed to the White House and the Bush=20
administration's seeming preoccupation with supply.=20

Harvard's Hogan said having the power available when needed was key, while=
=20
Reliant's Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai=
l=20
customers from selling load back into the wholesale market. An obvious=20
solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill; however, nothing is=
=20
certain in such a divided Congress.=20

Thus, Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when =
he=20
called a meeting of all California's generators.=20

"We thought he (Davis) generally liked the idea," Stout said.=20

Next up on Reliant's hit list is S. David Freeman, former head of the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power and now Davis' California energy=20
conservation "czar."=20

"We've already raised the issue with him (Freeman), but we're looking to pl=
ug=20
him in," Stout said.=20

The attached document is something of a quick primer on
Flow Gate versus Locational Marginal Pricing (PJM model).

The first portion is a recent article on the two models
and where the two camps are heading.

The last part is a write up by Randy Berry of ESCA
Marketing on the ESCA outlook.

I've not edited Randy's comments so you can see what are
some of our biases are though ESCA addresses BOTH models
in our RTO/ISO systems.  Bear in mind these are simply one
of our staff members comments, but they at least elucidate
some difficult concepts in a reasonable way.

This seemed like something some of you might want as
background, if it's superfluous to your job, please
delete.  dsg

FYI, Jim asked that I drop you a note with regard to a proposed LNG project 
being developed by Global Markets.  I have provided some technical support 
with respect to some onshore storage tariff issues.  

The project consists of converting an oil tanker into a floating vaporization 
facility, anchoring it off the coast of California and constructing a subsea 
pipeline to bring the gas onshore.  The facility would have a daily unloading 
rate of 500,000 mmbtu/d, taking approximately 6-7 days to fully unload a 
cargo.  Approximately 172,000 mmbtu/d would go directly to market, with the 
remainder being injected into utility storage facilities for ultimate 
withdrawal prior to arrival of a new shipment of LNG (roughly 11 days).  The 
goal is to baseload a market of 172,000 mmbtu/d.

The project would have a start-up date in early 2003.  While other proposals 
are being considered to bring LNG into California, the Enron proposal is 
unique in that it is considering onshore gas storage vs offshore LNG 
storage.  Retrofitting the oil tanker takes approximately 18 months.  
Constructing an offshore LNG storage facility would take 3 years -  providing 
Enron a competitive advantage with respect to timing.   To protect this 
competitive advantage during the development stage of the project, it has 
been requested that this particular aspect  be kept confidential.

Lisa Yoho is working directly with Kurt Lindahl, the project manager.

Rick requested I send notice that budget savings submitted for consideration 
have been approved.  Rick advised that dollars relating to RCR or 
discretionary funds were not considered.

It is my understanding that Rick will be discussing the total cost savings 
and its impact at the next direct reports meeting scheduled for this Thursday.

The policy regarding travel and cell phone use will be distributed to all G/A 
employees later this week.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

		 Subject: Today's Meeting



Aleck,

First, thanks for spending time with us this morning.  I think it was a very
worthwhile meeting.

In your thinking about a scheme to satisfy Harris government political
concerns, please consider that the Premier said on May 1 that he is
insisting that before deregulation four conditions will have to be met over
the next 12 months. These are: a guarantee that consumers will be spared
from sharp rate hikes; a reliable supply of power; adequate environmental
safeguards; and continued support for alternative power sources.

I think we need, therefore, to consider how to freeing up the wholesale
market would not cross these four conditions.  For example, deregulating the
wholesale market would not appear to have any negative impact on
environmental safeguards or continued support for alternative power sources.
It may be that such a deregulation would have a positive impact (I noted in
today's WSJ that ENRON and 4 other companies are calling for CO2 caps).  How
could deregulating the wholesale market "guarantee the consumers will be
spared from sharp rate hikes" and "provide a reliable supply of power"?

I think that any plan for reducing market risk that ENRON could suggest (as
you mentioned, Ontario could contract for future deliveries at a set price)
would seem to meet that requirement.  What needs to be clear is the
mechanism whereby this would be done.

If an alternative plan is then contrasted with the consequences of ENRON
pulling out of the Ontario market and the reciprocity repercussions for OPG
in NY, perhaps the Harris government would have the political cover as well
as the incentive to qualify its May 1 statement to include a November 2001
opening for the wholesale market.

best, Mitch

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy 
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and 
approved an amended version of H.R. 1647, Chairman Barton's emergency 
legislation to aid California, by a 17-13 party line vote.  The full Energy 
and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably 
Thursday, May 17th).

The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose 
wholesale price caps for 18 months.  The amendment was defeated 12-20 with 
all Republicans voting against, including the three from California and Rep. 
Greg Walden (R-OR), who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price 
cap amendment, was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the 
amendment.  Also voting "NO" were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and 
Chris John (D-TX), with which we had met in recent days.  The final vote 
tracked our whip count going into the meeting.

Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the 
"negawatts" provision.  There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept 
made sense, there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing, 
including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their 
normal power levels.  Another member said that electric coops that are 
required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that 
power and make a lot of money.  Several Members said businesses could shut 
down, put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more 
money.  Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts.  While the 
amendment to strike was deleted, we will need to respond to these criticisms 
and shore this up before full committee next week.  There will be another 
attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an 
amended version.

Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to 
reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market, thus 
reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order.  This woudl last for 18 months.  
Chairman  Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with 
what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California, but he disagrees 
with the proposed remedy.  He pledged to work with Boucher before Full 
Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should 
analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of 
new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot 
market transactions, or at least what he would define as excessive use of the 
spot market, and at the same time encourage "deep bilateral mechanisms."  The 
mechanisms included a "market balance test" that would say only sellers with 
a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at 
unregulated rates and "spot market circuit breakers" that would be triggered 
when reserves are low in a given market.  Chairman Barton said he likes the 
concept of a spot market circuit breaker, but felt that the amendment was too 
complicated to be evaluated today.  We will also pursue an analysis of this 
amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form.

Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a "net metering" proposal that would 
establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who 
would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto 
the system.  It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke 
favorably of net metering even though they are complementary.

The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the 
section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western 
governors approved it.  The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting 
the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those 
states did not want to upset the work already under way.

A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn, 
none of which relate to our activities.

Colleagues:

Here is the grid that I have sent to Kay Joslin for inclusion in the
registration brochure.  The track leaders deserve a round of applause and
many kudos for the great work they've done in developing a very strong grid.

And, thanks to Kay for doing the vital job of handling all the printing!!!!

Rick

I understand from Ann that you are looking put some subscriptions in place 
for European publications to help you  keep abreast of what's going on over 
here.  I'm preparing a full list of all the English-speaking trade journals 
for your perusal, but in the meantime I thought I'd make a few suggestion of 
how we can help you with this task.

1.  In my view, some of the most accurate and insightful coverage comes from 
the FT Energy special publications unit.  They cover the whole of Europe 
through a number of different titles.  Enron Europe has an online group 
subscription to this series so I am arranging for you to receive a password 
so you can access this site.  Most of the publications come out twice a month.

2.  My group is responsible for media monitoring in Europe.   The material 
comes from a variety of sources and it is quite a challenge to process and 
distribute it effectively.   I suggest that we put you on the distribution 
list for all material that either specifically mentions Enron or that relates 
to regulatory matters in Europe.  

3.  We have a number of different PR companies working for us in our markets 
around Europe and they generally provide media monitoring as well but this is 
not normally translated into English unless there is something significant.  
I suggest that we include you in the circulation for those pieces.

 We also cover Japan, Australia and the Middle East from here.

Japan.   I guess Nick O'Day will send material to you direct.  We have a 
daily translation service of headlines and significant longer pieces from our 
PR agency in Tokyo.
Australia.  I will send you what we get, but things are fairly quiet there at 
present.  I know that Mark Schroeder was in dialogue with Paul Quilkey about 
the status of Government Affairs but I don't believe the issue was resolved.  
I would like to talk to you separately about this issue at some point, if you 
have a minute.
Middle East.  I am still trying to get on the circulation list for media 
coverage as we effect the transition from John Ambler's group.  I plan to 
talk to John about this when he surfaces from handling DPC issues next week.  
In my experience, the key publication for this area is MEED - the Middle East 
Energy Digest.

4.   I will send you a full list of English-speaking trades and highlight the 
ones which I think you will find most useful.   I believe quite a few of them 
are now available online.

Please let me know if I can help with anything else and perhaps we can get 
together for lunch on your next visit.

Jackie

Hi Lisa:

Nice talking to you. Attached is the list of country that we expect to 
generate deals from:

China
Hong Kong
Taiwan
Indonesia
India
Pakistan
Bangladesh
Sri Lanka
Japan
Korea
Australia
New Zealand
Vietnam
Philippines
Thailand

newsprint to and from these countries. Hope it helps in streamlining the deal 
approval process before the transaction volume picks up.

Attached is a letter Marathon drafted to send to the top 100+ CA businesses 
in our database giving them info on our "comprehensive solution."  Rather 
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified 
version, plus an overview page that answers "What does this do for: 
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?"  

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to 
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them 
to be signatories on a formal proposal?

Please let me know what you think. 

Thanks.

Hi Karen:

It was good to see you Friday.  I hope you had a nice visit in So. Cal.

I've attached a draft letter to existing list of CEO's from Ken Lay for your
review.  The attached draft letter assumes that the background material from
Jeff will be enclosed and that the sample letter to Gov. Davis, et. al. asks
for support of specific legislation, policies.

If we've got this wrong, let us know and we will try again.

Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a 
solution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit 
(515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that 
time.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 
500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the 
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something 
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, 
following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term 
sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap 
structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September 
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall 
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and 
the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce 
a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the 
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a 
position that one LDC  could halt market opening. 

Regards
Rob

Rick - 

attached are the proposed budget savings from the Washington office; the 
Washington office proposes to move NERC (Richard Ingersoll and Charles Yueng) 
costs for travel to Jim Steffes' budget; I talked to Jim about this yesterday 
and he is ok with moving the costs to his budget; Jim indicated that he wants 
to have his headcount increased by 2 and the budget dollars moved to his cost 
center to reflect this change; the Washington office indicates that the total 
NERC "Savings" equals $112,000; including the NERC number the Washington 
office proposes a net savings of $240,032; the actual net savings should be 
$128,032 ($240,032 less $112,000); with your permission I will work with 
accounting to move the NERC costs to Jim's cost center and increase his 
headcount appropriately; please advise of any questions, comments or concerns

Eric

I continued meeting with USG officials on 201.  Today I met with Faryar 
Shirzad, Dept. of Commerce Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
Faryar is a friend from his days in the Senate.  

Faryar again said that the interagency working group is philosophically 
opposed to a 201 as a simple political solution and they are looking for 
alternative approaches.  However, he noted that the industry is in crisis 
(not from imports alone) and they want to seek long-term solution.  It was my 
sense that, unlike Competitive Analysis memo, the Administration is no longer 
relying on a 201 to secure support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).  
Faryar reported that a 201 decision is several weeks away, but will made by 
early summer.  The steel industry continues to push the Administration, 
because they believe an Administration initiation carries more weight and 
will more likely result in quotas.

The Senate Finance Committee Chair has said that July is "trade" month for 
his committee, so the Administration may want to announce their intentions 
before then.  The Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley (R-IA)said that 
he was "reluctant" to vote on 201 in his Committee and said the steel 
industry should work with the Administration or file its own private 
action.   This has not stopped Sen. John Rockefeller (D-WV) from encouraging 
Finance Committee action.

The Administration could potentially initiate a 201 investigation and if harm 
is found they can seek quotas or other alternative.  As noted above the 
Administration is looking to the alternative, one is that the industry would 
be forced to restructure (this is the gamble that steel is willing to take).  
To that end, here are two action items:

1)  The Administration is looking a long-term structural change to the US 
domestic steel industry and they asked for consuming industry ideas on legacy 
cost, market restructuring (i.e. efficiency), and global competitiveness.  If 
the steel group has any ideas that we could turn into a document for 
Administration use it would allow us to offer solutions and encourage other 
alternative courses of action. 
2) After we review possible solutions we can offer,  Ken, Jeff, or Steve 
should make the calls to senior Administration officials (within the next two 
weeks). 

I will continue to monitor Administration and Congressional action.

HEALTH
Senate Transition Could Rekindle Generic Drug Reform Effort
   While drug patent reform legislation has been on the shelf for
the past few years, the changing political dynamics in the
Senate--coupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug
costs--may soon mean a renewed effort on the issue. The House
Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the 1984
drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug
bill it is drafting, several key sources said.
   The idea would be to save the government money by removing
some barriers faced by generic copies of brand-name drugs when
they are ready to go to market, sources said.
   But any changes to the Hatch-Waxman law--named for its
sponsors, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-
Calif.--could open up a multitude of other drug patent issues
that have bogged down reform for years.
   "That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between
one [bill] or the other," said a prescription drug industry
source. The brand-name drug industry so far has  been reluctant
to back efforts to change the Hatch-Waxman law. But the generic-
drug industry said it would welcome the change.
   "If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings
that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring
drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit, it makes
great sense" to enact a generic drug bill, said a lobbyist for
the generic drug industry.
   Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by
Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and by
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, could
save as much as $70 billion, sponsors estimate. CBO has yet to
score them.
   But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate,
particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug
companies say they could be forced to make.
   The research-based pharmaceutical industry estimates that it
will spend about $30.5 billion on research and development this
year, compared with $2 billion in 1980. The industry says it
develops about 45 percent of the world's drugs in the United
States.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next
Wednesday on generic drugs, nonprescription drugs, and other
issues. But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much
into the scheduling of the hearing.
   "In noticing the hearing, no one should try to read between
the lines," the spokesman said. "Right now, we're looking at a
wide range of options. In the end, our goal is to address the
issue of escalating prices without harming research and
innovation."
   Hatch-Waxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to
Democratic control in the Senate.
   While aides said no official discussions have taken place on
moving a generic-drug bill since this week's Democratic takeover,
members of at least three panels--the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee, the Commerce Committee and the
Judiciary Committee--have expressed interest.
   And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman.
   "To those who would propose to change the 1984 legislation, I
would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill
and caution against making changes that tilt the balance," Hatch
told a May 25 hearing. "Yet, no law is so perfect that it cannot
stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a
changing marketplace and society."
   Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill
earlier this year that would require generic-drug companies that
enter deals with brand-name companies to keep their products off
the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the
Justice Department.
   Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year, a
spokesman said. -- By April Fulton

ENERGY
Armey, Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy
   After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican
energy policy, House Majority Leader Armey and Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma--both of whom
represent oil-rich states--clashed publicly this week on what
action Congress should take to address the rising costs and
diminishing supplies of the nation's energy.
   Responsible for House communications strategy, Watts called on
House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman
Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the "volatile prices"
facing energy consumers this year.
   "We need to get answers from energy company executives
including producers, suppliers, refiners, transporters,
distributors and retailers, with the goals of finding solutions
to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the
public," Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen.
   Responding to a reporter's question Tuesday, Armey said he
opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of "price
gouging" by the energy industry.
   "I would not personally see the need," Armey said. "Why would
one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political
demagoguery? And that is what it is."
   Armey added: "If people want to look at the companies, point
their fingers at them, that's just nonsense. I don't care who it
comes from. It is just nonsense."
   Without specifically recommending hearings, Watts again urged
Republican members Wednesday "to provide the American people with
answers about the current energy crunch," saying he favored the
measures proposed under President Bush's energy plan.
   "While Democrats overstate the role government should play in
energy policy, Republicans cannot forget that it does have a
role," Watts wrote in his latest memo. "While price caps are not
an option, we must insist on price accountability."
   The Watts memo, based on New Models polling data produced by
Republican pollster David Winston, reflects GOP concerns about
the Democratic energy assault.
   Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the
party switch of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., instead of the
Republican $1.35 trillion tax cut.
   "It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education
when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on
Jeffords," a Watts aide said.
   To keep the GOP tax relief message alive, Watts suggested in
his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the
Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer.
   "From public service announcements to franked mailings, the
possibilities are endless, and Conference is developing a number
of resources for you to use," Watts wrote.
   In his memo, Watts also urged members to "redouble" their
efforts to talk about the passage of education reform. "There is
no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education
just because the vote was gaveled," he wrote.
   An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between
Armey and Watts. "It's just a question of exploring options," the
spokesman said. -- By Mark Wegner

APPROPRIATIONS
Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps, Kills School Lunch Program
   In the first test of FY02 appropriations spending limits,
House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans
defeated a $300 million proposal Wednesday to continue the
international school lunch food-aid program.
   After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young
and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, not to break
the caps, the subcommittee voted 8-7 against the amendment
sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, to
the FY02 Agriculture appropriations bill.
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., voted with the Democrats in favor
of the proposal.
   Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican
subcommittee members nervous. Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., quickly
proposed report language that the subcommittee "strongly urges"
the Agriculture Department to continue the program, formally
known as the Global Food for Education Initiative.
   Former Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., now U.S. ambassador to
the world food agencies in Rome, and former Senate Majority
Leader Dole have promoted it.
   Kaptur asked Walsh to change the "strongly urges" wording to
"expects," and the report language passed unanimously. However,
after the markup session, Kaptur said that she does not know what
impact the report language will have.  She is "inclined" to re-
offer the amendment in full committee.
   Bonilla initially suggested the report language, but House
Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., pressed for the
vote, saying that if the subcommittee "can't get together on food
aid to kids who need it," he did not know what measures it could
agree on.
   The Clinton administration started the international school
lunch initiative, using its administrative authority to
distribute surplus commodities. It did not have to be scored in
FY01, subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained.
   Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush
administration has not stated a clear position on the school
lunch initiative yet.  They believe a directive from the
subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment
for next year.
   The subcommittee later approved the bill, which provides $74.2
billion for all programs, of which $15.5 billion is discretionary
funding. The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs.
   Excluding $3.6 billion in emergency appropriations in the FY01
bill, it contains a 7 percent increase. Kaptur, who has had testy
relations with Bonilla, said the bill was "better than we
expected." -- By Jerry Hagstrom

APPROPRIATIONS
Dem Appropriators Criticize Administration's NSF Funding Request
   A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the
administration's request for funding for the National Science
Foundation, saying it was inadequate to fully support the
agency's research efforts and failed to move toward the panel's
goal of doubling NSF funding over five years, National Journal's
Technology Daily reported.
   "I am disappointed in the administration's overall research
and development budget, and the NSF proposal in particular," said
Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. "This is the first time in the NSF's 50-year
history that an administration has requested Congress to cut
NSF's research budget below the previous year's level."
   The administration requested $4.47 billion for NSF in FY02, a
$56 million increase, or 1.3 percent, which is less than the rate
of inflation. NSF's budget would have to rise by about $600
million in FY02 to meet the goal of doubling in five years,
Mikulski said. She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell, "Is this [$56
million increase] what you wanted, or is this what you got?"
   Colwell defended the budget request, saying it focuses on
areas the administration has identified as priorities, such as
education and training. But she also added that she fully
supports the panel's efforts to double NSF's budget.
   The NSF proposal calls for an 11 percent increase for
education and human resources, including $200 million for math
and science partnerships and $26.2 million for a program that
puts graduate students in K-12 classrooms. The proposal also
would increase stipends for graduate fellowships.
   "We are losing our best and brightest science students to
other fields," said Eamon Kelly, chairman of the National Science
Board, who expressed support for the budget proposal. "Even our
future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific
endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform
their tasks."
   Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of
science and math education and worker literacy.
   But she also noted the value of funding basic research in
science and technology, saying that if NSF had not done the work
it began 50 years ago, "I don't believe we'd have the information
technology we have today."
   Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSF's
support for nanoscale science and engineering research by 16.1
percent. "Nanotechnology ... could change the way almost
everything is designed, from medicines to computers to
automobiles."
   The budget request would increase funding for research and
related areas by 0.5 percent, to $3.33 billion. Members of the
House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon
characterized that funding level as inadequate.
   "About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request
is that it's disappointing," said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-
Texas.
   Testifying at the House hearing, NSF Deputy Director Joseph
Bordogna said the budget's focus on "people" was intentional.
   "NSF is as much about building a world-class workforce as it
is about discovery," he said. "It is important to emphasize that
research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that
synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is
fundamental to NSF's mission." -- By Robert Lamb

APPROPRIATIONS
Despite Shrunken Surplus, GOP Sees Increased FY02 Cushion
   Despite CBO's reduced estimate of next year's surplus,
Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY02 budget
cushion of about $27.5 billion--even after setting aside the
politically untouchable Medicare trust-fund surplus.
   GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller-
than-allowed costs of the FY02 share of the $1.35 trillion tax
cut. The experts explained their estimates of the figures in
response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the
FY02 cushion may have sagged to as low as $1 billion, based on
CBO's revised surplus estimates.
   Democrats, meanwhile, countered that the tax cut, which
President Bush plans to sign today, relies on an accounting
gimmick in FY02 to make additional money available. In FY03 and
beyond, this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trust-fund
surplus--despite language in the budget resolution that bars
Congress from doing so.
   In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt,
D-S.C., planned to release today, Democrats charge that the $1.35
trillion tax cut "exhausts the available surplus in 2003 through
2006 and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare," even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits
in the budget resolution.
   The FY02 budget resolution approved by Congress used CBO's
January baseline to project a total FY02 budget surplus of $218.6
billion, with an on-budget surplus of $47.7 billion, of which
$35.9 billion comes from the Medicare Part A trust-fund surplus.
   The remaining $11.8 billion of the surplus was left as a
reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget,
including the increase in defense spending expected to result
from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's strategic review.
   Last week, CBO released its analysis of the president's
budget, using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the
surplus by $9 billion. In April, CBO recalculated the FY02
Medicare trust fund at $37.6 billion--or $1.7 billion larger than
estimated in January.
   Taken together, CBO's most recent estimates of the total
surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of
the FY02 reserve by $10.7 billion, leaving only $1.1 billion in
the reserve.
   The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by $65.3
billion in FY02. But the final tax package that Congress enacted,
as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, carries an FY02
price tag of just $37.8 billion--meaning that $27.5 billion
budgeted for, but not "spent," in the tax bill should be included
in the available FY02 surplus.
   CBO's January baseline produced a reserve of nearly $12
billion for FY02, assuming the tax bill would use up the entire
$65.3 billion provided in the budget. Because the tax bill
actually cost $27.5 billion less, the reserve instead would
amount to about $39 billion, using the January surplus estimates.
   Using the less generous May baseline and the more-than-$1
billion reserve it produces, the unspent portion of the tax bill
would take the FY02 reserve to almost $29 billion.
   In both cases, the reserve represents the size of the surplus
after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set
aside.
   In the analysis being issued today, Democrats say the size of
the tax cut "means that funding priorities like defense
modernization, a Medicare prescription drug benefit or
education--priorities that even Republicans support--will require
a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes: Either the
resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social
Security and Medicare, or funding of other national priorities
must be severely cut--simply because the tax cut is too big."
   The Democratic analysis uses CBO's May baseline and includes
the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the
budget resolution, adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the
enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   It projects an available surplus, outside the Social Security
and Medicare trust funds, of $24 billion in FY02 (a figure that
accounts for $5 billion in debt service costs)--but a deficit of
$5 billion in FY03 and a $2 billion deficit in FY04.
   As for the FY02 surplus, Democrats counter that Republicans
were only able to show a surplus by using a $33 billion
accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY01 to FY02.
   As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with
the budget resolution, a provision delays the deadline for
corporate estimated-tax payments from September 15 to October 1,
2001--effectively making the $33 billion in estimated revenue
available on the first day of FY02, instead of at the end of
FY01. -- By Lisa Caruso

TRADE
Anti-NAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort
   Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be
facing this year is the establishment of a free-trade agreement
with Chile. A group of labor and environmental organizations
known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans
today to step up lobbying against the deal.
   The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters and Friends of the Earth, along with a number of labor
groups from Chile.
   The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with
Chile worked out by the end of the year. It is expected that such
an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which many labor, environmental and human rights
groups charge has adversely affected U.S. jobs and environmental
standards in the business corridor along the U.S.-Mexican border.
   Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade
with Chile are Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Phil Gramm, R-
Texas. Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA.
   Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed
trade deal, sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the
bitter NAFTA controversy.
   While significant differences remain between the United States
and Chile over the details of the deal, the administration has
stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a
Free Trade Area of Americas, and the Chilean pact would help
advance that effort.
   In addition, such a pact would help Chile play a higher-
profile role in South American political and economic affairs
than its rival, Brazil.
   To help bring about the FTAA, many observers believe it is
essential for the president to have broad presidential trade-
negotiating authority. Formerly known as fast track, the proposal
is moving up on the congressional agenda.
   House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to
see a measure on the floor as soon as July, and Senate Finance
Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential
trade-negotiating authority. But Baucus has insisted that labor
and environmental matters be taken into account.
   This week, the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to
Congress members.  It outlines a spate of bilateral trade
agreements in recent years--often without U.S. participation and
at the expense of the United States.
   To shore up the U.S. role in trade matters, the Business
Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration
calls "trade promotion authority" as quickly as possible. -- By

TECHNOLOGY
High-Tech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate
   With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring
speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a
higher priority in the chamber, members of the Silicon Valley
lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the
issue, National Journal's Technology Daily reported.
   In a conference call earlier this week, lobbyists for high-
tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Sun
Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy
principles, without advocating or opposing any particular
legislation. The list then could be used to educate senators on
how to view any particular privacy bill. "Companies are still
trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of
legislation or not," said one person familiar with the TechNet
call.
   The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings, who
sponsored a tough privacy bill in the 106th Congress, fueled
speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups
that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved.
   Expectations for action in 2001 had dimmed over the past six
months, as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent
and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill.
   But several high-tech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed
personal interest in protecting consumers' privacy and could
become more aggressive on the issue.
   Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher
priorities, such as transportation and television violence.
   A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling
his priorities. Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., have re-introduced the privacy bills they
sponsored in the 106th Congress.
   TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the
organization's members are working on opening a dialogue with
Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee
is expected to consider. She also said TechNet had been planning
to develop privacy principles.
   Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be
developing the group's privacy principles. She also would not
comment on what direction the group might pursue.
   The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to
take on privacy, with some companies and associations taking a
stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others
advocating a free-market approach to determining a solution to
privacy protection.
   Meanwhile, the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains
uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an
agreement on committee assignments.
   Hollings is officially the chairman, but any freshman members,
such as Sen. George Allen, R-Va., currently have no seats on
Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is
based on the organizational structure adopted for the 106th
Congress. -- By Bara Vaida

AGRICULTURE
Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs
   Representatives of agricultural conservation, wildlife and
industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the
conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday, when they
testified before the House Agriculture Conservation, Credit,
Rural Development and Research Subcommittee.
   Craig Cox, executive vice president of the Soil and Water
Conservation Society, called for doubling the Agriculture
Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting
a new $3 billion "stewardship-based farm and ranch program" to
pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation
practices.
   If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued, Cox said,
farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship
contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm
program.
   Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in
production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program.
The increased spending would require a "dramatically expanded"
Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide
technical services, he said.
   A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze
the stewardship "contracts" farmers would have to take out with
the government to get the money, Cox said.
   Cox said the society's proposal, based on two years of
interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in
agriculture, would be available to farmers throughout the
country, unlike the current commodity programs, which concentrate
assistance in the Plains and the South.
   The proposal envisions large-scale assistance to ranchers with
grazing land and to growers of specialty crops.
   Asked his views on limits to conservation payments, Cox said
he believes the money should go those who deliver "environmental
goods and services" to the taxpayer.
   The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
testified in favor of block grants to state governments to
develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state. Wildlife
groups asked for an expansion of the land-idling Conservation
Reserve Program to 45 million acres.
   But the National Grain and Feed Association, which represents
agricultural suppliers, said the CRP should not be expanded
beyond the current 36.4 million acres.
   After the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla.,
said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be
costly.
   "The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority
of groups asked for in the commodity title, plus what most groups
have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title,
we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the
entire farm bill," Lucas said. "That is why I want to focus on
what is working and what is not working; what is being done
efficiently and effectively and what is not." -- By Jerry

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Dorgan: Democrats Will Rule Senate With A `Different Tone'
   Democrats will seek to promote a "different tone and a
different style" as the majority party, although the new
political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda
and relationships that shape the Capitol, according to Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
   "The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to
what we have to do in the next few weeks," Dorgan, who co-chairs
the Democratic Policy Committee, said Wednesday during a wide-
ranging interview with CongressDaily.
   Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation, the
Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY02
appropriations bills.
   On energy issues, a top Bush administration priority, Dorgan
said the president's plan "is not a balanced plan." He said the
Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that
is "much more significant than any of us thought."
   Dorgan, who met with newly installed Energy and Natural
Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday, said Democratic
legislation would focus on production, conservation, renewable
energy, and efficiency of appliances. Emphasizing an area of
agreement with the White House, he said there were opportunities
to join on incentives to encourage production.
   "My hope is we don't debate the production issue over ANWR,"
he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge.
   He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to
encourage conservation--but did not say how they would offset
costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include. Democrats
and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of
the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut.
   But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit
the $1.35 trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today.
   "The budget is passed. The tax cut is passed. That largely
settled those fiscal policy issues for the year." Dorgan said.
   Dorgan, who will chair the Senate Treasury-Postal
Appropriations Subcommittee, predicted little change at the
Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show.
   Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee
ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., Dorgan noted
that "most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way," and
anticipated little change in the panel's spending priorities
under his chairmanship.
   The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year,
when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the
same time they are trying to move the two largest spending
bills--Defense and Labor-HHS.
   With little room to maneuver, Congress might again be forced
to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from
busting the budget, or round up the 60 votes needed in the Senate
to raise the caps.
   The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly $7
billion FY01 supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week.
   With only $500 million in offsets, the supplemental uses up
nearly the entire $6.5 billion by which Congress raised the FY01
in the budget resolution. Any more spending added to the
supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an
emergency.
   But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet--
cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use
emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend
beyond the 4 percent increase for FY02 the administration has
called for. Otherwise, be prepared for presidential vetoes,
Daniels warned this week.
   In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other
appropriators, Dorgan said: "Mitch Daniels is sounding his
political horn these days. I would sooner he just get down to
business and work with us, and back off the politics just a
little bit."
   Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how
the year would unfold, although he reflected on several new
trends.
   "[Majority Leader] Daschle will play a much more pivotal role
in national politics now than he did as minority leader," he
said.
   Dorgan said Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' switch to independent
status is "not likely to be repeated in this Congress" by other
senators. A close confidant of the new leader, Dorgan praised
Daschle for his decentralized leadership style.
   "He brings people in. He meets ... He has the patience of
Job," declared Dorgan.
   Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair
will switch from playing occasional "defense" to developing more
of an issues agenda.
   Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic
amendments when Republicans were in the majority.
   "Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having
absolute control on the floor of issues," he said, adding that
Democratic leaders have discussed how they will operate
differently.
   "I suspect you will see legislation coming to the floor of the
Senate without the restrictions Senator Lott imposed." Dorgan
said.
   Dorgan acknowledged that Democrats had to try to accommodate
Republicans because they hold such a narrow majority.
   "There's certainly a danger of high expectations," he said.
"Nothing much has changed, except the majority leader and the
committee chairs. The Republicans learned and we understand that
it's not easy to get things done in a Senate that's evenly
split." -- By Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Organizing Talks Continue; Daschle Asks Monday-Friday Schedule
   A team of five Republican senators met for a second time
Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Daschle to negotiate a new
organizing resolution to reflect Democratic control of the
Senate--and for the second straight day the two sides described
"productive" and "cordial" talks but reported no final agreement.
   "We had a good meeting and that's all I can say," Daschle said
late Wednesday.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the negotiating team had
another "good, productive meeting" with Daschle, adding: "I
believe we're making progress. Everybody wants to solve this
thing...I think we pretty well have done what we want to do."
   Moderate GOP Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he
believed "some reality has set in" among his Republican
colleagues, many of whom were urging a hard line in the
negotiations earlier this week.
   "There were a lot less aggressive tones today [in a meeting of
the GOP Conference] than even back in January," when the power-
sharing agreement was negotiated for a 50-50 Senate. "[And] it
was a much more logical conversation" than earlier in the week,
he said. "There wasn't much of a moderate/conservative split in
there."
   One change will soon become evident in the Senate. Daschle
said the chamber would begin working on a Monday-through-Friday
schedule.
   Throughout the day Wednesday, Republicans continued to raise
the issue of judicial and other nominees, although the demand for
written assurances that such nominations would receive a floor
vote seemed to recede as the day progressed.
   Still, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said there was "broad
concern within the [GOP] Conference that members of the new
majority have made statements that would change the precedent on
nominees."
   Santorum said he had "never called for a rules change" to
address the issue, but said he was concerned by comments he
attributed to Judiciary Chairman Leahy that nominees can be
disqualified simply because they are conservatives.
   "We need to confirm with the Democratic side that there will
be no break with precedent," he said.
   But Santorum agreed that the operating resolution should be
resolved within "another day or so."
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a senior member of the Judiciary
Committee, was dismissive of the idea that Bush administration
nominees should receive any special consideration.
   "Bill Lan Lee is my answer to that," he said, in reference to
a Clinton administration Justice Department nomination that
Republicans refused to bring forward for a vote. "We will hear
from the Justice Department [on judicial nominees] and we will
have full and fair hearings. But there is no presumption to be on
the Supreme Court."
   GOP Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho, said one
of the options Republicans were discussing was dealing with their
concerns about nominations "for the record," either through a
"dialogue" on the Senate floor or through some other type of
understanding. He predicted that negotiations could be completed
today, although he said his guess was it would not be voted on
until next week.
   "The option is to take the appropriate time," Craig said.
   Craig agreed with statements by Daschle that the two parties
might try to reach an understanding that if Republicans were to
regain control, the now defunct 50-50 power sharing resolution
would again take effect.
   "That's probably fairly close," said Craig, who also seemed to
indicate that Democrats had reacted favorably to some GOP
suggestions. "We've asked for several things that they think are
fair that we think are fair."
   But he also acknowledged that as the minority party,
Republicans had limited tools at their disposal. "We cannot scalp
Pat Leahy," he said of the Judiciary Committee chairman. -- By

Morella Declines Governor Bid; Focus Shifts To Ehrlich
   Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., disclosed Tuesday that she
would not run for governor in 2002--while all but saying that she
will seek re-election to a ninth term, the Baltimore Sun
reported.
   "My concentration has always been in my district, I like where
I am," said Morella, who was first elected in 1986 to her
Montgomery County-based seat.
   The decision turns the statewide spotlight on GOP Rep. Robert
Ehrlich, who plans to make an announcement this summer on whether
he will seek the governor's office.
   But pollster Keith Haller said Morella's announcement is a big
setback for the Maryland Republican Party--because polls showed
her to be a formidable statewide candidate, and because Democrats
would have a hard time as portraying the politically moderate
Morella as out of the mainstream. Ehrlich as regarded as more
conservative.
   But Haller added, "Ehrlich now has a wide-open opportunity to
assume the Republican mantle should he believe it's politically
feasible."
   The leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination is Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the
late Sen. Robert Kennedy, D-N.Y.
   Even though she has taken herself out of contention for
governor, Morella may still face a member of the Kennedy dynasty
next year: state Del. Mark Shriver, son of Special Olympics
founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, has announced he will seek
Morella's House seat.

Davis Appeals To GOP Lawmakers For Donations To Forbes
   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia appealed to GOP House members Wednesday for donations
to the congressional bid of state Sen. Randy Forbes in a
forthcoming Virginia special election.
   Davis noted that 71 GOP members have already contributed to
the Forbes campaign, and urged the remaining 150 GOP Conference
members to pony up as well.
   Forbes is running against Democratic state Sen. Louise Lucas
in the June 19 special election for the 4th District seat of the
late Democratic Rep. Norman Sisisky. The politically marginal
district stretches across southern Virginia from the Richmond
area to Portsmouth.
   A NRCC spokesman confirmed the Davis request, saying, "It's a
close race, and we need all the help we can get."
   House Majority Whip DeLay Wednesday also briefed the GOP
Conference of his ROMP and STOMP programs.
   ROMP--the Retain Our Majority Program--encourages safe
incumbents to contribute excess campaign contributions to
vulnerable GOP members.
   STOMP--the Strategic Task Force for Organizing and Mobilizing
People--is designed to build a grassroots response to such
traditional Democratic allies as organized labor and
environmental activists.

In Mich., GOP Keeps Searching For Levin Foe
   Having already been turned down by a number of potential
candidates, Michigan Republicans are continuing their search for
a 2002 candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Carl Levin--who
Wednesday assumed the chairmanship of the Armed Services
Committee with the Senate's shift to Democratic control.
   Businessman Jim Nicholson, who lost a 1996 bid for the GOP
nomination against Levin, told The Detroit News that "it will
take brave people" to consider going against Levin, while adding,
"And I may be one of them." Nicholson said he would not decide
until late this year.
   Another possible Levin challenger getting high marks from the
state GOP headquarters is businessman David Brandon, a close ally
of GOP Gov. John Engler who is a University of Michigan trustee.
A party spokesman said Brandon is "a guy with a good story who
would be a good candidate."
   Another close Engler associate--Dan Pero, a former Engler
chief of staff who managed two of the governor's campaigns--last
month took himself out of the running.

Backus Moving From DNC To DCCC
   Jenny Backus says she decided to leave her post as spokeswoman
for the Democratic National Committee to move to the Democratic

opportunity to work directly on House races, which are
essential."
   DCCC Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York has tapped the veteran

   Backus said she will miss working with DNC Chairman Terry
McAuliffe, but added that she wanted more contact with "up and

COLUMN: ON THE MONEY
A Train Wreck Wrecker?
   When you ask most people how this year's appropriations season
will go, they let out a groan reminiscent of Lurch on "The Addams
Family." But not Mitch Daniels. The OMB director still thinks
everything may turn out OK--although he is a little less
optimistic now that the Democrats have taken over the Senate.
   "We're very serious about this being an orderly process,"
Daniels said in an interview this week. Asked if the process can
be smooth, Daniels said, "We'll find out." But he also said, "I'm
confident we were on our way to that and I'm confident we can
still do it." He conceded that working with Democrats leading the
Senate may be different from working with the Republicans, but
said, "We'll have to be flexible where we can be."
   For the past few years of the Clinton administration, then-OMB
Director Lew started the season with a speech in which he
projected gloom and doom: The budget resolution contained false
numbers....They were too low....Nobody believed that was the
amount the government really would spend....We would end up in a
budget confrontation at the end of the fiscal year, and the
confrontation would drag into November or later....
   Many predict the same endgame this year. They contend
education, defense and other priorities will exceed the budget
resolution, and the spending caps will be increased.
   Daniels is making it clear that that is not acceptable. Rather
than start with a speech, he opened the appropriations season
with an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, in which he
emphasized that the administration wants to stick with this
year's budget resolution.
   In this week's interview, Daniels said he is trying to change
the way OMB interacts with Congress to try to convince members.
Republicans used to complain that OMB only entered the
appropriations process at the end--when the president threatened
a veto and the endgame negotiations had to begin.
   Daniels said OMB is trying to work with Congress at the start
of the process. Asked when his office became involved, he
commented, "Have been, are, will be." OMB officials already have
met with appropriations subcommittee staff and will continue to
do so throughout the process, Daniels said. The new strategy was
a careful calculation, he said. As a former Senate staffer, he
certainly realizes that members carefully protect their
prerogatives. And he kept saying OMB would be only as involved as
appropriators want them to be. But having said that, Daniels
added, "From the beginning, it seemed clear to me that we wanted
to be in body contact with the appropriators all the way, and we
have been."
   However, he is not sure how the appropriations dynamic changes
with changeover in the Senate. "This moves the needle a little
bit, but not far." As Republicans have been fond of pointing out,
the membership of the Senate has not changed.
   But of course, being bipartisan means swallowing hard
sometimes and being willing to compromise--even on pork barrel
projects, a particular target of the administration. President
Bush has made it clear he wants to cut down on earmarked
projects. In the supplemental spending bill sent to Congress this
month, Bush proposed to rescind some $93 million earmarked last
year for I-49 in Arkansas--money put in the Transportation bill
to try to help the unsuccessful re-election campaign of former
appropriator Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark.
   The proposed rescission has been criticized--and clearly is a
sign that Bush is targeting such projects. Even so, Daniels said
the administration realizes it is going to have to be somewhat
pragmatic. "We called a lot of attention to the sixfold explosion
of earmarks, which is a distinctly bipartisan phenomenon,"
Daniels said. But he quickly added: "We do think this trend ought
to be reined in, but we're realistic. To the extent that this is
a lubricant to the process or a bipartisan process, we recognize
that a lot of it will go on."
   Although Democrats have repeatedly criticized this year's
budget process, Daniels believes it worked "fine." But Bush has
proposed a series of budget reforms--ranging from a two-year
budget cycle to an automatic continuing resolution that would go
into effect if Congress did not complete the 13 annual funding
bills by the end of the year.
   Daniels said that reform of the CR process would be a good
place to start. Appropriators have said they believe an automatic
CR takes away all of the incentive to complete the 13 individual
bills. The administration believes just the opposite. "The
president interprets it as a way to move the process to
conclusion to avoid end-of-session chaos," said Daniels.
   And of course, end-of-session chaos is something everyone--
especially the president--would like to avoid. -- By  David

COLUMN: HOUSE RACE HOTLINE
A Very Special Time Of Year
   2001 hardly has been an "off year" in the House, with a total
of six special elections slated--and it's only June. However,
unlike in most presidential inaugural years, just one of the six
special elections resulted from a job offer with the
administration. The remaining special elections resulted from two
resignations--both by members of the president's party--and three
deaths.
   As expected, former state Sen. Diane Watson won Tuesday's
special election in California's heavily Democratic 32nd
District. That race, along with last month's special election in
Pennsylvania's heavily Republican 9th District, set the pattern
for the majority of 2001 special elections.  They hold heavily
competitive primaries--or district conventions--with the eventual
winner cruising to victory in the special general election.
   The exception to that rule is in Virginia's 4th District,
which is known as "the only game in the country." The race to
replace the late Democratic Rep. Norman Sisisky matches two state
senators in a district that President Bush carried by just 500
votes last November.
   While pressure to hold the seat lies with the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the Republicans boast a home-
field advantage, with fellow Virginia Rep. Tom Davis at the helm
of the National Republican Congressional Committee and Gov. James
Gilmore leading the Republican National Committee. Voters will
head to the polls June 19.
   Here is your primer on the remaining primary-to-watch
specials:
   Massachusetts 09: In February, the late Democratic Rep. Joe
Moakley announced he would not run for re-election in 2002 due to
incurable leukemia, so potential candidates had been jockeying
for his seat well before his death on Memorial Day. The current
frontrunner--at least in the media--is Max Kennedy, one of the
younger sons of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, D-N.Y. But the
"frontrunner" title is very tenuous: The Kennedy clan publicly
expressed concern about Max's bid after early missteps.
   Early speculation circulated that Kennedy's chief competitor,
state Sen. Stephen Lynch, would run as an independent, to avoid a
crowded Democratic primary that would give Kennedy an advantage.
Then he would take on Kennedy one-on-one. Some observers believe
that if a Kennedy is beatable, it would be in a special election
primary held this year--not in a regular primary held 15 months
from now. Acting GOP Gov. Jane Swift has yet to announce a
special election.
   Arkansas 03: Originally, the race to replace GOP Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, Bush's appointment to lead the Drug Enforcement
Administration, was set up to be a race between two of Arkansas'
political families--the Hutchinsons and the Huckabees. However,
not one but two of GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee's candidates have
dropped out. Meanwhile, Hutchinson's nephew, former state Rep.
Jim Hendren, dropped out, only to decide the next day that he was
back in.
   When the seat opened up, a member of another political family,
state Sen. Gunner DeLay, said he would defer to Hendren. However,
after Hendren's indecision, House Majority Whip DeLay's cousin
moved ahead with plans to run.
   While this is a solidly Republican seat--then-President
Clinton couldn't even carry his hometown district in 1996--a
number of Democrats are considering bids, because in a special,
you just never know. The date of this special election has not
been set yet, since Hutchinson is not resigning from the seat
until he is confirmed by the Senate.
   Florida 01: After a fake retirement announcement was the
subject of a radio station's April Fool gag, GOP Rep. Joe
Scarborough fooled us all in late May by announcing he would
resign in September. Scarborough took the seat from Democrats in
1994 GOP landslide, and Republicans are heavily favored to hold
this district.  In fact, the chief of staff to former Democratic
Rep. Earl Hutto is running as a Republican.
   To date, things appear to be in a minor mess, as no fewer than
18 candidates are currently looking at the race--including a
father and a son running against each other. GOP Gov. Jeb Bush
has set a special election for October 16, with the primary July
24 and a runoff Sept. 4.
   Meanwhile, in Ohio's 17th District, talk is already swirling
about a potential special election if indicted Democratic Rep.
James Traficant is convicted. The Warren Tribune-Chronicle
speculated that after the case goes to trial next February, the
state "might be able to fit either the primary for the special
election or the special election itself" on May 7--which would
coincide with the regular primary for Congress.
   Add the fact that redistricting would have two different sets
of voters in Ohio's 17th District, and this special election
could be the most special--or at least most interesting--of them
all. -- By Charles Todd and Maureen Hurley Schweers

ENVIRONMENT
Administration Will Address Global Warming, Rice Says
   White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
indicated Wednesday that the administration will advance ideas
about global warming before President Bush leaves for Europe next
week, but she was unclear about whether Bush himself will speak
on the issue, as many expect.
   Rice said Bush would be ready to share "what we've learned
thus far" with the allies during his trip. Rice, who briefed
reporters on the trip agenda, said the Cabinet-level group
mulling the issue has not determined what it will tell the
president before he embarks.
   But she indicated that whatever information it gives Bush, the
group will not issue final recommendations before he meets with
European leaders, who have criticized his decision to scrap the
Kyoto treaty.
   Rice confirmed that Bush believes global warming is taking
place but added that the advisory group--which includes EPA
Administrator Whitman, Energy Secretary Abraham, Treasury
Secretary O'Neill, Interior Secretary Norton and White House
National Economic Council Director Larry Lindsey--is trying to
"understand better what we don't know."
   Rice said the panel is exploring the evidence that
"sequestration"--the removal of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere by plant life--can "play a role in dealing with
emissions,"among other proposals.

POLITICS
Moderate Republicans Help Dems Win First Senate Vote
   Moderate Republicans helped Senate Democrats win their first
vote since Democrats took control of the chamber Wednesday on an
amendment, sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to the
education bill.  It requires states to develop quality, peer-
reviewed tests before receiving grants.
   But Democrats may face a more difficult challenge today.
   Wellstone, along with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is
planning to offer an amendment to prevent states from being
required to comply with President Bush's plan to test every child
in grades 3-8, unless the federal government fully funds Title I.
   Title I provides funds to educate poor and disadvantaged
students, and Democrats have argued that traditionally it has
been underfunded.
   Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy,
who is managing the bill on the floor, will oppose the so-called
"trigger" amendment because it would "undercut the bill," a
spokesman said.
   "Senator Kennedy shares Sen. Wellstone's concern....  However,
efforts to secure additional funding should not set back the
efforts to put into place the quality assessments," said a
spokesman.

TRADE
Bush Orders Permits For Firms To Truck International Cargo
   President Bush ordered Wednesday that U.S. businesses owned by
Mexican citizens be permitted to truck international cargo
between points within the United States.
   The order, in a memorandum to Transportation Secretary Mineta
that will be published in the Federal Register, implements a
portion of a NAFTA arbitration panel decision against U.S.
treatment of Mexican trucking firms. The order does not affect
the right of Mexican trucks to enter the United States, a portion
of the decision that has not yet been implemented.
   Under Wednesday's order, Mexican-owned enterprises also will
be allowed to provide bus service within the United States. Bush
directed the Transportation Department to "expeditiously"
implement the order.

COMMERCE
New Democrat Coalition To Kick-Start `E-Genda'
   Five members of the New Democrat Coalition are scheduled to
kick-start their e-commerce "e-genda" by introducing a House
resolution calling for businesses, government agencies and
Congress members to incorporate the Platform for Privacy
Preferences technology into their Web sites, a technology policy
analyst for the Progressive Policy Institute told National
Journal's Technology Daily.
   Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is expected to introduce a
resolution supported by California Reps. Calvin Dooley and Ellen
Tauscher, as well as Reps. James Moran of Virginia and Rick
Larsen of Washington.
   All five lawmakers also are expected to announce that their
Web sites are compliant with P3P, a technology that its
supporters say will help users preserve their online privacy.
   The new Democrats' "e-genda" will be released later this
month.

ANCILLARY SERVICES - THE NEXT FRONTIER

 Since the issuance of Order Nos. 888-889 by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ("Commission") in 1996, market recognition of the
value of ancillary services provided in this regulatory initiative, has
increased dramatically.  Shortly thereafter, the FERC recognized that
market-based rates could also be provided for certain of these ancillary
services, which include voltage regulation, spinning reserves, non-spinning
reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically
bundled service.  This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a
stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a
competitive marketplace.  With the formation of independent system operators
(ISOs) and the consideration of movement to regional transmission
organizations (RTOs), ancillary services have received increased discussion
and attention.  Frequently, markets do not have yet sufficient market makers
to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain
services.  For example, because of market deficiencies in California and New
York, ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny.

 This short history and limited development of ancillary services is
about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs.  It can
be expected that a revamped Bush-era FERC will finalize most RTO proposals
this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues
on the Commission.  That process should conclude by the end of 2001 with
increased enforcement and market monitoring, new mechanisms to resolve
disputes, increased resolution of seams management concerns, new
transmission pricing and return policies, and major market validation of
for-profit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and
development of transmission in the future.

Key Considerations

 This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given
the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the
regulated utility industry.  Over the past 25 years the utility industry has
whittled away its transmission legacy, with little real growth and
development of the national transmission system to support the advent and
movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since 1988.  Ancillary
services will become a critical element of that market as they become the
future call-waiting, *69, and call-forward services of the electric utility
industry - borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from
the prior decade of experience.  Formation of RTOs will provide stronger
market validation and recognition of ancillary services.  This will
necessitate the development of separate pricing, new forms of contracting,
new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through
separate contracts, and pricing opportunities through formal agreements.  In
many instances, agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service
sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with
the electric utility.  Several areas require current consideration at this
time to ensure a smooth and effective transition:

* Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate
provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating
facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility.
* The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTO's need
further understanding and management for risks, liabilities and cost
consequences.
* Recognition for adequate compensation and market-based pricing for
ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement
that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements.
* Transition of existing transmission and interconnection agreements
to the RTOs should be contemplated in current agreements.  Assignment of
those agreements should only be permitted with appropriate notice and review
rights by the generator, and the opportunity to accept, amend or reject the
terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for
enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of
ancillary services.
* There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been
recognized by Order Nos. 888-889 and they should be analyzed and evaluated.
Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those
future services, including development and pricing opportunities for those
services, should be separately retained in existing agreements now.
Otherwise, the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided
to the regulated utility at no charge.
Future Course of Action
Why has this occurred?  Individual utilities managing the needs of their
systems - with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount
reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the
value of ancillary services.  Bundled service also disguised this value and
did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition.
Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running.
Moreover, utilities operating in a monopoly, cost-of-service regime did not
have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through
creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services.  With the
evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets, a shift will be undertaken
in the provision of ancillary services, such as security, emergency
planning, risk management, and reliability from discrete utility systems to
all potential players in the competitive market, including generators,
regulated utilities, transmitting utilities, power marketers and traders and
large scale industrial and commercial users.  This restructuring of the
market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of
critical ancillary services, their recognition as a matter of contract, and
the appropriate elements of market-based rates and cost of service analysis
(as applicable) and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new,
essential products.

 Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing
this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in
anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of
competitive markets, which will allow them to capture contracting and
pricing opportunities for the benefit of their owners or shareholders.

Background

The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate=
d=20
monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n=
ow=20
have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20
emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=
=20
risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=
=20
proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=
0%=20
tolerance level or 5MW.=20

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=
he=20
availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=
=20
balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=
=20
effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=
=20
blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=
l=20
transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=
=20
of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=
=20
the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20
Resources Limited ("ECTRL") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=
=20
closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=
he=20
very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20

Future Developments

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20
trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=
=20
with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=
=20
over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=
=20
release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=
=20
the further development of the market.

Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=
=20
(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=
=20
balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20
services.
=20
Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=
=20
However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met.=20

Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=
al=20
capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou=
t=20
30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20
contribute to increase liquidity.=20

Regulatory Environment

The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=
y=20
is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20
gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness =
in=20
the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=
=20
certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=
l=20
of liberalisation still exist.=20

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=
an=20
required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=
ss=20
(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20
transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20
current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=
ar=20
and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20
Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=
=20
consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=
r=20
market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20
direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=
nt=20
declined a quicker opening of the power market.

The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=
on=20
de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20
ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=
r=20
non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=
=20
tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=
=20
IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20

RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=
=20
Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20
allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=
=20
levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20
players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20
regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=
d=20
imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=
=20
and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=
=20
is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20
request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =

in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers =
a=20
maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% =
of=20
the installed capacity, including long term contracts. Although the=20
interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M. Tuot,=20
Director General of the CRE, implies that these restrictions only apply to=
=20
French authorised producers and thus not to foreign-based energy companies =
or=20
other non-producing entities. Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=
L,=20
as we are not registered in France.  In addition, French IPPs are free to=
=20
sell and export their production.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a balancing responsibility contract=
=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was published on 13 July 2000 by=20

There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=

Future Developments

over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=

Regulatory Environment
 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>=20
The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=

transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20

Updated May 2001.

1)Background

France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.=
=20
EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th=
e=20
world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20
historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power =
in=20
Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the=
=20
French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20
nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation=
=20
represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.=
=20

A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such=
=20
as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell=
=20
their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan=
t=20
development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20
installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe=
r=20
generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is "preferable" the=20
correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20
Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=
=20
apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.
More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession area.

2) Regulatory Environment

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20
regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=
he=20

=20
Dozens  ["Dozens"  - I would replace this with "Several")  of application=
=20
decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=
=20
The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=
=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20
auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20
clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=
=20
per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20
French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.

Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio=
n=20
of customers located in their concession area. =20
A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three year contractual framework. =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision=

from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.=
=20
Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t=
o=20
eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20
including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio=
ns=20
of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20
restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in=

France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.

to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=
=20
available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=
=20
about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20
eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20
created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20

In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R=

allocation rule is likely to change by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is=20
likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =
=20

The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato=

body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20
eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20
      =20
3) Business Opportunity

Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=

However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,=
=20
imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market=
=20
will develop rapidly.        =20

5) The Gas Market Situation

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is=
=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20=
00=20
by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to=
=20
be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t=
o=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=
re=20
located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.=
=20
The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=
e=20
conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps.
As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20
approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic=
=20
legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and=
=20
the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry.   =20
Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to=20
customers from new entrants, it is already possible to optimise gas supply=

The following key Second Extraordinary Session Assembly bills were just
introduced.  Additional bills were introduced to deal primarily with
items such as outage schedules and notification protocols as well as
consumer tax credits.

ABX2 1 (Cardoza) - This bill would permit irrigation districts to
purchase gas from public agencies and permit irrigation districts to
explore for gas.  This is identical to ABX1 39.

ABX2 2 (Corbett) - This would establish as windfall profits tax.  This
is identical to ABX1 128.

ABX2 7 (Simitian) - This would establish a formula for standby charges
for QFs.  This is identical to ABX1 108.

ABX2 9 (Migden) - This would permit local governments to aggregate
provided that IOUs provide metering and billing services.  This is
identical to ABX1 48.

ABX2 10 (Hertzberg) - This would require, as a condition of receiving a
permit from the CEC, that a generator enter into a contract with DWR or
a municipal utility.  This is identical to ABX1 60.

ABX2 11 (Wright) - This would permit governmental entities currently
served by SCE and LADWP to be served only by LADWP.  This is identical
to ABX1 54.

ABX2 14 (Canciamilla) - This bill would permit entities to sell gas
in-state without being classified as a public utility and would allow
for the sale of low grade gas.  This is identical to ABX1 73.

Here's a quick update on the Minnesota energy bill.  

Conference committee met all thru the weekend and this afternoon recommended 
a compromise bill, SF #722.   The final bill should be voted on tonight 
before the legislature adjourns at midnight.  

We won one of two issues we were focused on.  The streamlining of 
transmission survived.  The elimination of certificate of need did not.....it 
got wrapped up in the debate over a 10% renewable portfolio mandate by 2015.  
At the end of the horsetrading, the certifcate of need fell victim to the 
enviros.  Their RPS that they thought they had locked was reduced to setting 
goals of achieving a level of 10% of Minnesota supplies as renewables and 
requiring green pricing to be instituted.  The enviros were then adamant that 
no power plants should be exempted from certificate of need. 

The third issue that we were backing is still alive--it just got transfered 
over to the tax committee.  The language to exempt new power plant personal 
property from taxes is still alive in both the House and the Senate, although 
the language in the Senate is much better. It appears that a tax bill and a 
budget bill will not be agreed to by adjournment, so government will shut 
down June 1 if action isn't taken.  Jesse will call a special session next 
week and they will pass a tax bill before the June 1 date.

Lastly,there are two other provisions that we will benefit from---language on 
joint finance that will allow munis and coops to enter into projects that 
they may have felt they were unable to in the past.  This may create come 
business opportunities for our ENA folks.   The other provision was a  
pleasant surprise that I thought would end up on the cutting floor that 
survived--there will be rulemaking for interconnection standards for 
distributed generation of up to 10 MW.

Subject: G&RA HR Update   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Thanks for reducing some of our discussion on Monday evening to a summary and 
action items. My comments more or less in the order of your spreadsheet:
 - Manager for German speaking countries; my view is that though we may feel 
dispirited by lack of recruitment success and have resolved to get short term 
help to Paul in the shape of some time from Jan Haizmann, we should not 
abandon trying to fill the position. While we may identify an analyst or 
associate capable of taking a G&RA rotation on Germany, the level at which 
such a person could operate and the potential period of availability may be 
severe constraints. I'm sure the other three of us will be willing to 
reinforce Paul H's exposure to the demanding recruitment process. Sophie had 
some creative ideas for sourcing.
 - Brendan Devlin; he started today. Doug and I have agreed that pro tem he 
does about two thirds continental gas and one third EU other businesses/ 
topics. Action was for you or Sophie to check on his documentation, let Doug 
and me see his contract and see whether Brendan has filled in and submitted 
medical questionnaire.
 - Wilke and Charman; I think Doug and I regard them as C&EE candidates not 
continental gas. I hope Doug will anyway co-ordinate our reversion to each of 
them post-interview with you. He knows my views. 
 - Manager for EU; this position does not necessarily have to be located in 
Brussels and is as much pan-European in nature as strictly EU; need to fill 
it will depend partly on Brendan's future balance of work, partly on Nailia 
Dindarova's development, and partly on evolving demands on us from 
continental power, industrial and global markets, a prospective renewables 
business, NetWorks etc. I am interested in evaluating candidates as they pop 
up, but concerted recruitment effort and precise job description on hold.
 - Unmentioned issues: Jan Haizmann's PRC process formalities and David 
Gonzalez' future with us need to be resolved (former faster than latter!) 
Also I forgot to mention on Monday that we have found a temoporary research 
assistant for Teun van Biert: Mabel Pigmans; I have asked him to call you 
about her contract - it will probably be best arranged under Dutch law as a 
service agreement through one of our law firms there.

As folks know, I am sending our suggested legislative language to DOE this 
afternoon,  The package you were asked to review contained legislative 
language making RTO participation mandatory.  After further discussions with 
Tom Briggs, I am not sending the mandatory RTO language as a part of our 
package.  My concern with sending it as legislative language is that this 
would muddy the waters on our open access rulemaking (a draft of which we are 
getting this Friday from Watkiss and which we plan to transmit to DOE next 
week).  FERC has existing authority to make RTO participation mandatory.  
Thus, instead of fighting out the issue in the legislative sphere, we should 
reserve it for a possible rulemaking in open access.  We decided not to two 
track open access, so I don't think we want to two track mandatory RTOs.  If 
anyone disagrees with this strategy, we can send it first thing Thursday in 
legislative form to DOE.

SBC WITHDRAWS BID TO OFFER InterLATA SERVICES IN MISSOURI

SBC Communications, Inc., today withdrew its petition to offer
in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) services in
Missouri in the face of FCC concerns about rates for unbundled
network elements and the adequacy of its operation support
systems (OSSs).

SBC said it would provide "additional evidence" supporting its
Missouri application and refile a petition with the FCC "as soon
as possible."  The FCC would have 90 days after the filing of the
new petition to decide whether SBC had complied with section 271
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which mandates that Bell
operating companies meet a 14-point "competitive checklist" of
market-opening requirements before they can offer in-region
interLATA services.

Refiling the application would enable SBC to "further address
questions raised by the Department of Justice and others over
SBC's original application, as well as provide updated evidence
of continued compliance with section 271," SBC said.  Justice
didn't recommend that the FCC reject the application, but it did
raise several questions, including whether SBC's unbundled
network element rates in Missouri complied with the FCC's TELRIC
(total-element long-run incremental cost) standard (TR, May 14).

"We believe our application for Missouri passes all the tests,
and Missouri regulators agreed by unanimously endorsing our
application," said Priscilla Hill-Ardoin, SBC senior vice
president.  "Our markets are open, as the rapid growth of
competition in the state demonstrates.  But it is important that
our application record include a comprehensive response to
several new issues raised since our Missouri application was
filed.  We would rather the FCC vote on the most current
information available."

In a statement issued late this afternoon, FCC Chairman Michael
K. Powell said, "During the FCC Common Carrier Bureau's review of
SBC's section 271 application for authority to offer long
distance service in Missouri, concerns surfaced related to cost-
based pricing in its region and operation support systems (OSS).
Given these concerns SBC has chosen to withdraw the application."
Mr. Powell said the proceeding was "terminated until such time as
SBC has addressed these issues and is prepared to resubmit its
application."

LAWMAKERS, POLICY ADVOCATES PITCH BROADBAND SERVICE BILLS

With key votes on broadband services legislation approaching in
the House -- including a possible floor vote on HR 1542 later
this month -- telecom lawmakers and industry officials today made
a new round of policy pitches on the subject.  Their audience was
the more than 100 congressional staffers at today's Internet
Caucus luncheon in the U.S. Capitol.

The luncheon at times seemed like a mini-hearing:  Lawmakers
offered their usual arguments, challenged each other's claims,
and asked those in attendance for support.  In a separate panel
held later, industry representatives drew swords over broadband
services legislation.

Carrying the flag for the Bell companies' bill of choice, the
Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act, HR 1542, were Rep.
W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.), its author, and Reps. Rick Boucher
(D., Va.), and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.).  Filling out the
congressional panel were two of the more outspoken skeptics of
the data-relief legislation -- Reps. Steve Largent (R., Okla.)
and Christopher Cannon (R., Utah).

Rep. Largent argued that HR 1542's provision to eliminate the in-
region interLATA (local access and transport area) restrictions
on the Bell companies' provision of data services would remove
the Bells' incentive to open their local markets.  "It's like
changing the rules of the game in the middle of the game," he
said.  "No other industry has that kind of domination by one
entity. . .like the Bells do in the local loop."

Rep. Tauzin fired back, saying the Bell companies were "always in
the middle of a game."  The 14-point market-opening check-list
found in section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 "has
become 1,100 points," he said.  "And the FCC has gummed things up
so badly, that AT&T [Corp.] can sit there beautifully and stymie
entry" into the cable modem market, he said.

HR 1542 would correct that discrepancy and spur competition by
putting the Bells' provision of advanced services on equal
regulatory footing with the broadband offerings of cable TV
providers, said Reps. Boucher and Tauzin.  "But AT&T loves the
status quo so much. . .that's why they've spent all this money on
TV ads opposing" HR 1542, Rep. Tauzin said.  There is a "good
chance" that HR 1542 will be taken up on the House floor before
the July 4 break, he said.

Rep. Cannon, who advocates a different approach to spurring
advanced service deployment, said AT&T Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer C. Michael Armstrong told him yesterday that
Congress's consideration of HR 1542 has contributed to Wall
Street's sour outlook on the competitive local exchange carrier
(CLEC) industry.

"Mr. Armstrong said he had no interest in buying a [CLEC] as long
as HR 1542 is out there," Rep. Cannon said.  "I don't agree that
those companies are failing because of bad business plans," he
added.  "The Bells have blocked their access" to local markets.

During the industry panel, HR 1542's provision to scale back the
FCC's rules on "line sharing" sparked debate between Larry
Clinton, vice president-large company affairs for the U.S.
Telecom Association, and Thomas Koutsky, VP-law and public policy

"If you want competition for local phone service, you don't want
line sharing," Mr. Clinton told attendees.  But Mr. Koutsky said
"the point of line sharing and unbundling was to provide rings
for CLECs to climb into the market."  Passage of HR 1542 would
remove those market-access elements, he said.

CARRIERS ASK WIRELESS BUREAU TO RETHINK `E911' DECISION

Four carriers have asked the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau to reconsider its decision regarding who should pay for
Phase I enhanced "911" (E911) systems.  In a May 7 letter, bureau
Chief Thomas J. Sugrue said the 911 selective router maintained
by incumbent local exchange carriers was the proper demarcation
point for allocating E911 implementation costs between wireless
carriers and public safety answering points (PSAPs) (TR, May 14).
Mr. Sugrue was responding to a request for clarification from the
King County, Wash., E911 program (TR, Aug. 21, 2000).

The bureau's decision supported the PSAPs' argument regarding the
demarcation point.  Carriers, on the other hand, had maintained
that PSAPs should be responsible for E911 network components or
upgrades beginning at the wireless carrier's mobile switching
center, not the 911 selective router.

In a petition filed yesterday in Common Carrier docket 94-102,
Qwest Wireless LLC, Verizon Wireless, VoiceStream Wireless Corp.,
and Nextel Communications, Inc., said the bureau's decision "is
inconsistent with the Commission's rules and underlying orders
and is beyond the bureau's delegated authority."  They asked the
bureau to designate the mobile switching center as the
demarcation point.

The carriers charged that the bureau failed to follow the Ad-
ministrative Procedure Act's mandate that it consider and respond
to "significant" comments filed in the record of the proceeding.
The companies also said the bureau's decision required a formal
rulemaking by the full Commission.

MCI SHARES BEGIN TRADING AGAIN, AS WorldCom ISSUES TRACKING STOCK

WorldCom, Inc., has split each share of its common stock into two
tracking stocks, one of which will reflect the performance of the
unit that provides long distance service to consumers and small
businesses.  WorldCom is calling that unit the MCI Group because
WorldCom acquired most of that business when it bought MCI
Communications Corp.  The MCI Group also includes WorldCom's
wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access operations.

The other tracking stock will reflect the performance of the
WorldCom Group, which includes the company's high-growth data,
Internet, international, and commercial voice businesses.  Each
existing WorldCom share has been converted into one WorldCom
Group tracking share and 1/25 of an MCI Group tracking share.

Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's president and chief executive
officer, has been talking for nearly a year about separating the
slow-growing consumer long distance business from the faster-
growing WorldCom operations (TR, July 31, 2000).  The split was
approved today at a shareholders meeting in Clinton, Miss.

The two tracking stocks will provide "two distinct, clear, and
compelling investment opportunities," Mr. Ebbers said.  The MCI
Group stock will pay a quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share;
WorldCom shares won't pay a dividend.  The new shares will begin
trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq stock market.

AT&T COMPLETES CABLE MODEM `OPEN-ACCESS' TRIAL

AT&T Broadband today said it had completed a six-month trial in
Boulder, Colo., that allowed multiple Internet service providers
(ISPs) to offer high-speed access over AT&T's cable modem
platform.  The company said it was "on schedule" to offer
consumers their choice of cable modem ISPs by mid-2002.

AT&T Broadband said more than 300 end-users and four ISPs
participated in the trial, which cost about $20 million.  The
Boulder trial will be extended for two months in a limited area
to continue evaluating the "service agent" software.  Customers
use that software to register for and connect to an ISP.

AT&T also plans to continue testing billing and customer-care
features before launching a limited commercial program in
Massachusetts that will let customers choose their cable modem
ISP.  That launch is slated for later this year.

John and Carey,

I attach an outline of the report we are aiming to produce on the current 
regulations governing the construction, ownership and operation of IPPs and 
associated facilities in Japan so far as they relate to EPower's activities. 
The outline also includes an implementation schedule. As previously 
mentioned, the aim is to have the report together with recommendations 
completed by mid next month.

The response to the review from EPower has been very positive so far. We are 
receiving assistance from all quarters within the company. Initial 
indications are that EPower already has a good amount of the primary 
information necessary for the review in some form or other. However, to date 
there appears to have been limited analysis of that information by EPower to 
determine the implications for project costs and schedules and how to 
minimize potential delays. The report will aim address these issues. 



I would welcome any comments you may have.

kind regards

As most of you are aware, the FERC mediator yesterday submitted his 
recommendation to the agency, culminating a 15-day mediation process. Among 
the mediator's recommendations is that FERC convene an evidentiary hearing, 
to close within 60 days, to determine the offset or refund liability of 
suppliers of energy, including Enron, into the California's spot markets.  I 
expect FERC to act on the recommendation early next week and issue an order 
directing that a hearing be convened within possibly a week or less.  
Accordingly, getting organized is an imperative.

Several of us participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss whether 
Enron should retain Seabron Adamson of Frontier Economics to serve as Enron's 
expert in the hearing.  The decision was made to retain Seabron for this 
purpose.  Seabron has informed me that he can come to Washington to start 
preparing discovery and developing a theory for Enron's case.  The discovery 
that Enron pursues will obviously need to be coordinated with litigation 
counsel representing Enron in the various California civil litigations and 
investigations.

The mediator's recommendation largely ignores two of the issues that were set 
for mediation (moving CA power supply to the forward markets and restoring 
creditworthiness of CA purchasers) and instead deals exclusively with the 
third issue:  Did any supplier overcharge for post-October 1, 2000, 
short-term (24 hrs or less) sales into the PX and ISO and, if so, should the 
supplier refund the overcharge or have it offset against amounts owed the 
supplier?

The mediator did not find a specific overcharge amount. Instead, he opined 
that, while not the $8.9 billion claimed by the CA delegation, overcharges 
"do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion 
dollars in an aggregate sum."

Per the mediator's recommendation, the evidentiary hearing should address the 
details of a methodology for determining how much each supplier overcharged.  
The "single" methodology recommended by the mediator is a modified, 
retroactive application of the price ceiling that FERC ordered imposed 
prospectively on the entire west in a June 19 order.  That methodology 
classes as an overcharge any amount charged between October 2, 2000, and May 
28, 2001, that exceeded the operating cost of the least efficient gas-fired 
turbine dispatched in CA in an hour plus an adder for O&M, a credit premium 
and NOx.  The recommended methodology deviates from the prospective price 
ceiling in several respects, including that it would be applied in all hours, 
without discount, and would reflect actual heat rates and separate actual 
hourly natural gas prices for southern CA and northern CA, resulting in two 
separate proxy prices.

The mediator recommends that this methodology be applied to all suppliers, 
even those that did not supply power wholly from gas-fired turbines.   
Nevertheless, in a contradictory passage, the mediator goes on to recognize 
that his recommended methodology "may not be appropriate for all sellers," 
but that any sellers advocating a different methodology "should bear the 
burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the 
methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period.."  (emphasis 
added).

Assuming that the agency largely follows the recommendation of the mediator, 
then it appears Enron, working through Seabron, can pursue one or two basic 
theories.  First and most simply, Enron can accede to the mediator's 
methodology and work with the large generators (Duke, Reliant, Dynegy, 
Mirant) to force up the proxy price (and lower the overcharge amount) that 
the mediator's methodology produces.  Alternatively, in addition to trying to 
force up the proxy price, Enron can try to develop a theory that the 
mediator's methodology either should not apply to power marketers or should 
apply differently to them.  This second approach will likely be joined by 
other non-thermal generator suppliers, such as PowerEx.  The obvious risk in 
pursing this second approach is that Enron might become exposed to discovery 
into the cost basis of its book over the entire refund period..

Those of you who will need or want to discuss the issues with Seabron, please 
respond by letting me know as between Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next 
week, which works better for you for a meeting in Washington or a 
teleconference.

In an Era of Deregulation, Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever

By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hour 
with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's 
national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.

Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other 
things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron 
and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's 
electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building 
new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush 
unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities.

In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other 
energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says he 
sought Mr. Lay's advice because "Enron has a different take than most energy 
companies."

Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the 
past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest 
trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such 
as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's 
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.

Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with 
government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based company, which was 
President George W. Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up 
its lobbying staff, boosted its political contributions and sought out 
friends in the world of politics. Now, with Mr. Bush in the White House, it 
is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.

Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of 
deregulation. Just as government created immense telephone, electric and gas 
monopolies early in the last century, Enron and other players feel they need 
the government's help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to 
once-closed markets.

In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure 
that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company. Rather than 
having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the utilities, it wants 
those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to 
buy and sell power.

Mr. Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush 
cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the 
Texas governor's mansion with Mr. Bush. Before joining the administration, 
both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative 
Robert Zoellick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annual 
stipend of $50,000.

Under Mr. Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr. Bush during his 
political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and its 
employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive, the 
Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center for 
Responsive Politics. Enron also accounted for $461,000 in contributions 
during Mr. Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Public 
Integrity.

Mr. Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from 
government is a fair shake. Enron supports candidates "you believe in," he 
says. "You believe in their value system, you believe in their philosophy and 
you believe they'll do the right things as leaders."

But it's clear that Mr. Lay wants more than that from government. For now, he 
is focusing on FERC, where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was 
known as the Federal Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in 
beating back the power of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater 
overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities, the 
commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nation's transition to a 
fully deregulated energy marketplace.

Even before Mr. Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market power 
of utilities. In December, FERC told the nation's utilities that it wanted 
them to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines -- those that can 
dispatch electricity across state lines -- to independent grid operators, 
such as those already in place in California and the Northeast, which would 
provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to submit 
plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of 
their lines to such independent organizations.

Mr. Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct 
control of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls 
energy "balkanization" and create "seamless" interstate electricity markets.

"Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the 
competitive side of the business," says Andre Meade, an analyst for 
Commerzbank. "To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows 
down."

Right now it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly 
controlled markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout and 
risk-management savvy to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it 
frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.

In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants, 
sometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using 
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the 
power, finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned 
by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale 
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for 
electricity in the first quarter alone. Such growth pushed Enron's wholesale 
energy-trading income, before taxes and interest, up more than threefold to 
$785 million during the first quarter.

Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979 
million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over 
the same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than 
fourfold.

At the start of the Bush administration, FERC's future was very much up for 
grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron quickly 
sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush named a friend 
of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulator Pat Wood. 
Mr. Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort to open 
Texas' retail electricity market. Mr. Wood also had shown the kind of 
backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he 
insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their 
networks to competitors.

Higher Profile
For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utility 
regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block an 
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and by 
GOP Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of 
the Philadelphia market.

Enron worked to raise Ms. Brownell's visibility by lobbying the House 
Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and 
as a member of an informal advisory group, say Enron and congressional aides. 
Mr. Lay provided heavyweight support. He says Enron included Ms. Brownell's 
name on its "priority list" of a half-dozen prospective FERC nominees. And 
when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with 
bitter memories of her 1997 decision, Mr. Lay says he phoned Karl Rove, the 
White House's top political strategist, to tell him that "she was a strong 
force in getting the right outcome" in Pennsylvania."

A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry 
groups weighed in favor of Ms. Brownell, but she declined to name any. Ms. 
Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf. 
She didn't ask the White House who had supported her because, she says, "I 
didn't want to be beholden."

Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties 
with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the commission. Earlier this 
spring, the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gore's closest 
friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr. Gore's 
campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms. Breathitt 
through Democratic politics.

Ms. Breathitt says she wasn't very familiar with Enron's interests, but that 
she accepted when Mr. Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant 
in April to meet Richard Shapiro, Enron's managing director for government 
affairs. "Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners," Ms. 
Breathitt says, adding that she always pays for her own meals.

Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr. Lay has been friendly 
with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past 25 years, 
sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford. He's 
been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the late 1980s, he 
ran then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's fund-raising drives in Texas. 
After the younger Bush became governor, he appointed Mr. Lay to run the 
influential Governor's Business Council. Mr. Lay also made Enron's fleet of 
corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying 
officials considering Enron projects.

In March 1997, Mr. Lay wrote Gov. Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas 
congressional delegation to support export-finance credits critical to Enron, 
according to letters released by the Texas State Archivist's office. In April 
1997, when Enron was negotiating a $2 billion natural-gas joint venture in 
Uzbekistan, Mr. Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the 
Uzbekistani ambassador to the U.S. Six months later, another Lay thank-you 
note concerned a phone call Mr. Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov. Ridge to 
support Enron's plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market. "I am 
certain it will have a positive impact," Mr. Lay wrote.

Mr. Lay says he hasn't sought Mr. Bush's aid directly since Mr. Bush won the 
presidency. Last month, he talked with the president briefly at a Houston 
benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, on which Mr. Lay 
serves as co-chairman. "It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing 
or sitting around and having drinks," he says.

Not all Mr. Lay's initiatives have been successful. When Mr. Bush reneged in 
March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in 
carbon-dioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons, Mr. Lay says he 
telephoned Mr. Cheney to complain. "The scientific evidence, although 
certainly not conclusive, is pretty compelling that there could be a 
climate-change problem," he says he told the vice president. "The 
administration should still look very seriously at it."

Around the same time, Mr. Lay also called Mr. Rove, the White House political 
adviser, to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp, the head of the moderate 
Environmental Defense Fund. Messrs. Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found 
little common ground. Later, Enron, which has plans to add emission credits 
to the commodities it trades, joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions 
in carbon-dioxide levels.

But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr. Cheney's energy task force. In 
April, Mr. Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and 
later, with Mr. Cheney, whom Mr. Lay had come to know well when the vice 
president was chief of Halliburton Co., a Dallas construction company. "We 
built Enron Field together," says Mr. Lay, referring to Houston's new 
ballpark.

In both meetings, say Enron and White House officials, Mr. Lay presented a 
broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical system and used the 
gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both cases, he argues, 
pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system 
that offers easy access to all.

Finding the Bottlenecks
The Cheney report uses similar language, describing the electrical grid as 
"the highway for interstate commerce in electricity." As Enron sought, the 
report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year 
whether it makes sense to establish a national grid, and to identify 
bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them. An 
effort to make the grid national would enhance FERC's power, as Enron has 
urged.

The report is mum on some Enron concerns, such as requiring utilities to join 
regional transmission organizations, an idea strongly opposed by the utility 
industry. A White House aide says the task force didn't want to get involved 
in such battles between industries.

As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be, Enron is 
worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states 
and possibly in New York, should electricity rates surge this summer. Nevada 
repealed its deregulation law last month, spooked by the way skyrocketing 
wholesale-electricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the 
Golden State's economy. California and Oregon are contemplating 
state-government purchases of major utility assets.

Enron's biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states, or 
perhaps Congress, to control prices, which could undermine Enron's business.

In response, Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers 
in New York, who each have pledged $50,000 to pay for a media and lobbying 
campaign. It also has hired former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot and dispatched 
him to court Western politicians. Two weeks ago, Mr. Racicot had breakfast 
with an old colleague, Oregon's Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber. After the two 
chatted about fly-fishing, says Mr. Kitzhaber, "Marc did say he was working 
to re-energize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework 
the governors might want to consider."

Though Mr. Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr. Racicot had joined the Washington, 
D.C., lobbying firm Bracewell & Patterson, Mr. Racicot didn't disclose that 
he was on retainer to Enron -- and the star of Enron's Western states 
"advocacy team." For his part, Mr. Racicot says he was working "not at 
Enron's direction but with their knowledge" to advance positions that he, 
too, feels are important.

Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity."  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

Nick, just confirming our discussion re Rob. As you would be aware Rob 
reports to Paul and myself. This reflected the fact that his role whilst 
primarily Regulatory Affairs  also has a legal component.  

Mark Schroeder was his functional report and also his conduit into the 
Regulatory Affairs PRC process. Both Paul and myself would welcome you taking 
over this role. As discussed,   I believe Rob would benefit from your 
suggestion of a regular phone discussion at weekly or two-weekly intervals. 
These sessions could provide some useful Regulatory Affairs mentoring.  This 
would supplement what we are doing to encourage Rob to both be more 
pro-active on commercial issues and also promote his  career development with 
in Regulatory Affairs. On the PRC process we will continue to do Rob's 
appraisal here and pass through assessments for you to represent Rob in 
within the Reg. Affairs.         

Again Nick we appreciate your taking on this role. 

David Minns

Update on Texas Deregulation: 
Myriad of Issues Converge as Pilot Kicks Off 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]The City of Dallas has become another of Texas' major customers to 
take advantage of the savings available in the state's emerging competitive 
electric market. The city has signed an electricity contract with AES 
NewEnergy. Under the terms of the contract, AES NewEnergy will provide 
electricity to approximately 100 service accounts located at municipal sites 
throughout the city that are currently served by TXU Electric. The city of 
Dallas, one of the nation's largest cities, has a population of more than 1 
million people. 

Analysis: The date at which Texas customers will begin to receive power from 
new suppliers under the state's electric pilot program has been pushed back 
to mid-July, but today marks the start of when new suppliers begin turning in 
their bid forecasts to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). 
Full electric competition begins in Texas on Jan. 1, 2002. Thus, it's a good 
time to do an assessment of the many interesting dynamics that have emerged 
in the Lone Star State, some of which might pose unique challenges to the 
state's electric market. As Texas continues to prepare for full competition, 
its electric pilot program is getting off to a rather slow start (at least on 
the residential side), an ongoing debate about incorporating Texas into the 
national transmission grid continues, and ERCOT defends itself against claims 
that the state should be "closely watched" this summer. At the same time, Pat 
Wood, the state's highest-ranking utility regulator, marks his departure from 
Texas to assume a position with FERC. 

In previous columns, I've established the main points of Texas' restructuring 
plan (see 3/6/01 IssueAlert at www.scientech.com/rcifor a review). As 
incumbent utilities in Texas are allowed to create unregulated energy 
providers that can compete outside their traditional service territory, an 
interesting game of musical chairs is taking place among the various 
incumbent competitors. For instance, Dallas-based TXU is positioning itself 
to hold on to its North Texas customers while expanding into Houston, while 
Houston-based Reliant attempts to retain its base in Houston while moving 
into Dallas. At the same time, new competitors (AES NewEnergy among them) 
have moved into the state, attempting to get a jumpstart on securing 
customers during this pilot phase. At last count, 19 regional electric 
providers have registered with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) 
to provide power to Texas customers. Also worth noting is the fact that, 
after much speculation, I recently confirmed that AEP has indeed registered 
as a retail electric provider (REP) in Texas under the name Mutual Energy, 
representing approximately one million customers. 

First, let's look at the electric pilot program. After issuing a recent delay 
in the start date for the pilot (originally slated for June 1) to ensure that 
computer systems were running effectively, those Texas customers 
participating in the pilot should start receiving power from new providers in 
mid-July. State officials had high hopes that most of the 5 percent of the 
state's electric customers eligible to participate in the pilot would select 
a new electric provider. However, at last count, fewer than 15 percent of the 
261,000 residential customers that are eligible have signed up since 
enrollment in the pilot began Feb. 15 (this represents about 1 percent of 
TXU's residential customers and 3 percent of those currently served by 
Reliant).  

The pilot officially ends when full competition begins. Fears arising from 
the national coverage of the California situation appear to be dissuading 
Texas residential customers from participating, along with general apathy 
about electric service. Also at play is a 6-percent discount that residential 
and small business customers receive from their incumbent utilities, which 
may lower the incentive for these customers to seek out a new provider. 

While Texas residential customers appear hesitant (or apathetic) about 
electric competition, the state's large industrial and commercial customers 
are eagerly embracing the opportunity to sign on with a new electric 
provider. There are about 2,000 large electric users in the state (defined as 
those businesses that consume more than 1 MW of power at peak usage). 
C_customers have filled up many of the slots available in the pilot program 
for their customer classes, and naturally appear to be generating the most 
competition in the state.  

Within this space, AES NewEnergy is gaining momentum. In addition to its 
contract with the city of Dallas, NewEnergy also secured a deal with H-E-B, 
one of Texas' leading retail companies with 280 stores in the state. AES 
NewEnergy is a subsidiary of AES Corp. (NYSE: AES), which controls more than 
64,000 MW in 32 countries. Formed in 1995, AES NewEnergy claims to be present 
in "very state where a competitive energy market is emerging." I spoke with 
representatives from the city of Dallas regarding their selection of AES 
NewEnergy among other providers, including those based in Texas. 
Interestingly, NewEnergy was the only REP that responded to the city's bid. 

Another large deal was recently announced between Cinemark USA, which 
operates movie theaters around the state, and TXU. Under the contract, TXU 
will provide energy services to 22 Cinemark theaters outside of its 
traditional North Texas service territory. Unlike the city of Dallas, which 
only received a bid from one REP, comparative price was a factor in 
Cinemark's selection of TXU. 

Whether or not Texas should be forced to join the nation's transmission grid 
is a debate that has been heating up over the last few weeks. Ironically, 
although President Bush usually supports free market forces, he reportedly is 
considering a mandate that would force ERCOT into becoming interconnected 
with the nation's two other transmission grids, the Western Interconnection 
and the Eastern Interconnection. Presently, ERCOT stands independent from the 
other two grids and wants to keep it that way. However, because Texas is 
generally thought to have excess power, it is now being considered that the 
Lone Star State should be made to export some of that supply to power-starved 
California. Presently this is not possible due to the fact that ERCOT has 
limited interconnections to surrounding power pools. 

This is not the first time that this issue has been tossed around. While 
President Bush was still governor of the state, the Public Utility Commission 
of Texas (PUCT) studied the option of linking Texas to the other grids and 
found that it would be cheaper for the state to remain disconnected. However, 
as the issue of FERC's oversight over regional transmission organizations 
gains momentum, the Bush administration may overrule Texas' current 
sovereignty over its transmission system. Further, the debate on this issue 
is related to the policy of eminent domain in the Bush administration's 
energy plan, which would give FERC the power to buy state property for the 
construction of interstate transmission lines. 

However, the question of just how much excess generation Texas might have to 
give to California has come into question over the last several weeks. The 
North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) sparked the controversy 
recently when it issued a report identifying a number of areas in the United 
States that should be "watched closely" this summer due to supply concerns. 
In the same report, NERC also mentioned that Texas should be watched closely, 
but out of concern about the state's pilot program rather than supply 
deficiencies. ERCOT immediately disputed NERC's claim, reiterating the 
state's oft-repeated contention that it is more than prepared for competition 
and in fact has a 17.9 percent reserve power margin. In addition, Texas 
officials point to the fact that, since 1995, 22 new plants have started 
operations in the state, generating 5,700 MW. By the time competition begins 
fully in January 2002, 15 more plants and 10,000 MW are scheduled to come 
online. Nevertheless, in response, NERC stood behind its assessment, which it 
based on two possible ramifications of the summer's pilot. NERC is concerned 
that as Texas consolidates 10 control areas into one and 5 percent of the 
state's utility customers switch to new providers as is hoped by the state, 
this could take a toll on transmission capability. 

Another challenge facing Texas is the shrinkage of its regulatory commission. 
As noted, Pat Wood has now officially left his post as chairman of the PUCT 
to become a FERC commissioner. Wood's departure leaves only Brett Perlman as 
the sole PUCT commissioner, something that concerns many stakeholders as a 
number of final decisions on rules that will govern Texas' electric market 
are still pending. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made no announcement as to when 
Wood might be replaced on the PUCT (along with Judy Walsh, who left the 
commission last January).  

Moreover, the fact that the state's pilot program has not attracted a large 
number of residential customers is not surprising. Texas may not have a 
strong competitive residential market for some time, considering the 
6-percent discount for residential and small business customers that was 
included in the state's restructuring plan. Rather, the competitive C_market, 
which is where the largest savings can be obtained anyway, may be the true 
test of the success of Texas' competitive market. This determining factor, 
along with the state's ability to retain a strong power supply, ultimately 
will decide the fate of Texas' electric industry. Because the vast majority 
of the new generation in Texas is fueled by natural gas, there are also some 
related concerns about competitors being able to beat the fixed rates of 
utility REPs if natural-gas prices remain high. However, despite these 
factors, Texas is clearly gearing up for competition and pursuing 
deregulation in its own independent fashion. The eyes of the energy industry 
remain fixed on Texas as the state-which by the way will reportedly soon 
become the largest state in terms of megawatts generated-continues its 
attempts to distance itself from the national debate that has somewhat 
tainted electric deregulation.

Rick:

I have a large set of comments on the full paper from Christi Nicollay (who
has been corrdinating this), plus the others. We will make changes as
appropriate. Sabine and I have also started a bit on the shorter version
just so we will be ready ont hat front.

At some point I guess we still need to have the conversation with Steve
(Maureen is trying to get a new date). From my perspective it would also be
useful if you and I could have a quick chat sometime. Otherwise I think we
risk losing the plot due to the elapsed time.

I will be in Toronto and DC for much of the week but you can try me on my
cellphone number (617) 513-5904.

California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Assemblymember Barbara  Matthews 
(D-Tracy/Stockton area), held a press conference today to "introduce"  two 
new "whistleblowers" from Duke Energy's South Bay plant.? Bustamante  and 
Matthews have filed a class action suit against out of state energy  
companies.
?
The two employees, E. Robert Edwards (who spent 22 years at  the plant as an 
electrician) and Richard J. Connors (21 years, started as a  laborer and rose 
to auxillary operator), said they had little new to offer but  were there to 
back up the testimony of the three former plant employees who  testified 
before Sen. Dunn's committee.? Among their claims were that the  plant did 
not run at its potential capacity during periods of rolling blackouts,  that 
part supplies were reduced or removed to slow maintenance, and even that  the 
emphasis on safety was reduced.? 
?
Edwards said that?the?225 MW Unit 4 was kept offline  during a period of 
rolling blackouts.? He also said that Units 1 and 2 were  run at 100 MW 
instead of their 150 MW capacity.
?
Connors noted that units were taken offline on weekends, and  that employees 
"dreaded" Sunday night-Monday morning shifts because "they would  have to run 
around" to bring units on line.? A Duke spokesman said after  the press 
conference that they do shut down some of the units on weekends  because the 
state doesn't need the power and the cost of production is higher  than the 
market price.
?
The employees also claimed that one turbine which uses liquid  fuel was used 
more than they ever remember in place of steam turbines.?  Connors said the 
15 MW generated through the use of jet fuel, oil, etc. could  have easily 
been produced by making adjustments to one of the operating steam  turbines.
?
Ray Boucher, the attorney on the case, said the alleged  actions could 
violate anti-trust laws.? He claimed that documents say Duke  bought the 
South Bay plant because they knew it would enable them to exercise  market 
power.
?
Bustamante dismissed the ISO's confirmation that it had  ordered the plant 
to?ramp?up and down during Jan. 16-18, the period  discussed by the three 
previous whistleblowers.? He said that Duke's  withholding of electricity and 
bidding practices had affected how the ISO had  been forced to manage power, 
and that it is essential to examine bidding records  during that period.
?
Boucher said even though the state is looking at $9 billion in  alleged 
overcharges, the class action suit could ask for more.? "I think it  goes 
deeper than that (the $9 billion)," he said.
?
Bustamante made two incorrect statements during the press  conference.? He 
tried to bolster the credibility of Connors and Edwards by  saying that they 
had been kept on the job for two years after the plant's  takeover by Duke, 
which shows their value.? He was reminded that AB 1890  required keeping 
existing employees for?two years.? (Connors said he  was offered employment 
by Duke but turned them down; Edwards indicated he took  an enhanced 
severance package.)
?
The second was in regard to a claim by one of the former  employees that he 
had been told that the spare parts supply had been reduced in  order to lower 
"inventory taxes."? Bustamante made the comment, "We don't  have an inventory 
tax."? It's true that California no longer taxes  inventory (in retail 
stores, for example), but counties do charge an ad valorem  tax on on-site 
business property.
?
I sat a couple of seats away from Tom Williarms, spokesman for  Duke, 
who?made under-the-breath comments?through most of the press  conference such 
as "That's so wrong."? Following the press conference, he  held an 
availability in the hallway.? He said that there was a fundamental  
difference in operation the employees didn't understand:? The South Bay  
plant now serves the ISO market, while it used to serve a targeted southern  
California market under SDG&E.? Williams also claimed the plant was  under 
severe environmental constraints for NOx that limited its available run  time.
?
Duke, he added, did not want to charge the high prices -- over  $3,000/MWh 
--?it did but included an 80% credit premium because the  utilities were not 
creditworthy.??To date, he said,?it has only  received 1.8 cents on the 
dollar.??Williams said Duke?tried to  sell the power to DWR instead at a much 
lower?rate, but was  refused.?Duke has since refunded some money, Williams  
said,?and?has offered to re-bill at FERC's price-mitigation  rate.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Rick, Jim: 

In a nutshell, an intelligent and bright achiever who can be of use to GA in 
many areas; global assets, EBS, and environmental come to mind very clearly.  
Her politeness, friendless, and actually openness,  indicate that she could 
be a very good team player.   She perceives her  experience in Enron as "very 
positive" and "constructive"; she worked on contractual issues related to 
Thermofloris, and Colombia-Panama Pipeline.

Risk Analytics is not her forte area, and a learning curve is needed.  
However, her abilities-clearly from the resume and from the way she explained 
the details of her experience--indicate that this curve may not be a steep 
one.  Actually, she would be a good addition to a well established Team in 
Risk Analytics in the future when legal issues and their associated risks are 
dealt with.   

I shall take the liberty to communicate with Amy again after she finishes her 
exams in the 3 weeks time and learn more about her points of strength and 
potential areas of contribution.

Of course, I shall keep you posted.

Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further 
Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption.  The 
following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to "immediately 
help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory 
incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure."  The 
Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a 
list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.

Overview of Order

The Order reflects a thorough review of  "all of [FERC's] rate and facility 
certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, 
hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy 
supply"; however, the Commission noted that its authority is "somewhat 
limited."  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the 
lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, 
as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of 
California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection "underscores the 
regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace."  Accordingly, it 
encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for 
western markets.

EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its 
authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the 
Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational 
solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the 
Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, 
including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline 
facilities.

The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, 
include:

-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to 
provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.

-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and 
fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).

-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup 
and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based 
rate authorization.

-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale 
market-based rates.

The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:

-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.

-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly 
increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.

-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year 
depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service 
by November 1, 2002.

-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help 
alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.

EPSA's Comments

In its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be "concise and 
focused."  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the 
following areas:

? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but 
encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to 
sell to creditworthy parties.

? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the 
relative merits of an incremental versus a "rolled in" approach to 
interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus 
on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme 
circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power 
quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant 
recommendation.

? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating 
to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher 
ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The 
Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in 
regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation 
and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher 
ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.

? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on 
the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of 
blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, 
are favorable developments.

We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory 
Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to 
consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal 
legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, 
dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime, 
if you have any questions, please contact either Julie Simon, jsimon@epsa.org 
or Mark Bennett, mbennett@epsa.org at (202 628-8200).

Attached is a description of the action plan for the Load Curtailment efforts 
in CA, ME, and NY this Summer.  If someone from the deal team has not yet 
contacted you, they will be very soon.  If not, let me know.  

The general idea is that we will play against the ISO Load programs with our 
new technology (Sue I know about Cal ISO credit risk).  EES believes that 
with the tremendous amount of volatility this may be a great product.

Fred - I'll leave it to you to set up either one big call or some other 
process to contact appropriate Govt Affairs people.

With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty 
would have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/could 
not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The 
question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support 
from OPG.                                        With respect to point 2, I 
think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's 
/Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are 
delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed 
not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel 
comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative 
report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being 
negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a 
positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the 
OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC 
access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  
the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications 
prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial 
period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency 
plan to accommodate those who are not ready.                                - 
with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with 
our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties   with 
LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul 
next week on our preferred EBT hub.                          -with respect to 
the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and 
the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with   HydroOne and the MEA in 
an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's 
discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved  and the information 
was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne 
execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re       resource adequacy issues and 
we can press this with them as well.                               - with 
respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs 
already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least   one CIS 
vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per 
David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor   to move in quickly to fill 
that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this 
stage.                           - with respect to the customer duplication 
issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to 
discuss this issue with them and to  propose a resolution that would see the 
retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the 
degree of overlap and whether   there was an acceptable solution to any 
problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high.  
Direct is talking to Onsource   and Toronto about this.  I am checking with 
our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK 
market opened and, if so, how it was  resolved. 
.                                      -with respect to customer education, I 
and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne, 
Onsource, Enersource,   and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer 
education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss 
this idea    further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron 
of  up to $200,000.                              - with respect to the 
contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is 
already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency  plan - it will 
likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and 
the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral  account). 
The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not 
ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that   the OEB/gov't is looking 
for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as 
well as the OEB , since ultimately the    decision of whether enough LDCs are 
ready will be a political one.                             These are the 
OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I 
have several  ideas about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss 
with you and Paul.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 
500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the 
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something 
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, 
following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term 
sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap 
structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September 
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall 
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and 
the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce 
a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the 
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a 
position that one LDC  could halt market opening. 

Regards
Rob

		 Subject: Summary of Evil RBOC Campaign

Sue, per our discussion earlier, I wanted to outline the latest on 
Tauzin/Dingell and the UNE proceeding at the FCC.  Over the past 2 days, 
Steve and I met with the staff of Sen. Wyden, Sen. Cantwell, Rep. Largent, 
Rep. Markey, and with Rep. Boucher.  Additionally, we attended an RGA forum 
on "broadband deployment" presented by Verizon and ATT, and  met with reps 
from Comptel.  We also spent some time (off the clock) with Aileen and 
Johnathan Hintzman w/ KDW.  From all of these sources, we came up with the 
following observations/takeaways:

The RBOCs have a very expensive, sophisticated campaign in place to reduce 
access to their high-speed networks (it is now generally accepted that this 
is the main thrust of their effort - not sec.271 relief for data),
This campaign has several facets - the Tauzin/Dingell bill, UNE Petition at 
the FCC, delay/refusal of UNE provisioning to CLECs.  The campaign's main 
themes are that the '96 Act was only to open local networks for voice 
competition, regulatory relief is needed for telcos to compete w/ cable 
monopolies, CLEC business plans are unsound unless they are facilities-based, 
and only use UNEs as a transitional method of entry,
Both the UNE Petition and the T/D Bill would effectively prevent the 
unbundling of ILEC network elements that are classified as "High-speed" or 
"broadband" - meaning wholesale access to any UNE beyond narrowband voice 
facilities would be denied.
Tauzin/Dingell is now on referral to the House Judiciary Cmte.  Judiciary has 
a relative short time to examine the bill (they were only referred the 271 
provision, not the whole legislation) and will then report the bill out with 
or without amendment,
According to Rep. Boucher, the anti-trust language of the Cannon/Conyers 
amendment (which would make unbundling/interconnection complaints against 
ILECs an automatic anti-trust violation) will not likely survive a full cmte 
vote and he believes the bill will go back to Commerce with little change,
Rep. Largent's office told us that they have not developed a floor strategy 
yet to attempt to defeat T/D when it gets to the full House, but they expect 
the final vote to be bitter and very close (probably in favor).
Our meetings with the Senate suggested that they are not likely to take up 
T/D.  We believe that is still the case, especially in a Democrat-controlled 
Senate (which should be determined very soon).  This would make Sen. 
Hollings, an ATT ally, Commerce chairman,
On the regulatory side, Comptel and KDW were both taking the UNE Petition 
very seriously,
Neither Steve nor I are confident that Comptel will carry a very effective 
argument this time - they are pursuing economic and network data that, in the 
end, will not make a convincing argument and will not have significant buy-in 
from other Comptel members.  Their focus on backbone network maps, IRUs, and 
deconstructing the USTA competition report is not constructive,
KDW is leading a group of small CLECs and has invited our participation.  I 
think that we should participate in the effort but hold off in determining 
whether to file our comments with them or separately until we have a better 
feel for the focus of their argument and if we can provide a unique 
perspective,

Based on the above, Steve and I have developed this prognosis:

T/D will likely fail to move in the Senate, though the RBOCs may try some 
different tactics than in the House.
Failing a legislative remedy, the RBOCs full energies will then focus on the 
FCC.
It is very difficult to say how the new commission will rule on the various 
regulatory proceedings there.  However, Congress can send strong cues to the 
commission and opportunities to push back the RBOCs will be available, 
especially if T/D fails in a big way.
The threat that these attempts by the RBOCs pose to EBS is paramount.  
Considering that the RBOCs will likely continue to gain 271 approvals in the 
states, the ability to have below special-access pricing for local 
connectivity will mean the success or failure of bandwidth trading, since 
there would be no way to compete with the Bells on end-to-end bandwidth 
services.

I hope this is helpful as you prepare your download to Ken/Kevin/Jim.  Please 
let Steve or I know if you have any questions or would like additional follow 
up on any of these points.  Thanks

Following up on my previous e-mail regarding ABX 128, I now expect it to
include the following provisions.

1.  The tax will be on excess gross receipts from electrical energy
distribution.
2. The tax will be imposed on the person making the first sale of
electrical power in or into CA for consumer consumption.
3. The tax will be based upon the amount by which the gross receipts
from the sale exceed the amount that would have
been received if the sale had been made at a specified "base price" (to
be determined by the PUC).
4.  There will be a rebuttable presumption that the base price
represents afair sales price.
5.  There will be a withholding mechnism of this excess tax from the
purchasers, other than purchasers who are residential
consumers or small business users.
6.  It will require sellers to file annual tax returns to report the tax
on excess gross receipts and pay any remaining taxes
due.
7.  It will allow sellers to file a claim for refund in an attempt to
rebut the presumption that the base price was a fair sales
price.
8.  Provide certain nexus standards to California to provide the basis
to impose tax liability.
9. Include a 5-year sunset date.

Jeff,

Regarding your voice mail, here is information on today's Dunn hearing:

While today's hearing is still going on, here is what transpired with
Edward Kahn as of 2:40 p.m..

Kahn went over his previously released SCE sponsored report on
withholding.  He discounted the Mirant sponsored Hogan report as
inconclusive and indicated that he will be releasing a response
shortly.  Kahn indicated that Tim Belden refuted his report at a meeting
in Santa Fe but that Tim would not "predictably" release hard copies of
his report.  Kahn also referenced an Enron document addressing his
report contained in an Enron FERC filing.  Senator Dunn told his staff
to make note of Tim's name and the reports.

Senator Dunn indicated that the committee is now in possession of
confidential ISO documents.

Regarding Pescetti, he called Smutney, Gary Ackerman and I into a
meeting.  Gary did not show up.  Anthony discussed four items he is
considering legislatively:

1) Edison deal minus the assets with a rate cap.  He is concerned that
if SCE goes under the state will implement the PPA through drastic
measures.
2) Establishing a 15 month cost-plus rate cap with one condition, the
state must build 10,000 mw within the 15 months or the cap will be
lifted.
3) Direct access (I told him to talk to Dave Kelley before he does
anything)
4) Expedited Path 15 legislation, perhaps with partial generator
funding.

He expressed interest in real time metering as a means to increase
conservation.  Smutney suggested using part of the PPA money to install
meters for all customers.  I told him Enron used these meters with great
success for the industrials.  Anthony had some concern with reliability
so I told him I would get information.  I'm working with Elizabeth
Linell on this.

He also expressed interest in buy-down so I gave him Enron's plan.

Anthony said he is working alone on these proposals.

Scott

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: May 29, 2001

RE: FERC Clarification of Market Mitigation Procedures

On Friday afternoon, the Commission issued an Order clarifying certain 
aspects of its April 26th Order on mitigation measures.  While not addressing 
the rehearing requests or the CAISO compliance filing, the Commission 
established procedures for the CAISO to use alternative information from a 
comparable unit for generators that refuse to provide heat rate and emission 
data to the CAISO.  If an alternative source of data doesn't exist, the CAISO 
can assume the generator is a price-taker and use a bid of $0/MWh for all 
available capacity from that unit.

Second, the Commission rejected the CAISO'a approach to calculating the proxy 
gas price and directed the CAISO to calculate the price using the published 
daily price for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River 
Station), SoCalGas large packages and PG&E large packages.

Third, the Commission rejected the CAISO's decision to apply price mitigation 
only to the Imbalance Energy Market and not to Ancillary Service spot markets 
or Adjustment Bids.

Finally, the Commission granted a request by several California cities to 
require that a creditworthy buyer be in place for all must offer power.

The order is attached.  If you have any questions, contact Julie Simon at 
EPSA at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.

Tonight by a vote of 91/2 (although Senator Wellstone was asking to switch 
his vote; so the final vote may end up being 90/3) the Senate passed the 
Conference Report on the DOD Reauthorization, H.R. 4205.  With the 
overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week, the bill 
will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature.

Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for 
EFS; we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record 
regarding the enforcement interpretation.  Seems EEI's lawyers had submitted 
a colloquy of their own.  Thus, our colloquy successfully served the purpose 
of blocking theirs which we should list as a "victory" given that their 
colloquy would have been damaging to us.  So in the end, Enron achieved all 
its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement 
for the record.

Off the record, we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy 
by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority; possibly 
at the upcoming NARUC meeting.

Bill signature; and thus, Public Law enactment, could occur as early as next 
week.  We will keep you advised as to when this occurs.  Again, 
congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some 
stiff odds.

I've attached a summary of recently proposed NETA modifications.  The BSC 
Panel has recommended the Authority reject Mod P9.  The other mods will be 
considered by the BSC Panel for the first time on May 31st, a meeting which 
Paul and I will attend.  Proposed mods normally then go through a 
consultation and assessment/reporting phase before a decision is made.

Enron has an opinion on three of the mods: P12 (oppose), P15 (support with 
modified timing) and P18 (support option 1).  Elexon recommends P15 and P18 
be treated as urgent, which means the consultation and decision process will 
progress very rapidly.

Regards
Nick

Attached is my first draft of comments - top ten list of needs to promote
bandwidth trading.  THis has not benn circulated around DYN yet, so there's
nothing official about it yet.  Please look over and let me know your
thoughts.  Steve Augustino provided some of the bullets.  Have a great

On Friday, July 6th, we had an excellent first meeting with Com Ed. 

In attendence from Enron were Rogers Herndon, Marc Ulrich, Jeff Merola, Brad 
Snyder, Guy Sharfman and myself.  (Roy Boston and our attorney Chris Townsend 
attended our pre-meeting discussion but did not attend at ComEd to keep our 
numbers down).

In attendence from Com Ed were Pam Strobel President, Exelon Energy Delivery 
Company and Vice Chair, ComEd; Frank Clark, Ex. V.P. Customer Marketing and 
Energy Delivery Services, ComEd; Gerald Rhodes, President, Exelon Energy; 
Arlene Juracek, Vice President, Regulatory & Strategic Services, ComEd; John 
McCawley, Director, Electric and Gas Choice; and Michael Freeman, Long-Term 
Trader, Exelon Power Team.

During the course of the meeting, we delivered our message that we, like 
ComEd, wanted to see a competitive market emerge in Illinois, but that we had 
concern that lifting the PPO early without the presence of a competitive 
market could create a California-like situation - which is what they were 
striving to avoid - because their approach would leave buyers on the 
competitive market without having any sellers due to problems with physical 
delivery.  We indicated our concern for our existing customers and our 
ability to grow our business in Illinois.  We stressed the PJM model as a 
workable solution that creates a liquid market.  There was much enthusiasm on 
the part of ComEd for focusing ICC attention on creating that kind of a 
solution for Illinois.  Arlene Juracek encouraged us to work with them on 
this and to meet with Steve Nauman and Celia David.  Since Mike Roan and I 
will be in Illinois on this Tuesday and Wednesday, first to hear the 
Alliance's presentation to the ICC and then for Mike to make a presentation 
the following day, we are going to try and meet with them.

One of our objectives was to set up a team between Enron and ComEd to go 
through the requirements and nuts and bolts of physical delivery into 
Illinois.  This was accomplished and Jeff Merola and Mark Ulrich witll be 
meeting  with Ann McGlin at ComEd to get a better understanding of what we 
can and cannot do to achieve physical delivery.  Also, Michael Freeman 
indicated a willingness to sell us a structured retail product to help us 
achieve physical delivery (energy and/or load following services), and made 
it clear that whatever deal we do with the Exelon Power team would be 
independent and separate from any deal we might do with ComEd on the PPO 
front.  Once we have completed our discussions with Ann McGlin and with 
Michael Freeman, we will meet again with ComEd to negotiate what we need for 
physical delivery.  

We also discussed other aspects of the ComEd letter to the ICC and received 
the following clarifications.  Customers going off the PPO before 2004 would 
be offered rate 6L which is a bundled rate.  After 2004, ComEd plans to go to 
real time pricing on a day ahead or hourly basis.  As to whether the CTC 
could be reinstated after a customer was dropped from PPO, they indicated 
that they had not thought about it, but believed the law would allow this.  
Arlene Juracek, however, commented that they could lock in a CTC agreement 
with a customer.  I interpret that to mean that as part of an agreement to 
support ComEd in its proposal, we may be able to guarantee that for our 
customers, the CTC will not reemerge if market prices go down or that we can 
negotiate a limited CTC, etc.  

We also pointed out that we had other concerns like ComEd's unwillingness to 
negotiate the Supplier Agreement.  Not much time was spent on that but my 
sense is that if this is an obstacle to getting our concurrence, we may be 
able to work through this as well.

Frank Clark asked us about our willingness to take on the role of supplier of 
last resort and we responded that we needed first to be sure that we could 
physically deliver to customers.  Once that hurdle is addressed, we would be 
willing to consider that possibility.

The ComEd negotiating team will meet in Houston on either the morning of July 
16th or 17th when we believe the tasks with ComEd will be completed, in order 
to evaluate what we have learned and what our next steps should be.  I will 
then arrange a follow-up meeting with Pam Strobel and her team.

FYI in confidence for now, if you wouldn't mind. (For some reason Baumerich 
did not want to copy Paul H.) I can give you the background when we next 
speak. (Nailia, Bruno, Teun, Brendan and I are working on some interesting 
appointments/ events/ visits for you w/c 4 June.)

Subject: Re: REGULATORY AFFAIRS - BOY ARE WE IN TROUBLE  

Gregor, as discussed, I will call after my meeting with Rabensteiner this 
morning to discuss.  In general my assumptions and thoughts are as follows....

a) Medium term, we need to move in the direction of having local nationals - 
instead of AngloSaxons - as our
 lead face deep in the Germanic regulatory arena.  Styles & Hennemeyer will, 
no doubt, continue to have
 significant leadership roles; but, there is no substitute for locals.
b) As the markets get more liquid, especially as clearer national and 
regulatory bodies become established, the
 opportunity for RegAffairs value add increases - not decreases.  Greater 
liquidity and transparency will 
 increase the relative importance of transmission conditions.
c) Market concentration is a big problem and will get much bigger.  This will 
occupy a lot of time over the next few
 years.
d) Inevitably, some of the people we hire will go commercial, others will not 
work-out and others will leave Enron.
 If we try for 6 to 8, we will be lucky to get 3 or 4 by year end.  Of that, 
we will be lucky if 2 or 3 are successful
 RegAffairs people 2 years later.  It takes 2 years to grow our own top 
quality professional.  We are behind.
e) The gas market has only begun to move.  After a two year fight in that 
market we will then have to content with
 gas/power convergence which will introduce yet a new set of concentration 
and transmission and plant siting
 issues.
f) Historically, our RegAffairs people have been our most effective 
communicators in the public arena including
 the media.  As liquidity increases, the pressure to do deals will grow 
exponentially on commercial leads with
 the result that they will step further and further away from the public 
communicatioins arena.  But, particularly
 in Europe, we will continue for a long time to need to maintain a certain 
level of public profile.  Best done by
 a RegAffairs person rather than someone who should be out doing a deal.

I will call later this morning.  Thanks. John T.

Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy

Elizabeth - 

Regulatory Risk Analytics (Cost Center 103246) is to be rolled up to Rick 
Shapiro.  If possible the cost center will be collapsed and the budget rolled 
to Cost Center 100108 and 103885.  It is my understanding that Amr Ibrahim 
will be moving into Harry's group and Regulatory Risk & Analytics will be 
disbanded.

I have printed the SAP report for 103246 and make note that employee costs 
(salary, benefits, taxes) were budgeted but no actuals have hit the cost 
center thus far.  Can you advise if these costs are being rolled to Steve 
Kean.  Can you also advise if these costs cover salary and benefits for Jim 
Steffes and Amr Ibrahim.

I can coordinate with Amanda Schultz on the accounting side of things but 
wanted to check with you on the salary and advise you generally of this 
change.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

Information on capacity release program (VPP) in France

Letter below to the consultants of EDF



Decision on Merger imposing capacity release




Trustee mandate that we proposed to the EU

 

Initial VPP proposal by EDF

Subject: RE: EdF capacity auctions

All,

I would suggest we need to do the following :- 

? Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap.  Bruno could you 
please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document.  I 
assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader "registered" in an EU member 
state?  Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other 
regulatory "qualifiers" such as balancing agreements as yet.  Mark - agree?  
Bruno - could you please take care of sending this registration letter (agree 
with Pierre who should act as principal contact).
? Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of 
approving capacity release phasing, auction process for each phase and 
product specifications AND understand how the "consultation" process will 
work once we have the IM.  Hence need to discuss with MTF, then Trustee and 
CRE asap ie in June if possible.  Preferably before we meet again with 
PWC/Roth....

In addition to Pierre's comments, the PIM also states that strike prices at 
least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be 
questioned.

? Capacity Release Phasing.  PIM confirms the 5 year period of the remdey but 
also says a review can be requested after 3 years.  Bruno - you need to 
review the remedy doc, but I do not see how a 2 year phasing of capacity 
release complies with the remedy (at least in spirit).  We would suggest 
there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase.  If 
theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to 
release unsold capacity on a 6 monthly or annual basis through the 5 year 
period.  The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity 
release and/or extract max value (can't blame them for trying but it is not 
what we want or what remedy requires).  EdF's only real argument is that 
phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity 
threshold drops in France.  However, since eligible demand already exceeds 
total capacity release this would limit development of competition to 
existing eligibles.  As a minimum the release programme for all capacity 
should be clearly defined up front; not at the whim of EdF.  Peter - thoughts 
on this and how, in context of remedy, we can argue for accelerated single 
phase auction (with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over 5 years)?
? Auction Process : qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM; but 
no obvious problems here.  I am less sure about nature of auction process.  
We obviously need to think it through more, but why not just have a simple 
process based on single sealed bids (or an electronic bid process).  The use 
of price "clock" controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be 
set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy - this should be set at 
zero for all product groups not subjectively "to ensure excess demand" but 
only for certain groups!
? Product Specs : need to understand what if anything can be changed here.  
Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval, but we need to understand 
what else can be influenced eg within day flex.  Since we have already 
covered this in previous submissions to MTF, EdF etc this should be easy to 
identify as we go forward.

Any comments?

Ross

Point 1.5: This info is of a preliminary nature and is subject to change. In 
addition, it is mentioned in point 6 that registered companies for the 
auction will have the opportunity to ask questions and raise issues during 
conferences, which will be then considered by EdF.

Specifications of the auction will be finalised by end August. This seems to 
leave some room for a complete feedback from registered companies. Let's 
discuss the content of the PIM.

I suggest to arrange anothe meeting with PWC/Rothschild in the next few weeks 
(week 11-16 June). 

What about a potential meeting with the Trustee about the PIM?

Bruno,

Quel surprise.  Should make your follow up with the MTF interesting as to the 
role of the Trustee.

One point to note for both MTF and Albers at COMP - the lack of within day 
flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting development 
of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand.  Suppliers will thus 
be at the mercy of EdF in the balancing market.

In addition, how on earth can they be allowed to take 2 years to complete the 
process?  How does that fit with merger remedy?

Somewhat ironic that they have the document in English!

Lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have spoken with MTF.

Regards,

Ross

Obviously a done deal - interestingly the Trustee is not mentioned. EDF has 
the capacity offering on its web page 
http://www.edf.fr/htm/en/enchere/enchere and has a detailed document in 
English but not in French yet. They also has EFET under industry links as 
well as the CRE, DIGEC. 

Attached is EDF's presentation of the product. After a quick look, it seems 
that flexibility is not a option (nomination at noon, and price has not 
changed)

31/05/01 UK: EDF ISSUES DETAILS OF ITS FIRST CAPACITY AUCTION.
LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - French utility Electricite de France (EdF) 
announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity 
production capacity to competitors. EdF was required by the EU Commission in 
February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for 
EU approval of its purchase of a 25 percent stake in German utility EnBW.
In the next two years, EdF will auction a total of 6,000 megawatts which 
include 1,000 MW of peak capacity sold at a price of 26 euros per megawatt 
hour (MWh) and 4,000 MW of baseload at a price of eight euros/MWh.
In addition, 1,000 MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made 
available. Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller 
producers under long-term contracts.
"With such contracts, electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have 
electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power 
plant," said EdF in a statement.
The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before 
the auction as it depends on gas price movements, EdF said.
The auction will take place in several tranches, the first one starting in 
September, when 200 MW of peak capacity will be auctioned, 800 MW of baseload 
and 190 MW of cogeneration.
The whole 6,000 MW should be sold by October 2003.
EdF, which has a 94 percent share of the French generation market, has a 
total installed capacity of 103,500 MW.

Rick,

This is the presentation and talking points Ken Lay will be using at the 
Repsol YPF Harvard Conference in Spain this Saturday.  He will be speaking 
for 50 minutes and then the floor will be open for discussion. He has been 
asked to talk about what to do after California.. how there is still a case 
for liberalization and the lessons for Europe.

 We are expecting comments from Europe regarding the talking points by 
tomorrow morning. But because Ken will need this tomorrow by noon, I did not 
want to wait until Europe's comments come back to show you this.  Please, let 
me know if you have any comments.



Regards,

Ursula Brenner

Expires After: 11/12/2001 23:00

HB 3633 (mo. delay) was concurred by the House with a 53 yes to 6 no vote!!  A
huge thanks goes to Rep. Jim Hill who helped us get our 5 mo. delay and has
been there for us through out the session.  This bill is now on its way to the
Gov. office for signature.  There is less than .0001% chance that the Gov
would veto this bill!  So were on!!!  

We are going to be in Senator Derfler's office first thing tomorrow  (Monday)
to see when HB 3696 will be scheduled.  We will make sure that the -13
amendments are not adopted and the -15 are adopted.  At this point were are
85% sure the -13's won't be, we plan on shoring that up in the morning!

Pollution Control Tax Credits SB 764 is up today at 4:00 PM for a hearing, so
far it looks like we will be fine if the Gov.'s office agrees to the latest
deal.  Our biggest issue are the Trojan credits and Kristina McNitt covers
this issue for PGE, she is less known as a PGE lobbyist than I am.-So far we
have been successful in keeping the T-word (Trojan) out of the building this
session. We are working closely with the other parties on PCTC vote counts and
individual lobbying but when the deal is being cut if PGE shows up there is
the possibility that the T word could tube a deal or attract some anti T
followers-so we have been very careful and low key on this issue.  We are very
optimistic about getting what we need even if it is at the eleventh hour!!

TRADE
Presidential Negotiating Authority A Must, Evans Says
Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping
up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority,
rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill
may not move this year and showing flexibility on the
controversial Jordan free trade agreement, which is backed by
some key Democrats. Presidential trade negotiating authority is
"number one on my list of issues [that] I am focusing on right
now," Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters.
Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the
bill could "slip" into next year. Evans and a senior
administration official also in on the session insisted that the
bill must pass this year. They indicated not only was the trade
negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with
Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, but passage
would help bolster U.S. credibility as it tries to launch a new
trade round.
Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to
the American people and that President Bush would be touting it
as well. Evans also said the point of this week's announcement
that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports
under section 201 of U.S. trade law was to see whether the steel
industry needed help, but he noted that if the move made
Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority,
then all the better.
The senior official indicated the administration was
considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions
that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental
provisions with sanctions. The bill is supported by some
Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues. Some business
officials oppose the deal; others are not taking a position. "I
think we are all coming around to the conclusion that ... one
size does not fit all," the official said. "There's a lot of
debate about whether Jordan's going to provide a way forward. I
think it's a model. I don't think it is necessarily the model."
But he added, "I think there's a number of different ways to
approach the problem, and Jordan's one of them." And he compared
Jordan's provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. - by Keith Koffler

TAXES
Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts
House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats
will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year
with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money, but echoed
Senate Majority Leader Daschle's comments Wednesday that there
would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on
the way this year. At a news conference criticizing the $1.35
trillion tax cut that became law today, Gephardt and other
Democratic leaders acknowledged that energy-related tax cuts and
renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just
some of the items Congress may need to address.
Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need
more money for FY02 appropriations bills, Gephardt said it will
be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional
spending or tax relief, but added: "We will have offsets. We hope
the Republicans will do the same." For now, he could offer no
specific ideas on what the offsets would be, but he left the door
open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of
funds. Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may
need to modify the 10-year bill President Bush signed today in
order to keep the budget balanced, but played down the notion
such revisions could happen as early as this year. Ways and Means
ranking member Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the real impact of
the tax cut is 10 years away, and claimed that [President]
"George W. is saying, 'Not on my watch.'"
The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a
letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas. Sources
said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering
trying to move a patients' rights bill quickly - even if it meant
having the bill go right to the floor. There may have also been
discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy-
related tax break measure. But Rangel and Ways and Means Health
Subcommittee ranking member Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., wrote
Thomas today "to express our strong opposition to such an effort,
and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and
rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena.? you
know, the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this
year on this important topic." Meanwhile, GOP leaders are
apparently eyeing a number of other priorities. House Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for
expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his
statement greeting Bush's signature of the tax cut bill. Majority
Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way, but
he acknowledged it could be modest. - by Stephen Norton

TAXES
Bush Signs $1.35 Trillion, 10-Year Tax Cut Measure
Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly
of elite Republican lawmakers, President Bush today signed into
law the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax relief package. The
legislation, which largely takes its cue from Bush's signature
campaign proposal, was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement
ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents
Kennedy and Reagan. Bush praised the role of some of the handful
of Democrats on hand - including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus
and Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia.
"Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in
Washington," Bush said. Calling this "an era of steady
cooperation," Bush predicted, "more achievements are ahead." But
few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the
new era. Among them were Sens. Max Cleland of Georgia, Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps. Ralph Hall of Texas, Ken Lucas
of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama. Republican leaders such as
House Speaker Hastert, Senate Minority Leader Lott, House
Majority Leader Armey, Senate Minority Whip Nickles, House
Majority Whip DeLay, House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and
Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were more
typical of those attending the bill-signing ceremony.
Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their
top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut, which
expires in a decade, permanent. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to
aggressively move the legislation as an amendment. "The first
thing we [have] got to do is make this [tax cut] permanent,"
Gramm told CongressDaily. "I intend to offer it at least a dozen
times." Nickles said Republicans will "be successful in either
extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for
estate taxes, I think," but he acknowledged, "It's going to be a
challenge." Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the
capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, to provide tax
breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to
buy health insurance, and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill.
Other tax cut vehicles, he said, could be the "Patients' Bill of
Rights" and the tax extenders bill. On managed care reform,
Nickles said, "there are some discussions going on, but I
wouldn't try to claim any optimism" about a deal. - by Keith
Koffler

HEALTH
Senate Readies For Debate On Patients' Rights Proposal
With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill,
behind-the-scenes discussions are picking up on what is expected
to be the chamber's next order of business - debate on a managed
care "Patients' Bill of Rights." HHS Secretary Thompson was on
Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and
GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose
differences have thus far proved unbridgeable. President Bush
earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to
bring to the floor - sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., and Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy. And Bush has
endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt. At the same time,
Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who helped write the McCain-Edwards-
Kennedy bill - but deferred sponsorship while he sought to
negotiate with the White House - is continuing his efforts, but
signaled he will not wait much longer. After one of his meetings
today, Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone. "We hope
we're able to reach an agreement," he said, but added that "if
the president feels strongly and this bill doesn't reach his
principles, he will" veto it.
Meanwhile, backers of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords approach said
new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the
final compromise. According to CBO, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords
bill would, when fully phased in, raise health insurance premiums
by an estimated 2.9 percent. That compares to 4.2 percent for the
McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and 2 percent for the GOP-sponsored
bill that passed the Senate in 1999. "Today's CBO report
illustrates what we've said all along, that our bill presents a
true compromise on the 'Patients' Bill of Rights,'" said Frist.
But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate.
Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure insist that the
president will sign virtually any patients' rights bill Congress
manages to pass. That prospect has frightened business and
insurance lobbyists, who vehemently oppose provisions that would
allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal
court. Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread
speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again
threatening to veto the bill, but also left what one source
called "wiggle room" if the Senate makes some, as yet undecided-
upon, changes.
While opponents of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure fear
they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the
measure - it appears to have virtually unanimous support among
Democrats - save Breaux - as well as at least a handful of
Republicans, including Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - opponents are more confident
about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax-
related health insurance "access" provisions. Some of those,
including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts, could be
controversial. - by Julie Rovner and April Fulton

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement
on a new organizational resolution for the Senate, although key
senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next
week. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he hoped negotiators would
be able to complete an agreement today. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-
N.M., said Republicans were "purifying" their own proposals to
decide how many points to include. Gramm and Domenici are part of
a five-member GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to
negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle. Daschle
said today negotiations were "going well," but declined to give
details. The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today.
But before any deal is final, Republicans will run any
agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference - a
requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry
Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until
mid-week. Republicans have backed down on their requirement that
any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential
nominations to the floor. Instead, said a GOP aide, negotiators
will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement, or
a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor. Democrats,
meanwhile, have given in to a GOP demand that committees be
expanded to reflect a one-seat Democratic advantage, rather than
bumping Republicans from panels. Said Commerce Chairman Hollings,
"I'm not comfortable with it, but that's what it's going to be."
Hollings' panel will grow to 23 members, a size he said will make
it hard to hold efficient hearings. "You get through opening
statements and, good God, the day is over," he said. - by Geoff

GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS
Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy, Environment
Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised
not to use his new chairmanship to "practice the politics of
personal attacks and destruction," but said he will investigate
the high cost of energy, as well as ask the Bush administration
to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards.
"The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply
in some parts of our country . will be the committee's immediate
priority," Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters.
Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the
deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a
June 20 hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable.
"From all that I have seen . I think FERC has the authority to
act and should have acted already," Lieberman said. A cosponsor
of price cap legislation proposed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-
Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., Lieberman said he would not
ordinarily favor price controls, but said the lack of competition
in the Western energy market warrants them.
Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration
officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards
regulating arsenic, forest roadbuilding and mining waste. "Who
did you talk to?" Lieberman asked rhetorically of the
administration's rapid rollback of federal policy long in the
making. He also said he would "put the breaks on any additional
plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards."
Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and said they would work together on
issues such as reducing government waste and abuse, electronic
government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal
personnel.
As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year's
disputed election, Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to
use his committee for political retribution. "The difference
between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder, but
you and I will know it once we see it," he said. When asked
specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President
Cheney's use of his official residence at the U.S. Naval
Observatory for a political event, Lieberman said definitively
no, but compared it to former President Clinton's White House
coffees. "It did make me laugh because the event and the
explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans
said" about the coffees, Lieberman said. - by Mark Wegner

ENVIRONMENT
Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy, Land Cuts
The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously
approved an $18.9 billion spending bill today that restores
President Bush's proposed cuts in energy research and increases
funding for energy conservation and land preservation
initiatives, National Journal News Service reported. The measure
provides $1.8 billion for energy programs, an increase of $294
million over the administration's request. The panel included
$311 million for weatherization and state energy grants, which is
an increase of $120 million over last year's level, and includes
$940 million for overall energy conservation. Calling the
restoration of energy conservation and research funding
"crucial," given the nation's electricity woes, subcommittee
ranking member Norman Dicks, D-Wash., hailed the panel's "very
bipartisan effort" and dedication to conservation spending. "This
is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a
bipartisan basis," he said.
In addition to the increased energy funding, the subcommittee
also agreed to provide $1.32 billion for the widely heralded land
conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the
controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act. Although
significantly smaller than CARA, the conservation initiative
nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a
variety of resource conservation programs. The bill increases
funding by $121 million over last year's level and $64 million
over the administration's request. The program includes $100
million for state wildlife grants, $45 million for wetlands
conservation, $47 million for historic preservation and $60
million in conservation incentives for private landowners.
House Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., said
the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the
Congress made to the compromise program last year when
appropriators balked at CARA's 15-year budget commitment to land
programs. "That should send a message to the administration that
they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it," Obey said.
Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee
to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday. - by Cyril

EDUCATION
GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict 'Straight A's' Initiative
Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category
of school funding from a trial program known as "Straight A's"
would gut a major component of the president's education bill.
The amendment to exempt 21st Century learning centers from the
"Straight A's" pilot program would remove almost half of the
available money and would discourage states from participating,
Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said. If the amendment passes, it would
"certainly be a blow to the bipartisan coalition that has worked
on this bill," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. The "Straight
A's" program was taken out of the bill on the House side, so
Frist said it was essential the provision stay in the Senate bill
when the bills go to conference. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
who is sponsoring the amendment, said he still plans to move
forward on it.
Meanwhile, the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today
after Republicans threatened a filibuster, delaying a potentially
explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of
whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools. The
amendment would require states to "achieve comparability of
education opportunities" among their schools, and was watered
down from earlier, more specific language. "This is not radical,
this is common sense," Dodd said during floor debate. Senate
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the
amendment does not interfere with the president's initiative and
encourages states to provide "additional focus and attention on
poor and underprivileged children." But Collins said it was an
"attempt by the federal government to set national standards." -

SCHEDULE
Senate To Work Through Amendments On Education Next Week
The Senate next week will work through amendments to the

Majority Leader Daschle said votes are expected Monday, and that
he intends to finish the bill by the end of the week. The House
will return next week Tuesday for a series of suspension votes
after 6 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House is scheduled to
take up the Sudan Peace Act and the SEC fees reduction bill,
although the latter bill has been postponed several times. No
House votes are expected Friday.

Jackson Meets With Lawmakers To Discuss Electoral Reform, Other
Issues
Rev. Jesse Jackson was on Capitol Hill today meeting with
Senate Majority Leader Daschle, and Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-
Conn., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to discuss electoral reform
and other issues, including judicial nominations. "I'm sure
hearings on electoral reform will begin this summer," Jackson
said, citing a report to be formally released by the Civil Rights
Commission Friday showing that minority voters in Florida were
overwhelmingly "disenfranchised." A draft of that proposed report
leaked out earlier this week, prompting criticism from
Republicans that it was inspired by partisanship. The commission
consists of four Democrats, three independents and one
Republican. Jackson said, "We must even the playing field for
certain voters." Jackson also said he was taking another trip to
South Africa to deal with the spread of AIDS in that country.

Stenholm Expects Mark Up Of Emergency Aid To Farmers Next Week

Stenholm also said the amount of aid for this year might be
higher than $5.5 billion in the FY02 budget resolution. That
money would come from a $79 billion, multi-year pool of funds
created to increase agricultural spending.

Daschle PAC To Hold Annual Gala
DASHPAC, the leadership PAC of newly minted Senate Majority
Leader Daschle, could not have picked a better time - fundraising
wise - to schedule its annual Washington bash than this evening.
Sources said the DASHPAC gala, which is being held at the 701

break the PAC's previous record. Tickets to tonight's gala are
going for $1,000 per individual, $5,000 per PAC or $10,000 for
corporate donors: the PAC has a $10,000 limit for contributors.
On K Street, lots of heavy lifting has been done by several blue

Poll Finds Smith, Shaheen Tied
A new American Research Group poll shows Sen. Bob Smith, R-
N.H., in a statistical tie with Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen,
but it also shows GOP Rep. John Sununu leading Shaheen by double
digits in a trial heat of the 2002 election. The poll, conducted
last Friday through Monday of 558 registered voters with a 4.26
point error margin, shows Smith leading Shaheen 42-41 percent,
with 17 percent undecided. But Sununu leads Shaheen 51-35
percent, with 14 percent undecided. Sununu has been contemplating
a challenge to Smith, who briefly left the Republican Party in
1999 during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, and the
Manchester Union-Leader reported today that many state
Republicans believe that Sununu has passed the point of no return
and will indeed challenge Smith in the GOP primary. However, a
recent invitation Sununu sent out for a June 10 fundraiser
headlined by former President Bush talks about a House re-
election campaign. In the letter, which refers to his 2000
Democratic challenger Martha Fuller Clark, Sununu wrote: "We had
a hard fought campaign last year. ... in less than six months
time, my opponent spent over $1 million ... already, she has
announced her candidacy for 2002. Our campaign next year will be
at least as tough, if not tougher." Sununu can transfer the money
to a Senate campaign if he decides to enter that race.

TRANSPORTATION
Airlines Offer More Voluntary Commitments To Improve Customer
Services
In an apparent effort to stave off potentially onerous
passengers' rights legislation, the airlines announced today they
are beefing up their voluntary commitments to improve customer
services and also are making those commitments legally
enforceable by including them in their customer contracts. House
Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and
Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman
John Mica, R-Fla., applauded the industry's latest commitment,
saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays.
Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay, Young
and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction
as a factor in air congestion and delay. Fairly narrow
passengers' rights legislation pending in the Senate would
strengthen the government's hand in holding the airline industry
to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a
vote in that chamber. Among the airlines' latest commitments, are
pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone
reservation system, to notify passengers of known delays,
cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers "essential
needs" during long on-aircraft delays.

AGRICULTURE
Veneman Defends Her Undersecretary Choice
Agriculture Secretary Veneman defended a nominee for a top
position at her department against allegations he was insensitive
to minorities and favored corporate farm interests, the
Associated Press reported. Veneman, speaking to reporters after a
ceremony honoring former Agriculture Secretary Glickman, called
Thomas Dorr, an Iowa farmer picked to be undersecretary for rural
development, a "visionary thinker." Dorr's nomination has been
criticized by groups representing minority farmers and small-
scale farming interests. At Iowa State University in 1999, Dorr
observed that an economically prosperous area of his state lacked
ethnic and religious diversity. He also has suggested the
creation of giant farming operations in which individual farmers
would work together. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not
scheduled a hearing on Dorr's nomination. Senate Agriculture
Chairman Harkin has not taken a position on Dorr. In a recent
letter to the committee, members of the Congressional Black
Caucus said they were shocked that a USDA nominee "would express
the belief that ethnic diversity is an impediment to economic
growth."

THE FINAL WORD
"We both have a clear understanding of important issues - like
endangered species. After all, he's a Democrat from Kansas and
I'm a Republican from California."

Attached for your review is the draft of Enron's response to the complaint of 
the National Association of Gas Consumers against "All Sellers of Natural Gas 
in the United States of America in Interstate Commerce".  The NAGC asks FERC 
to set a benchmark price for natural gas in the US of $2.74 with sales above 
that level being subject to refund for 3 years.

The deadline for filing is March 1.  If you have any comments on the draft, 
please respond by e-mail to both me and Leslie Lawner, or call one of us no 
later than 4:00 pm CST tomorrow.  My extension in Houston is 35840, and 
Leslie's phone number is 505-623-6778.

Lisa,

I have attached a one page summary.  I was waiting for Mark Taylor to review, 
but we don't have to wait. I spoke with him earlier and he is comfortable 
with my characterisation of the issues.

Rick, 

We are within 5% of SCE's negative CTC calculation up to January 17 (approx. 
$125 million).  However, as you can see from the attached chart, SCE would 
give us a $60 million-plus haircut with the methodology they are proposing 
for calculating negative CTC for post-Jan. 18.  Our protest to this 
methodology is due to be filed tomorrow, April 25.  I will call you to 
discuss the next step with SCE.

Subject: DA Account Balances

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.

Hertzberg/Edison Plan

A Fair Plan for California

Assembly Democratic Caucus

?

What the California public believes about the energy crisis:

?

Utilities are to blame.
Out-of-state generators have made huge profits.
We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand.
Deregulation is a failure.
The economy of the state is at risk.

?

What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis:

?

Re-regulation (restore balance to system).
Very small, if any, rate increases.
Reliability of supply (no more blackouts).
No permanent damage to environment, more emphasis on renewable sources.
Penalties for those who gouged the state.
Guarantee this won=01,t happen again.

?

Themes of the Fair Plan:

?

Federal role:? The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair &=20
reasonable rates.
Restore fairness:? Solutions must protect residential and small business=20
users.
Re-regulation:? Reassert our authority over California=01,s energy destiny.
Stability & Reliability:? Increase supply and keep a lid on rates.

?

?

Goals of the Fair Plan:

I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion 
late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with 
pro bono financial advice on the crisis.  Hertzberg is still hot on putting 
all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I 
agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south 
of 100% (if this thing gets legs).  Hertzberg asked for, and we provided 
today, a "fifth scenario," which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of 
core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.  Will 
report back with any further developments.

Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with 
this one.  That file accidentally had the same cents/kwh, noncore rate for 
both Edison and PG&E.  Edison's rate should be 12.98 cents/kwh NOT 12.21 
cents/kwh. It's the line that reads "Total cost to Noncore under CPUC's 
Recent Decision."

Best,
Jeff

We have confirmed that there is no current agenda item pending for the CPUC
to act on banning direct access.  Having said that, there are reports from
highly placed staff that an item to implement the AB-1X ban is being held in
Bilas' office, as he would like to see the legislative process run its
course, but there is a possibility that Lynch will reassign the matter to
another commissioner who opposes direct acess (Wood)in an effort to kill DA
before any other legislation is passed.  Please note:  The foregoing is
internal speculation/gossip from within the commission, and should not be
considered as confirmed.  Notwithstanding the controversy over implementing
AB 1X, Commissioner Brown has written a letter to Bowen endorsing direct
access and her bill, and publicly supported direct access in the Commission
meeting today.  That means 3 commissioners have voiced support for DA, and
only 2 opposed.  This again raises doubts over the accuracy of Bowen's
statement--which may have been designed to scare opponents into supporting
her bill.  We are attempting to get a copy of the letter sent by Brown and
will forward it to the lobbyists if we obtaining.  Stay tuned.  Mike Day

SBX2 27 (Bowen) passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on a
7-5 party-line vote.  In her closing, Senator Bowen said that if the
supporters of direct access do not want to help her with her bill she
would just as soon let if fail.  She also stated that the CPUC was going
to terminate direct access next week.  There was one additional
amendment taken which specifies that DWR must inform customers within 30
days of an inquiry what the projected exit fee will be.

Attached is a summary of the discussions at the meetings on June 19th.  I 
think that the meetings confirm that the key impediments to market opening 
are technical /systems readiness, concerns about pricing post-market opening 
, and Pickering A.   I will draft letters for Lay to Harris, Wilson  et al 
thanking them for the meetings and incorporating the data re Texas and 
Alberta that Lay and Lavorato used in the meetings.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece "Slow Starters" on page 24 discusses
the "entry tax" which is the capital burden for starting a new business.  It 
states that rich countries
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused
by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These "entry hurdles" 
and asscoiated costs
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the 
environment.

We might want to make the analogy of "entry tax" for new deregulated gas & 
power markets.  Things like
negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.
Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what 
they are going to get) and clearly slows
the new comers down.

I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

Edison International Details Lawsuits Against Company, Unit
Dow Jones Online News, Tuesday, April 10, 2001 at 11:17 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Edison International (EIX) detailed the lawsuits 
filed against the company and its Southern California Edison utility unit in 
a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On Monday, SoCal Edison and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) 
were sued in federal district court in Los Angeles by Inland Paperboard & 
Packaging Inc., a company that owns a cogeneration facility. The lawsuit 
seeks payment of $5.3 million for energy and capacity delivered to SoCal 
Edison under a qualifying facilities, or QF, contract from November 2000 
through March, plus additional and treble damages for alleged interference 
with Inland Paperboard's ability to sell power to third parties. 
Brea Power Partners L.P., a company that operates a landfill gas-fired plant, 
filed a lawsuit against SoCal Edison and Edison International on April 5 
seeking $1.65 million for energy and capacity delivered to SoCal Edison under 
a QF contract from November 2000 through March, plus $24 million of 
additional damages. 
On April 3, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by EF Oxnard Inc., 
the owner-operator of a cogeneration facility, seeking damages of at least 
$13.5 million for nonpayment by SoCal Edison for power deliveries under a QF 
contract from November 2000 through February. 
Also on April 3, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by four 
cogeneration companies affiliated with Delta Power LLC seeking damages of at 
least $42 million for nonpayment by SoCal Edison for power deliveries under 
four QF contracts from November 2000 through February. 
Watson Cogeneration Co., which operates a cogeneration facility, filed a 
lawsuit on March 29 against SoCal Edison seeking payment of damages of at 
least $150 million plus exemplary damages. 
On March 28, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by NP Cogen, the 
owner-operator of a cogeneration facility. The amount of damages sought isn't 
specified, but the complaint alleges that the amount owed by SoCal Edison is 
about $8 million. 
Also, IMC Chemicals Inc. is suing SoCal Edison for $2.8 million, a group of 
wind energy suppliers affiliated with FPL Group has filed a suit seeking 
"several million dollars," two geothermal energy suppliers affiliated with 
Caithness Corp. filed a lawsuit seeking more than $20 million, and a group of 
geothermal energy suppliers affiliated with CalEnergy Operating Co. filed a 
lawsuit seeking immediate payment of $100 million plus exemplary damages. 
According to Tuesday's SEC filing, several other owners or operators of 
qualifying facilities have given SoCal Edison letters demanding that the 
company pay them past-due amounts, requesting approval to sell their energy 
and capacity to third parties, and in some cases threatening legal action. 
As reported, Edison struck a deal with California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday, 
under which the state would purchase SoCal Edison's transmission system for 
$2.76 billion. The state also would make other financial arrangements that 
would allow the company to repay some $3.5 billion in accumulated power 
bills.

I met this morning with three officials from the US Consulate: Mitchell 
Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade 
Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade 
Specialist).                                     They expressed the view 
that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring 
in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications 
coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision 
to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two 
interests they identified were those of Enron and 
Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether 
there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our 
interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of 
proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only 
such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot  
market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this November 
and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour 
of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to the 
distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening; 
likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and 
proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG's 
announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could 
be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism 
pending full retail access.                                              I 
explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO 
tariff's "reciprocity" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances 
in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and 
agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with the 
gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale 
market opens this year.                                 I have committed to 
outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and 
providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be 
consistent with the "four guiding principles" enunciated by the Premier and 
Minister of Energy:  "protecting consumers and offering choice", creating a 
strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity", "protecting 
the environment", and "encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting 
the search for alternative sources of 
power".                                                                       
                                                                              
     We are meeting again on Thursday to discuss with the Consul General 
"Poncho" Huddle.   They are prepared to: a) get it included in Governor 
Pataki's  statements when he meets with Harris at a NY/Ontario  economic 
summit in Niagara Falls/Buffalo in late June, b) have the  new Ambassador 
include it in an early speech in Toronto, and speak to the Premier and 
others, and c) press the issue with their own contacts in Energy and Finance 
in 
Ontario.                                                                      
                                                                 Please give 
me a call if you have any questions.  I will develop the model with input 
from Paul and Garrett and Seabron Adamson/Kevin Wellenius.

This is an excerpt from the weekly newsletter of the Western power Trading 
Forum:


"California Attorney General Bill Lockyer made the major mud-slinging event 
of the
week.He said in Monday's WSJ,
"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp.Chairman Kenneth ] Lay to an 8 
x 10 cell
that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is 
Spike,honey,'"
I was depressed for two days after reading that.What is happening in this 
crazy place?
Elected officials are whipping up public fervor for a lynch mob?The statement 
was
beyond belief....

But here is a surprise that I didn't expect.Two days after the Lockyer quote 
was
published,Kathleen Connell called me,and expressed an apology for her 
"colleague's
statement regarding Enron.I want to distance myself,"she told me,"from that 
kind of
comment."We talked for about 15 minutes.I was stunned,and gratified by her 
remarks.
I asked if I could share her call with you folks,and she agreed."

The Commission approved the NYISO's AMP proposal for Summer 2001, expiring on 
October 31, 2001.  The Commission acknowledges problems with the proposal, 
such as  1) the AMP may mitigate bids when market power was not the cause of 
the high bid,  and 2) generators will not have a chance to explain their bids 
prior to mitigation.  Nevertheless, FERC still approves the proposal, 
justifying its actions by saying that the proposal is only temporary.

The Commission notes that, while it prefers more limited automatic mitigation 
procedures (where market power mitigation is tied to structural market power 
problems), it will accept the NY proposal for this summer because NY is 
concerned that supplies will be tight and demand response may not be 
effective.

A copy of  the order is attached.  Please let us know if you have any 
questions.

Sarah

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: June 6, 2001

RE: Revised EPSA Draft Paper on Assuring Adequate
      Capacity in a Competitive Market
      ?Conference Call on Friday, June 8th at 11:00 a.m. (EDT)

On May 29th EPSA circulated a draft position on the issues raised during our 
earlier meeting on assuring adequate capacity in a competitive market.  We 
invited comments on that draft and promised to circulate a revised draft in 
advance of conference call scheduled on Friday, June 8th to discuss this 
issue further.

Attached are two documents.  One is an extensively red-lined version of the 
May 29th draft based on comments forwarded from several members.  Where 
possible, we have incorporated suggested changes and identified, with 
brackets ([ ]), alternative proposals or issues needing further discussion.  
Also attached is an alternative set of bullets drafted by Jeff Roark at 
Mirant suggesting an another way to organize the points.  Thank you all for 
your time and effort on this project.

Please review both documents in preparation for Friday's call, which will be 
held at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the conference call, dial 1-800-937-6563 
and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions or concerns 
in advance of the call, please contact Julie at 202-628-8200.

An interesting article too:

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex."

Ken Lay met with the Vice President last week for about 45 minutes to discuss 
the Administration's National Energy Policy.  During the discussion, Ken 
raised the importance of including LNG in its policy.  Ken emphasized that 
any national energy policy should encourage investment in infrastructure for 
natural gas and power, and said that at current gas prices in the US LNG 
imports are financially attractive.  Ken said that Enron is making a 
significant investment in global LNG business and much of this investment 
will be in the US and South America.  The Vice President, while not affirming 
our position, seem very receptive to the message.  As we were departing the 
White House, Ken saw Secretary Colin Powell.  Ken spoke to the Secretary 
about our LNG project and gave our LNG briefing paper to the Secretary.  We 
also followed up his discussion with a letter from Ken to Secretary Powell, 
thanking the Secretary for looking into the Venezuelan LNG project.

Michael Albers, Head of unit for Energy in DG Competition gave a talk on 
competition priorities in Brussels yesterday.

Highlights:

Priorities for DG Comp are:  1) foster supply competition; for examlpe, new 
candidate for DG Comp's help has been identified in Belgium and it would be 
necesary to intervene to help this new competitor. In merger control, 
emphasis will be on supply solutions and not transmission market issues. 2) 
Crossborder Network Access: proceedings will be initiated after the summer 
re. French/Spanish and Dutch/Belgian borders. General policy will be spelt 
out in an Art. 19(3) notice on Viking Cable. [If we want to influence general 
policy we should make a submission on this before it appears: an Art 19(3) 
notice is a Commission Decision and constitutes a binding legal precedent. 
Although comments on Viking Cable can be made after the event, we would not 
be in a position to influence the policy published in the Notice. BD to 
follow up.] 3) Eligible customers should be able to choose their suppliers: 
most cases are resolved informally. 4) State Aid especially stranded costs; 
also environmental policy notice will have impact in this area (Nailia:please 
follow up.)

Specific cases:

On UK Gas Interconnector: no news.

Long term Agreements (gas and electricity): "dominant firms cannot have 
exclusivity caluses, and long-term contracts as such may be a problem".

SNAM/GAZPROM contracts: destination clauses are illegal, Commission to 
initiate proceedings after the Summer break; there will be no blue lining, 
meaning that in a contract where a clause is illegal, the Commission will 
press for the contract to be terminated, and not allow the contract to 
continue intact but the offending article 'blue lined' out. [This suggests we 
ought to offer some thoughts on draft model long term contracts.BD to follow 
up.]  Applicable mutatis mutandisto GFU contracts.

A gas case that will specify the limits of gas TPA regimes will be "heard 
more of after the summer break". (Access to Pipelines Case, TPA ex.-Emden, is 
my guess.)

Gas Release Programmes: no indication that this was an emerging issue: Albers 
offered no views.

Art 86(3) Directive -- cannot achieve what one can with an Art 95 Directive 
(I will write a separate explanation of this -- basically an Art 86(3) 
Directive cannot force regulatory structures on countries, i.e. a regulator, 
but can change a company's behaviour, i.e. account unbundling.)


Any views welcome

Brendan

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20

report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20

relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=

Maureen,

I've checked Linda Robertson's call sheet from January 2001 and do not find 
any record of incoming calls from Commissioner Hebert to Linda.
Nonetheless, she may have initiated a call TO him.

I'ved tried to reach Linda on her cell phone -- no success.  Perhaps Rick 
could raise this question with Linda when he joins her on the 11:00 AM (CDT) 
conference call today?

I'm also checking with Sarah Novosel and Joe Hartsoe -- both of whom are out 
at meetings at the present time.  When I get any responses I'll let you know.
Thanks for holding down the fort!

Lora

Steve --

In a discussion today with Mike, Kelly, etc., it was apparent that the Public 
Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously.  Given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political 
fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans.  My primary worry is that 
P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction.

I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs 
coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. 

Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

Jim

Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with 
Glynn:

Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on

Rick - Here is a final copy of the NJN LOI  that was executed ie fuel cells.  
I'm excited about this because although NJN is a smaller LDC , this deal was 
cut at the highest levels (Pres/CFO) of their organization and has solidified 
an already solid regulatory relationship.  Larry Downes has all but assured 
me that  the gas asset deal is next!   Hope all is well.  See u Thursday.

Here is what I have been able to do on the list of accomplishments.  Tim 
Belden said it was impossible to quantify what we had done for the western 
market on a P/L basis for ENA, but that it was very important for creating a 
good market going forward. Nonetheless, he gave me a number (I thought a 
pretty low one)  based on what it would mean for his own P/L. I'm waiting to 
hear something back on one other item from EES.  Basically, most of it is 
pretty impossible to quantify.

John and I met with the group headed up by NERC that supports reliability 
legislation.  Included in the group are:  NERC, CEA, EEI, APPA, TAPS, ELCON, 
EPSA, PJM, Entergy.  The group is attempting to reconvene and indicate their 
continuing support for the reliability legislation (33 pages) that was 
drafted last year.  Enron, ELCON and EPSA did not support the final drafted 
legislation, although we are told that Enron (through Dan Watkiss) was close 
to giving its support.

This group still supports the legislation that was drafted last year and 
would like Enron to give its support as well.  ELCON has many concerns with 
the legislation, and EPSA is still on the fence (waiting to hear from us, I 
think).   John Shelk and I indicated to the group that Enron is reassessing 
the legislation and our position on the legislation.  Another meeting 
(conference call) is scheduled for June 15.   Enron seems to be somewhat of a 
linchpin in this debate -- the group thinks the legislation will be effective 
if Enron signs on, even without ELCON's support, but they seem to think it 
has less effectiveness without Enron.  Therefore, the group is very anxious 
to hear our position.

John and I are meeting with Dan Watkiss tomorrow to find out from him where 
we left off on the drafting.   We want to see how comfortable Dan was with 
the draft legislation and where he felt that changes were still needed.  We 
are then meeting with ELCON on Thursday to get a better idea of what their 
concerns are with the legislation (it seems to be a pretty long list).  I 
will send an email to this group on Friday letting everyone know what came 
out of these meetings and we can then discuss what position Enron should take 
in this group effort.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was 
good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional 
ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. 
If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I 
could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance 
notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this 
new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to 
where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.

I had a conference call with Michael Guerriero, Juli?n Poole and Andrea Calo 
regarding the information Enron must submit to ACEERA, the power marketers 
association, next Monday morning, to be included in ACEERA's presentation to 
the Secretariat of Energy.
I will make the first draft of the information we will submit next Monday 
morning, that will cover points 9 to 13 below. My draft must be ready 
tomorrow afternoon.
In order to do it, I will apreciate if you could give material to support the 
following main guidelines (in blue) we would follow.
The material could include papers, letters, documents, and international 
examples I could mention, explaining the benefits of following these criteria 
and how should they be implemented.

9. Criteria for the treatment of Marketers' activities.
They are not a public service
Marketers should daily declare their offered prices (as gencos) for their 
forcasted firm supply to be included in the determination of daily dispatch 
and spot prices. This could reduce the supply concentration.
Warranties required to Marketers. All players in the spot market should 
present similar warranties.
Right to interrupt the service for customer default. How can this be 
implemented?
It should be allowed to act as both marketers or brokers.

10. Criteria for the treatment of large users.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market

11. Criteria for the treatment of supply contracts.

12.  Criteria for transferring to end users market prices.
Possibility to include in the pass through the cost of hedging products. Did 
we get this approved anywhere in USA? Where? How is the pass through done 
(procedure)?
Full unbundling is better than pass through, since prices can be determined 
by supply and demand

13.  Criteria for  functioning of the forward market.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market
Elimination of minimum terms and volumes in this market
Free prices and conditions
Forward market contracts do not require former aproval to be executed. 
Only LDC's contracts to be included in the pass through to rates should be 
subject to regulation.

And any other point you consider relevant to make related to these subjects

I will appreciate any information you could give me as soon as possible.
Regards
GC

Colleagues:

After a discussion with Michael and Julian, they see that it is more 
effective to concentrate our efforts on providing comments (and language if 
possible) to the points highlighted in Red below.  They also agreed in 
interpreting the term "Criteria" as "Is the suggested language in the 
reglemento is in favour of our generation and marketing activity? If not what 
is the suggested alternative".  

He shall contact you shortly to confirm this message and agree on the time 
framework which is likely be this coming Monday.

Please let me know if you have any question taking into consideration that I 
can provide examples from CA systems.

O'Day and myself over the next week to discuss regulatory issues in Japan and 
our plan for a competitive Japanese market, please find attached the latest

Rick, Jim and Steve:

Please find attached a revise doutline for the policy paper on RTO
development.

A few things to note (to make sure you are truly OK with it):

- the "base model" described will basically be a "PJM Light" with
energy-only bids. This will involve a centralized unit commitment process
(based on a constrained optimization) and financial transmission rights. All
other items on the "wish list" will be treated as future potential
developments.

- there will a substantial section on market power issues and RTO
development.

- there will a section on the relationship between wholesale and retail
market development. The main idea is that a "wholesale only" market without
price signals sent to customers is not going to be viable.

- the main conclusion section will center on a "100 days" (not literally 100
days) set of policy proposals for getting workable markets established
across the country ASAP.

Comments welcome.

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan. ?See
Section 5 - A Japanese Pool. ?They make several good arguments as to why a
mandatory pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for
Japanese liberalization. ? Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US
policy arguments.

First of all, we did not have any advanced notice of the appeal to the ERCO=
T=20
Board.  Mark Walker from ERCOT called me regarding their application and to=
ld=20
me that it would probably be denied and at that point nobody, I doubt, knew=
=20
that TNPC would appeal.    The rules appear to be cut and dry.  Basically,=
=20
for them to have a full corporate membership Enron would have to own less=
=20
than 5% to avoid the common ownership criteria for EPMI.

I spoke to Marianne after the Board Meeting.  She felt uncomfortable when I=
=20
told her the I was upset because I did not know about the appeal and that t=
he=20
way that the appeal was handled at the board.  Short answer is that Mariann=
e=20
did not feel at liberty to tell us about the appeal for whatever reason.

It appears that we will be the only representation that TNPC will have for=
=20
their REP.  I will bridge the gap with Susan Burton in the Austin office to=
=20
try and help them with their issues.  One problem is that in her attempts t=

 her=20
part to be forth coming with their issues.  I have spoken to others at TNPC=

Subject: ERCOT Board Meeting

The ERCOT Board met yesterday in Austin to discuss among other things the=
=20
implementation of the Texas Choice Pilot and the single control area under=
=20
the control of the ERCOT ISO.  Below are the primary items of interest.

1.   ERCOT proposed the following plan to implement the Pilot program and t=
he=20
wholesale:

May 25, 2001

ERCOT begins to transfer security analysis to the ESCA system
Participants able to start viewing network conditions, preliminary load=20
forecasts, preliminary A/S market requirement analysis, and retail load=20
profiles
ERCOT begins to manage and publish participant information and process=20
customer service requests

June 1, 2001

ERCOT initiates switch processing from competitive retailers starting with=
=20
small volumes and to be completed by July 1, 2001 (this is only the switch=
=20
request, power does not "flow" from the REP until the billing cycle after=
=20
July 6, 2001).
ERCOT begins to process retail meter read information.
Participants begin to enter outages in ERCOT systems (this will be parallel=
=20
to current outage system entry).
ERCOT will begin to publish distribution and transmission loss factors to t=
he=20
market.

June 8, 2001

ERCOT Begins to complete data aggregation functions and initiates UFE=20
calculations/analysis.
ERCOT's A/S market requirements and QSE obligation Calculations are ready f=
or=20
sing control area operations
ERCOT begins to execute the production settlement algorithms.  The settleme=
nt=20
results are not binding.
ERCOT begins to transfer grid security decisions to the new systems
Data aggregation allows initial calculations of UFE to be made visible to t=
he=20
market providing energy accounting information

July 6, 2001

Frequency Control.  ERCOT begins single control area operation and=20
controlling frequency.  The existing control area replaced with the single=
=20
control area run by ERCOT.
Wholesale Markets.  ERCOT administers the regulation, balancing energy, and=
=20
reserve markets.  ERCOT starts clearing prices as part of single control ar=
ea=20
operations.  The wholesale competitive market, as defined by the protocols =
is=20
initiated with ERCOT settling A/S markets centrally.
ERCOT begins to execute financial transfer processes as a result of binding=
=20
settlement with participants
QSEs must have completed qualification activities


While the proposal satisfies many of the competing concerns of the=20
Stakeholders and the PUCT, there are a few outstanding issues that remain.

ERCOT will begin switching load transfer requests on June 1 2001, but actua=
l=20
settlement and energy flow will not occur until after the wholesale market=
=20
opens on July 6, 2001.  Enron has submitted a proposal that would allow the=
=20
retail market to decouple from the wholesale market which would allow the=
=20
wholesale market time to remedy the system limitations and the retail marke=
t=20
could begin June 1, 2001.  Under the ERCOT timeline if the wholesale market=
=20
is not ready by July 6, 2001 and the switch requests have already begun, th=
en=20
there is no method to serve a customer full requirements without the abilit=
y=20
of the REP to purchase balancing energy and other A/S other than purchasing=
=20
under current tariff.  I can provide a copy of the Enron proposal to those=
=20
who are interested.

Another concern is for reliability of the system.  Some parties question th=
e=20
wisdom of opening the wholesale market in the middle of the summer peak,=20
rather than waiting until the summer peak has passed.

 =20
2. Credit Standards.  The Board also voted on language for the surety bonds=
. =20
There has been a debate as to whether ERCOT should allow security bonds in=
=20
light of what has happened in California and the surety bond that was=20
underwritten by AIG.  At this point, the PUCT order requires ERCOT to accep=
t=20
a surety bond, however, ERCOT is trying to tighten the payment language.  T=
he=20
language that the board approved will be forwarded when I get the correct=
=20
language.  The board approved the addition of BBB- credit to the credit lim=
it=20
matrix.


3. New Power Company made an unsuccessful appeal for corporate membership. =
=20
New Power argued that they were technically not an affiliate of EPMI who=20
holds the Corporate Membership.  EES for example has associate member=20
status.    It was pointed out by ERCOT that EPMI listed New Power as a=20
corporate affiliate on their application for corporate membership.  Mariann=
e=20
Carroll, represented New Power in the appeal, and stated that EPMI did not=
=20
ask her advice prior to listing New Power as affiliate.  An additional=20
rationale cited by New Power was that in the future Reliant Energy wants to=
=20
"spin off" their generation company and that when they do, they should be=
=20
allowed a Corporate membership as well.  I am concerned about the appearanc=
e=20
of the appeal by New Power, it looked like an attempt by Enron to sway the=
=20
process in "their" favor by getting additional votes on ERCOT issues.

Friday.

******************************************************************************
*********************************************
Basics of Proposal
Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for 
the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component
Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market 
structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
contracts)
Concessions
 -IOUs (MOU modifications)
 -Generators (past due amounts)
 -investigations
Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
securitization)

Message
This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement
We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that 
will see us.
We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with 
our proposal
We intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution---it's 
vital, and time's running out

Media Strategy---Karen Denne

Corporate leader strategy---Karen Denne

Jim suggested  I provide you   a  brief  heads up  on a project underway for  
the  Enron Networks  group for  developing  a suite of products  called  
Commodity Logic.  Jim Whitehead  is the lead on the project  and  reports to 
Tom Gros.

I am preparing a Competitor Analysis of  135  B2B firms  that  offer already  
or are developing products  that compete with the  Commodity Logic  software  
products.  Our plan is to force  rank them  within  the  four product  
categories in development  by  Enron under the   Commodity Logic  brand.  We 
will analyze the competitors as possible sources of M&A opportunities and  of 
course, tracking the competitors customers gives us  possible  targets for  
the Commodity Logic  software. These products are initially  for the energy 
commodity business  but  are scalable and  for the future  envisioned to be 
applicable to many other commodities.
 The  attached mini-profile  describes  the 4 current  products.  Let me know 
if you have any questions  or need  any more information.

Today's Washington Post reports on an interview with FERC commissioners Wood 
and Massey following yesterday's hearing before the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee.  According to the Post, each commissioner said they are 
prepared to make "heavy refunds" because of overcharging in California.  They 
each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the 
upcoming settlement conference first.  The Post article (which was on the 
front page of the business section, perhaps an indication of the somewhat 
diminished press coverage of the issue) mentioned Enron in a list of 
companies "facing allegations of overcharges."

There are also news reports that Gov. Davis met with commissioners Wood and 
Brownell while he was in town.  The same reports say that Gov. Davis will 
meet with commissioner Wood in California on  Monday.

EDF Pursues Italy's Montedison; 
Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor  

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]Power giant Electricit,de France (EDF) has sent shock waves through 
Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise 
its stake in electric firm Montedison to 20 percent from about 6 percent. 
However, Romano Prodi, the European Union commissioner for competition, is 
considering an intervention in the battle between EDF, the French electricity 
monopoly, and the Italian government. The latter has passed an ad hoc law 
restricting EDF to 2 percent of the voting rights for Montedison, the Italian 
electricity supplier spun off by Enel.  

Analysis: Once again, the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the 
European power market, with EDF playing the staring role. For the last year 
or so, as the European Union (EU) has enacted electric competition across the 
Continent, France's EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in 
other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by 
foreign suppliers. Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through 
its ownership of London Electricity, the French power firm has wanted for 
some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy. However, the 
neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France 
reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market. 

As I have mentioned before in this column, France has been criticized by 
other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country. 
As a result, EDF (which controls approximately 90 percent of the French 
electric industry) may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad 
until it further opens its own market to competition. To date, France has 
only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the 
EU, and EDF has played a large role in this resistance. While other European 
countries such as Germany have opened 100 percent of their markets to 
competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third each 
of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008, respectively. 
Thus, although other companies such as Spain's Endesa have attempted to push 
through barriers to obtain entry into France, it is questionable when true 
competition will emerge in the country.  

Nevertheless, EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its 
holdings in Montedison, one of Italy's main electricity companies. Reports 
are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison. EDF recently said 
that its stake increased from 3.971 percent to 5.971 percent. However, other 
reports have indicated that EDF already controls about 20 percent of the 
capital assets of Montedison. Both increases in Montedison were made 
recently, which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market 
regulatory Consob. EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made 
strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the company's financial 
assets across Europe. However, at the same time, EDF has also indicated that 
any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading 
purposes. In other words, EDF wants to control the generating assets of 
Montedison for resale across Europe's wholesale market. Further, with a 
20-percent stake, EDF would become Montedison's largest shareholder and a 
major presence in Italy's power market even as France remains mostly closed.  

EDF's argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial 
diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian 
government. The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a 
strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many 
additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators. In fact, EDF has 
admitted that its strategy is to "make 50 percent of its turnover from 
activities abroad by the end of 2005, compared with 25 percent currently." 
Consequently, it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its 
home country for expansion opportunities, and these opportunities typically 
have been in distribution and generation assets. Moving forward, the company 
has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation 

For instance, last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for 
the regional U.K. electricity company Seeboard, which is owned by American 
Electric Power (NYSE: AEP). Serving about two million connected customers in 
England, Seeboard owns, operates and maintains an electricity network of over 
45,000 km (28,000 miles) of overhead lines and underground cables. An 
acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDF's overall expansion efforts in 
Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity, one of 12 regional 
electricity companies in England and Wales, which EDF bought from Entergy in 
1998. In addition, EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden (Graninge) and 
Germany (EnBW) and reportedly is Poland's largest electricity distributor. 
These acquisitions were made by EDF International, which is wholly owned by 
the French government, and thus subject to EU oversight. Perhaps due to EDF's 
size and presence in Europe, these previous acquisitions were allowed without 
a great deal of EU intervention. However, now that other countries have 
voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede, it is 
unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny.  

As noted, trading appears to be the next wave of EDF's expansion efforts. 
Toward this end, EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in 1999 to create an energy 
trading company called EDF Trading. The various companies that EDF has 
invested in across Europe support the company's efforts to both learn about 
new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens 
fully across the Continent.  

For its part, the Italian government has responded that it will block any 
increase of EDF's ownership of Montedison, based primarily on the argument 
that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France. 
Specifically, Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting 
rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison. Further outlining 
its position, the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the 
imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be 
sold by Enel, one of the country's main power firms. As Montedison will be 
one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel, the Italian 
government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and 
thus having access to additional power assets in Italy. For instance, Enel is 
planning to sell Elettrogen, a generation company that produces about 15 
percent of the production capacity in Italy. If EDF were to increase its 
stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen, 
then EDF, as a foreign entity, would gain a lock over the Italian power 
supply market.  

Italy's anti-EDF law is an interesting development, but it does not mark the 
first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent. Spain 
also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with 
regard to the French company's pursuit of Hidrocantabrico, Spain's fourth 
largest supplier. However, despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict 
any expansion of EDF, the laws, although they are already in place, may 
ultimately be deemed anti-competitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome, 
which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU. 
Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates anti-trust 
allegations in the United States, any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain 
and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles. 

EDF also remains interested in the Spanish's largest power utility Endesa, 
which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the 
French electricity market (through a 30-percent acquisition of French 
electricity generator Soci&eacutet,Nationale d&#39Electricit,et de 
Thermique). Endesa, which recently terminated an attempted merger with 
Iberdrola, Spain's second largest power firm, has been viewed as a takeover 
target for larger companies such as EDF. 

At last report, the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to 
intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on "how far 
control was being exercised." In other words, EU intervention will be based 
on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an 
increased stake in Montedison. The fact that France remains resistant to 
electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate, 
and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the 
governments of Italy and Spain.

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more 
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group 
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has 
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of 
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private 
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to 
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the 
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per 
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & 
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour 
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 
an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for 
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and 
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. 
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, 
according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased 
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more 
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest 
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have 
reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. 
"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the 
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% 
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging 
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting 
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on 
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's 
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first 
quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the 
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's 
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited 
to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the 
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. 
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since 
his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in 
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to 
$271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded 
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one 
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per 
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a 
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a 
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average 
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of 
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be 
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, 
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered 
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see 
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached 
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing 
the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, 
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas 
prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, 
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems 
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state 
projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June 
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under 
$100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited 
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term 
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry 
closer to normalcy."

The plan reforecast we went through after Q1 resulted in a reduced expense 
base of $28m for the year.  This is still short of our target of $50m to 
$100m.  As you are aware we reforecast our expenses on a quarterly basis and 
for Q2 I want you to work with your management accountant to produce the 
below pack by June 30th.  Management accounting will critic the packs and 
provide a detailed analysis of overs and unders to the Office of the Chair.  
If necessary meetings will be held with you and the Office of the Chair to go 
through your numbers in detail.  If you have any questions about the below 
please contact Stephen Wood or your management accountant who should be 
contacting you shortly to discuss.

Colleagues:

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the 
largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure.  I am confident of 
your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this 
ambitious schedule on time  (the process will start on April 23rd and 
conclude by May 25th, 2001).

Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs 
required from you  in a faster, and more cost-effective manner.  We are also 
working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user 
friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the 
intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the 
required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the 
time comes (it is the second stage of the process).   

Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this 
coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your 
comments and suggestions.  

Best regards

Jim, Scott:

Please find below the production schedule to update and review the regulatory 
component of the largest 50 curves (75% of net positions).  The process will 
start on April 23rd and conclude by May 25th, 2001.  The Team here is  
working very closely with Jeff and Rick to systemize the process so that we 
put the right foot forward, always, and repetitively  (90 days intervals); I 
certainly appreciate their insight, and advice.

Please let me know if you have any question, comment, or suggestion.

Beyond the two excellent editorials in today's WSJ (attached) the following 
should be the key messages:

1.  The show was an aimless wander through the well-worn territory of 
blame-game politics, with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in.

2.  It should not surprise anyone that two Berkley-based journalists, working 
in conjunction with the New York Times, would ignore Econ 101 and suggest 
that the solution for California's energy crisis is to subject the entire 
nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations.  Such pinings have been 
abandoned over the past 65 years, but if the New York Times wants to stake 
out that position ... fine.  It will probably help sharpen the debate and set 
up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices 
moderate.  (Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New 
Deal regulations.)

3.  The show completely ignored the failings of California's political and 
regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had 
a chance.

4.  Of the electricity consumed in California, less than 15 percent is 
generated by companies headquartered in Texas.  More than 50 percent of the 
electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been 
charging the same high prices as the Texas "pirates."  These good pirates 
include the Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, the Government of British Columbia, and the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District.




Business World: California's Ship of Fools
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A27
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lamenting the politician's lot in "Profiles in Courage," John F. Kennedy 
wrote that "In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice 
honors, prestige and his chosen career on a single issue." Of course, no 
politician would last long if he didn't blow with the wind nine times out of 
10. But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some 
courage. 
We don't know what happens when an advanced economy like California's suffers 
day after day of blackouts. We may be about to find out. Modern office 
architecture becomes uninhabitable without air-conditioning and elevators. 
Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat. So may drivers at unlit 
traffic crossings.
Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts, but voters wouldn't know 
the difference, and it's so much easier to cast blame. Gov. Gray Davis prates 
about a "war with Texas." And who knows what secret failures as a human being 
led Bill Lockyer, the attorney general, to threaten Enron's Ken Lay with 
homosexual rape in the California prison system. 
California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of 
crisis. Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Davis harp on price, but the true problem is the 
unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the 
current structure of retail rates. 
Both must know the solution they noisily advocate, federal price controls 
slapped across Western electricity markets, wouldn't bring power into 
existence to close the gap. Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with 
the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from California's mistakes across 
half a dozen other states. 
In California itself, municipal utilities in Santa Clara, Palo Alto and other 
towns have already announced they won't participate in rolling blackouts. The 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isn't volunteering. Why 
should voters in other states? Why not just cut the lines and let California 
monopolize the darkness? A state review board in Washington has already 
vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined 
for California. 
Mr. Davis knows this; he knows price controls would create a new problem 
without solving the shortages. Meanwhile, the specter nobody wants to talk 
about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues 
to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded 
from the true cost of power. 
Mr. Davis's version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame. Texas companies 
account for just 12% of California's supply, having bought 7,000 of the 
20,000 megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under 
"deregulation." Being in the right place at the right time has always been 
profitable, but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas, 
pipeline capacity, storage and ancillary services. Take Enron: Its revenues 
quadrupled in the past year, but so did its costs, and profits are up only 
31%. 
A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest "gougers" BC Hydro, 
owned by Canadian taxpayers, and the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration. 
Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local 
needs with spot-market power, so they could sell their own production for 
higher prices to California during the day. 
These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed 
across the West, making the shortages worse, probably much worse. 
Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro they've 
been passing on to California -- 3,000 megawatts, enough for two million 
homes. Farmers could resume irrigating. Seattle, Tacoma, Boise and other 
neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do, hiking rates to 
curb demand. 
Rather than emulate them, Gov. Davis's peacock of an energy czar, David 
Freeman, babbles about "public power," the answer to a question nobody asked, 
the solution to a nonexistent problem. 
Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling 
as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the state's 
future needs. Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr. Freeman's antique 
New Deal schemes. What's been missing while folks like him ride their hobby 
horses, though, is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the 
suffering this summer. 
One large source of untapped power is California's own small generators, 
known as qualifying facilities. Their fee scale is set by the state, but 
California couldn't even summon the political competence to keep them in 
business, so 3,000 megawatts sit idle. 
People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the 
California mess, but we wouldn't be here if water flows in the Columbia River 
system weren't down 54% from normal. Last summer, California's fossil-fuel 
generators increased their output by a whopping 62% to make up the shortfall, 
mostly by running existing plants harder. 
Yes, there have been flaky prices, partly because, mysteriously, California 
continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its 
power one hour in advance. But the flaky prices also represent a system 
pulling out all stops to save California from itself. 
We said back in December there's only one solution: Jack up rates to stop 
consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg, borrow or steal. 
The only question was when Gov. Davis would find the courage. Hard to 
believe, but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on 
the drawing board and busily being watered down. 
Someone should point out to Gov. Davis that the author of "Profiles in 
Courage" wasn't endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must 
husband their leadership for times when it really counts. Not a few people in 
public life understand this. Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could 
justify the compromises and trimming he's done in his life. But Mr. Davis is 
perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to 
have a political career. 
What borders on the stupefying, though, is the failure of any other 
Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power 
crisis. By all rights Gov. Davis should be a political leper, yet he actually 
stands a microscopic chance of being re-elected because of the sheer poverty, 
in a state of 34 million people, of the Republican opposition. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
California Squeaks By

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A26
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray 
Davis has done nothing but squeak at it. At first, he attacked out-of-state 
power generators for being pirates and marauders. But lately he has focused 
on FERC and President Bush, demanding that the federal government place price 
caps on the sale of wholesale power. He's even rustled up 10 economists -- 
including the dad of deregulation, Alfred Kahn -- to support him. 
Well, as most everybody knows -- including the economists who have come out 
in favor of them -- price caps don't work. If caps are set too low, (as 
politics often dictate), existing supply will shrink and demand will grow, 
making the situation worse. Even "correctly" set price caps will discourage 
additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand. The usual result is an 
aggravation of shortages and rationing. Indeed, the history of price caps, 
particularly during the energy crisis in the early 1970s -- when oil prices 
were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long -- bears this out.
The pro-price-caps argument however is a clever one. It rests on the notion 
that there is no "effective competition" in the California energy market. 
According to one of the 10 pro-price-cap economists, Paul Joskow at MIT, the 
energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very, 
very tight supplies, which conspire to produce, at certain times, prices 
above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions. 
Mr. Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of 2000, 
looking at market fundamentals (the broad forces determining supply and 
demand); he found that 25% to 30% of the wholesale prices of electricity 
during June, July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and 
should be attributed to market imperfections. 
As an argument for price caps, this is hardly overwhelming. Especially since 
there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no 
further than market fundamentals. Such as the fact that the price of the most 
important input for almost half the electricity generated in California, 
natural gas, has been rising over the past year. Such as the fact that 
natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity, thus bidding up the price to 
transmit. Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in 60 
years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market, putting 
even more demands on natural gas generation. Such as the fact that imports 
into the state, which were running 20% and up to 25% during peak usage, have 
declined. And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions 
-- which must be held by plants generating electricity -- has skyrocketed. 
Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years, 
unfettered by rate increases, has zoomed dramatically. 
At any rate, electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country; 
indeed, California's neighbors, the states of Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, 
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Montana, have had to bump up utility rates 
30% to 50%. So where is the tablet of stone saying that California, with its 
especially restrictive environmental regulations, should be any different? 
The bad news for California is that, poor dears, it can't be different. 
Market fundamentals, like supply and demand, rule. But that's also the good 
news. High wholesale prices (and necessary profits) have done their job; they 
have brought forth a number of suppliers, in the form of more than a dozen 
plans for significant new generating plants; in fact, plans have even been 
announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines. Too, demand has 
started to abate; peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen 4% to 9% from 
last year, doubtless a response to a "temporary" 10% rate hike in January and 
the California Public Utilities Commission's decision in March to finally 
really, really raise rates by as much as 50% on average. (The details of that 
plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this month's 
bills.) 
So California's blame-shifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes 
over. The market is working, and imposing price caps would not only interrupt 
that process, but would be unnecessary. Of course, there is a painful lag 
between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market 
remedies of increased supply and lower demand. And California will probably 
feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and 
blackouts. 
But, in the long run, the market will be successful in creating new supply 
and lower prices. Unfortunately California's energy glut will probably come 
too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery. Ultimately 
we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has 
served them poorly.

After our very useful meeting with you yesterday, Sophie, and your HR 
colleague (Georgina? - I didn't get her surname), I have received from 
Viviana this follow up e-mail to a short conversation I had with her last 
week. You will recall that Paul stated his expectations at our meeting about 
the outcome of Viviana's next performance review. She has effectively started 
explaining her grievances to me. Your advice would be welcome.

Hello Peter, 

hope you're fine. 

I'm wondering whether it would be possible for you to call me today, because 
I would like to continue with you the discussion we started last week when I 
was in London.

I have to admit that I'm quite worried and I do not know what to expect. 

Thank you very much in advance.

Subject: Retail Deal with Food Industry Alliance Closed

Last week, an aggregation deal closed with the NY Food Industry Alliance 
(FIA). It will be booked with a margin of at least $1.3 million. I sublet 
office space from the Food Industry Alliance in Albany, and I initated 
discussions between them and EES last Fall. I also worked with both EES and 
the President of the FIA in the final stages to bring the deal to closure and 
resolve a number of issues raised by several of the FIA's members. My 
physical location in the FIA's office suite was actually used by the 
President as a selling point to his members in the face of a slighly less 
expensive offer from a competitor.

I am resending the same file as before (although to a larger group) and  need 
to make a correction regarding one assumption.  I am told the analysis does 
not yet include the gas indexed contracts.  We're working on getting them  
included and when they are, the overmarket value will likely increase.

Subject: DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
"mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re 
the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if 
Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, 
it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy

Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

I've been invited to speak next Friday at a Southern Gas Association 
conference.  I'm the speaker during a "Pipeline Right-of-Way Round Table" 
session.
The chair of the session from El Paso natural gas heard me speak last 
December here in Washington on the fiber optic federal lands ROW issue, and 
invited me to talk to the pipeline folks on how the fiber ROW fight will 
affect pipelines.
Attached is my proposed presentation -- I remember you asking some time ago 
to see any presentations we propose to make.
Approved?

Thanks,
Steve

This would be a good presentation for one of our quarterly meetings.  Maybe 
Lloyd or Tom would want to come to Colorado!

Christi,

Thanks for your help.  The whole services team appreciates all of your 
efforts.  I would be happy to give a brief presentation on what the Services 
Desk is doing when the regulatory group is in town for a get together.

Thanks again,

Tom.

Ginger -- Can you please forward to our North America group.  Thanks.





Some originators today reiterated how valuable Gov't Affairs can be in 
bringing deals (citing Tom Chapman -- Alamac and Dan Allegretti -UI).  The 
new East power services desk (headed by Lloyd Will and Tom May) is taking off 
and very interested in muni, industrial on-site generation purchases, 
scheduling, etc.  Origination (EPMI and EES) are interested in structured 
deals -- all requirements, tolling, etc.  Thanks for keeping this in mind 
while out there in the trenches!

Christi N.

Aleck & Richard:

Please find attached a copy of our synopsis/analysis of President Bush's
National Energy Policy.

While you are of course familiar with all of the details of the policy, I
thought you may be interested in our interpretation.

In particular, you may be interested in our brief remarks with regards to
the implications for the Canadian industry at the end of the document.

Hello, Corporate Fellows! June 1 has come and gone and we have only  received 
three responses to the survey. Many thanks to Pete Poynter of  BellSouth, 
Molly Phillips of Feld Entertainment and John Riggen of Agilent  Technologies 
for completing theirs on time. In order for us to respond  to your interests 
and to effect change in the program, we need to hear  from all of you. Again, 
I ask that you review the survey,  and a letter  and memo from  Ray that 
describes upcoming events and program improvements. Return the  survey to my 
attention no later than June 27. Our goal is to get  100 percent 
participation, so please take approximately 15 minutes and  complete the 
survey.  

On a separate note, June 15 is fast approaching. For those of  you interested 
in nominating yourselves or other Corporate Fellows for  the Steering Group, 
please do so as soon as possible. Again, complete  the nomin ation  form and 
return it to my attention. Also, if you haven't already done  so, take a look 
at the criteria for selection to determine eligibility.  

The Springtime in Washington reception was a big success. Sorry some  of you 
were not able to attend. You missed a wonderful evening of great  
conversation, good food and wonderful music - not to mention the location,  
which was one of the best. My sincere thanks to all of you who helped  make 
it a success. We could not have done it without your support. The  reception 
provided a great opportunity for our new intern, Brett Rosenberg,  to meet 
Corporate Fellows, Governors Washington Representatives, and NGA  staff. 
Brett will be with us until August 15 conducting research on a  wide variety 
of issues (including energy) that are important to the Corporate  Fellows.  

Hope all is well and that the approaching end of the legislative season  will 
find you all in good spirits.  

Regards, 
Lynn  

Annual Meeting in Providence, Rhode  Island 

As a reminder, the Annual Meeting will take place from August 4-7.  I have 
confirmed plans with my colleagues John Thomasian and Peter Wiley  to have 
the Corporate Fellows luncheon include governors chiefs of staff  and policy 
advisors. Again, I have only received one recommendation for  a luncheon 
speaker. Please complete the luncheon  speaker form with your suggestion(s) 
and return it to me as soon  as possible but no later than June 15.  

Please watch for news regarding registration for the Annual Meeting.  
Registrations this year will be done online only. The website should be  live 
on June 18. This year we will have two roundtables/task force  meetings, one 
on E-governance and the other on Growth and Quality of Life,  the chairman's 
initiative. Thom Rubel and Joel Hirschhorn respectively  will contact you 
directly regarding Corporate Fellows executives' participation  in the 
roundtables. Also, the Natural Resources Committee is planning  to have a 
discussion on biotechnology. Diane Shea, committee director,  and I will be 
working together to identify Corporate Fellows to participate  in this 
committee meeting.

Corporate Fellow Participation in Recent  NGA Meetings  

Coinciding with the unveiling of the President's energy policy report,  NGA 
sponsored an all-day Energy Policy Forum on Friday, May 18,  to inform and 
educate state representatives and other interested parties.  

Panel discussions and presentations covered a range of perspectives on  a 
number of critical and timely issues, including:  

the states and energy policy;
crafting a comprehensive energy policy;
fuel sources and production infrastructure;
energy delivery;
demand management: efficiency, conservation and price responsiveness;  and
regulating the nation's energy markets: federal and state roles.

Corporate Fellow panelists included American Electric Power (AEP), Dupont,  
Enron and ExxonMobil. Other Energy Policy Forum panelists included 
representatives  from state organizations, electric utilities, energy 
conservation and  environmental advocacy and research organizations, several 
energy-related  trade associations and a commissioner of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory  Commission (FERC). The forum presented several points of view 
related  to current and projected domestic energy supply and demand, 
deregulation,  environmental concerns, the roles of federal and state 
governments, and  anticipated effects of new energy policies on states and 
consumers. 

We appreciate the time that AEP, Dupont, Enron and ExxonMobil took to  
participate to ensure the success of the Energy Policy Forum. Many, many  
thanks. 

We further appreciate the participation of Blue Cross Blue Shield in  our May 
24 meeting titled "Making Healthcare More Affordable and Accessible  for 
Small Businesses."

of a provision in the Senate bill that  would cut states' share of revenues 
from the estate tax at a time when  most state revenue pictures are filled 
with budget cuts. Read  press release.

On May 14, NSTAR filed a complaint against Sithe and PG&E Trading, arguing=
=20
that both have generation market power in the Northeastern Massachusetts Ar=
ea=20
(NEMA) during times of transmission constraints and should not be permitted=
=20
to sell power at market based rates in that region during times of=20
constraint.  NSTAR contends that when transmission congestion occurs, the=
=20
market in NEMA cannot be considered workably competitive since Sithe and PG=
&E=20
own almost 90 percent (2,725 MW of the total 3,036 MW) of existing generati=
on=20
in NEMA.  NSTAR alleges that, had competition existed from September 1, 199=
9=20
=01) May 31, 2000, the cost of congestion relief in NEMA would have been ar=
ound=20
$2.3 million.  Due to Sithe=01,s and PGE=01,s market power, however, the co=
st was=20
actually $56 million.

Due to this market power, NSTAR asks the Commission to:  1)  revoke Sithe=
=01,s=20
and PG&E=01,s market-based pricing authority during periods of transmission=
=20
constraint in NEMA; 2)  require Sithe and PG&E to divest some of their=20
generation if they wish to have market-based rates during these times of=20
constraint; 3) develop a formula based on unit operation characteristics an=
d=20
fuel costs in order to calculate the marginal cost of each unit for Sithe a=
nd=20
PG&E; during times of constraint, these generators would be paid the higher=
=20
of the energy market clearing price (ECP) or their marginal cost; 4)  requi=
re=20
NE ISO to make all bid data, including unit operating characteristics,=20
available 90 days after the fact and allow for public disclosure of data,=
=20
mitigation processes, and implementation of mitigation agreements; and 5)=
=20
order Sithe and PG&E to refund all money collected by them in excess of the=
=20
applicable NEPOOL ECP from the time when congestion became a problem in NEM=
A.

The Commission is requesting comments and protests to be filed by June 4.  =
We=20
will intervene in this proceeding in order to monitor it, but please let me=
=20
know if you have any concerns or thoughts or would like us to take an activ=
e=20
role in this proceeding.

Also, PJM (including PJM West), New England and New York RTO proposals are =

FERC's agenda for Wednesday.  Interestingly, FERC's agenda shows the New=20
England and New York RTO cases as being considered in one order.  This may=
=20
just be a typo on FERC's part, but we will research it.

We'll keep you posted.

 The Premier's Office  (Didi Hayward) called  this afternoon to say that what 
she called the  "log jam" with respect to the proposed meeting has finally 
been overcome.   The Premier's Office has proposed the afternoon of  
Thursday, June 7 for 30-45 minutes  to be scheduled between the hours of 2pm 
and  4pm.    In my view, there is still considerable value in proceeding with 
this meeting  and hopefully Ken Lay could be available.   I would suggest 
that we propose the meeting to commence  in the 3:15 - 3:30pm timeframe,  to 
avoid the risk of the Premier being called back into the Legislature in the 
early afternoon and to increase the possibility that, if Lay and Harris are 
getting along, the meeting could run overtime without running into another 
scheduled meeting.  Please let me know how you wish to proceed in contacting 
Ken Lay about his availability, etc.  Regards, Aleck

 Contracts--Privileged and Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
"out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

I am attaching the presentation from the May 7th EGM all-employee meeting.   
Due to time constraints, the meeting covered only four of the EGM markets:   
coal, LNG, weather and crude/products.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO    
Updated: Monday, June 25, 2001 06:59 PM ET   Email this article to a friend! 
 Printer-friendly version  


By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

Rick,

Just wanted to give you a "heads up" that I will be digging around the DOJ 
regarding satellite issues as we have a potential antitrust issue on that 
front.  According to Fred Enochs (runs the satellite book for Fallon), 
satellite providers (and there are only a few of them to begin with) will not 
sell capacity to EBS unless we agree to their contractual terms regarding 
resale -- i.e., we cannot resell any satellite capacity that the provider 
sells to EBS.  As we are interested in trading satellite capacity, this type 
of restriction prevents players like EBS from creating/entering new markets 
for resale.  I have already touched base with Jade and she has promised to 
find the appropriate person for me to talk to.  

FYI: Fallon would like to see this prohibition attacked as well.  The three 
of us have discussed it.  I advised Fred that I would need either a contract 
from one of the providers that includes the restrictive language or some 
correspondence (e-mail or regular mail) that documents this activity; he is 
working on it.  As it turns out, Jamie Ginsberg's new company contacted EBS 
about satellite capacity and she related similar information to Fred 
regarding her own experiences with satellite providers.  As a result, we may 
be able to gather some useful information from her that we could reference at 
the DOJ to support our case.

I'll keep you posted as further developments arise.  

Hope you're enjoying San Antonio.

Lara

P.S.
Are you around at all tomorrow or next week?

 Political  Philosophies: Explained in Simple "Two-Cow" Terms
with an Update for the  state of California

Socialism: You have two cows. You keep one, but  must
give the other to your neighbor.

Communism: You have two cows.  The government takes
both and provides you with milk.

Fascism: You  have two cows. The government takes
both and sells you the  milk.

Bureaucracy: You have two cows. The government
takes them,  shoots one, milks the other, pays you
for the milk, and then pours it down  the drain.

Dictatorship: You have two cows. The government
takes both,  then shoots you.

Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell one and buy
a  bull.

Democracy: You have two cows. The government taxes
you to the  point that you must sell them both to
support a man in a foreign country who  has only one
cow, which was a gift from your own  government.

Corporation: You have two cows. You lay one off,
force the  other to produce the milk of four cows, then
act surprised when it drops  dead.

California: You have two cows. The state tells you how
to milk  your cows, when to milk your cows, how much to
milk your cows and the most  that you can charge for the
milk. You go broke and sell the cows. The state  calls you
greedy and blames you for the current milk shortage.

On Friday, we informed you about the IRS announcement that it will resume 
issuing private letter rulings on whether synthetic fuels produced from coal 
qualify for a tax credit under tax code Section 29.  Following is additional 
information from BNA. 
Section 29 provides a credit for the production and sale of "qualified fuels" 
produced from a nonconventional source, IRS said, including liquid, gaseous, 
or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite. In Rev. Proc. 2000-47 
(209 DTR G-1, L-1, 10/27/00), IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section 29 
because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not 
processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress. 
IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for 
which taxpayers claimed the credit. It received numerous comment letters, 
many urging it to resume issuing rulings, others agreeing that some processes 
should not qualify for the credit.  In Rev. Proc. 2001-30, IRS said it will 
issue a ruling on processes it had approved prior to 2000. The production 
process must meet the following requirements, IRS said: 

substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant 
chemical change; 
the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal 
comprised of particles no larger than 1/8 inch; 
the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed: (a) with styrene or other 
monomers following an acid bath, (b) with quinoline or other organic resin 
and left to cure for several days, (c) with ultra heavy hydrocarbons, or (d) 
with an aluminum and/or magnesium silicate binder after being heated to a 
minimum temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit; and 
the treatment method must involve elevated temperature and pressure that 
results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer 
may represent that the omission of these procedures will not significantly 
increase the production output of the facility.

The revenue procedure applies to both pending and future ruling requests. 
Rev. Proc. 2001-30 will be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2001-19, 
dated May 7.  See text below.

	EnergyIRS Revenue Procedure 2001-30 Announcing Decision to Issue Letter 
Rulings
On Whether Solid Fuel Produced From Coal Qualifies Under I.R.C. Section 29

Rev. Proc. 2001-30 is scheduled to appear in Internal Revenue Bulletin 
2001-19, dated May 7, 2001. 

Part III 
Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous 
26 CFR 601.201: Rulings and determination letters. 
(Also Part I, o29.) 
Rev. Proc. 2001-30

SECTION 1. PURPOSE 
This revenue procedure informs the public of the Internal Revenue Service's 
decision to issue private letter rulings regarding whether a solid fuel 
produced from coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C) of the Internal 
Revenue Code under the circumstances described in section 3 of this revenue 
procedure. 
SECTION 2. BACKGROUND 
Section 2.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3, 2001-1 I.R.B. 111, provides that whenever 
appropriate in the interest of sound tax administration, it is the policy of 
the Service to answer inquiries of individuals and organizations regarding 
their status for tax purposes and the tax effects of their acts or 
transactions, prior to the filing of returns or reports that are required by 
the revenue laws. There are, however, certain areas in which, because of the 
inherently factual nature of the problems involved, or for other reasons, the 
Service will not issue rulings or determinations letters. 
Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 sets forth those areas in which rulings or 
determination letters will not ordinarily be issued. "Not ordinarily" means 
that unique and compelling reasons must be demonstrated to justify the 
issuance of a ruling or determination letter. Section 2.01 of Rev. Proc. 
2001-3. 
Section 4.02(1) of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 provides that the Service will not 
ordinarily issue rulings or determination letters regarding any matter in 
which the determination requested is primarily one of fact, for example, 
market value of property, or whether an interest in a corporation is to be 
treated as stock or indebtedness. 
Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 sets forth those areas under extensive study 
in which rulings or determination letters will not be issued until the 
Service resolves the issue through publication of a revenue ruling, revenue 
procedure, regulations, or otherwise. 
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 provides that the Service will not issue 
rulings or determination letters on whether a solid fuel other than coke or a 
fuel produced from waste coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C). Waste 
coal for this purpose is limited to waste coal fines from normal mining and 
crushing operations and does not include fines produced (for example, by 
crushing run-of-mine coal) for the purpose of claiming the credit. 
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 supersedes Rev. Proc. 2000-47, 2000-46 
I.R.B. 482. Rev. Proc. 2000-47 was published because concern had been raised 
that taxpayers were claiming the o29 credit for processing coal in ways that 
may not have been intended by the Congress. Rev. Proc. 2000-47 requested 
comments concerning the standard to be applied in determining whether fuel 
produced from coal is a solid synthetic fuel. The Service received extensive 
comments. 
Section 29 provides a credit against income tax for the production and sale 
of "qualified fuels" produced from a nonconventional source. Section 
29(c)(1)(C) provides that qualified fuels include liquid, gaseous, or solid 
synthetic fuels produced from coal (including lignite). 
Rev. Rul. 86-100, 1986-2 C.B. 3, adopts for purposes of o29(c)(1)(C) the 
definition of synthetic fuel in o 1.48-9(c)(5) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
Section 1.489(c)(5)(ii) provides that, to be "synthetic," a fuel must differ 
significantly in chemical composition, as opposed to physical composition, 
from the substance used to produce it. Rev. Rul. 86-100 describes favorably 
processes such as gasification, liquefaction, and production of solvent 
refined coal that result in substantial chemical changes to the entire coal 
feedstock rather than changes that affect only the surface of the coal. 
Section 29(f) provides that o29 applies to qualified fuels that are produced 
in a facility placed in service after December 31, 1979, and before January 
1, 1993, and that are sold before January 1, 2003. Section 29(g)(1)(A) 
provides that a facility for producing qualified fuels described in o29(c)
(1)(C) is treated for this purpose as being placed in service before January 
1, 1993, if the facility is placed in service before July 1, 1998, pursuant 
to a binding written contract in effect before January 1, 1997. For a 
facility that meets this condition and is originally placed in service after 
December 31, 1992, o29(g)(1)(B) provides that the o29 credit applies to 
qualified fuels that are sold before January 1, 2008. 
Property is "placed in service" in the taxable year the property is placed in 
a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically 
assigned function. See, for example, o 1.167(a)11(e)(1)(i). Thus, the o29 
credit is not allowed for fuel produced in a facility that was originally 
placed in service for a function other than producing qualified fuel under 
o29(c)(1)(C) and was not converted into a facility for producing qualified 
fuel until after June 30, 1998. 
The Service interprets o29(f) and (g) to allow the o29 credit for qualified 
fuel produced in a facility after its modification only if the modification 
was placed in service before July 1, 1998, or does not significantly increase 
the production capacity of the facility or significantly extend the life of 
the facility. For example, a facility (including one of multiple facilities 
located at the same site) may be relocated without affecting the availability 
of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and 
the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly 
increased at the new location. If, however, the essential components of a 
single facility are combined after June 30, 1998, with other components that 
were not part of the facility on June 30, 1998, to create multiple facilities 
or significantly increase production capacity, the credit will not be allowed 
for fuel produced at any of those facilities. 
After reviewing the comments received in response to Rev. Proc. 2000-47 and 
reconsidering its interpretation of o29(c)(1)(C), the Service has decided 
that the significant chemical change standard of Rev. Rul. 86-100 is the 
correct standard. The Service has also decided to resume the issuance of 
rulings under o29(c)(1)(C), but only in the circumstances described below. 
The Service is willing to issue rulings that do not go beyond the processes 
approved in the rulings issued prior to 2000. One procedure common to all of 
those processes (other than processes for the production of coke and similar 
products) is the use of elevated temperature and pressure to produce 
briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product. The Service is also willing 
to rule with respect to a process that omits this procedure if the process is 
otherwise consistent with a process approved in a pre-2000 ruling and the 
omission of the procedure will not significantly increase the production 
output of the facility. Accordingly, the Service will issue rulings regarding 
whether a solid fuel (other than coke) is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C) 
under the circumstances described in section 3 of this revenue procedure. 
SECTION 3. PROCEDURE 
The Service will issue rulings that a solid fuel (other than coke) produced 
from coal is a qualified fuel under o29(c)(1)(C) if the conditions set forth 
below are satisfied and evidence is presented that all, or substantially all, 
of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a significant chemical change. The 
conditions are that: 
1. The feedstock coal consists entirely of coal fines or crushed coal 
comprised of particles no larger than 1/8 inch; 
2. The feedstock coal is thoroughly mixed in a mixer: (a) with styrene or 
other monomers following an acid bath, (b) with quinoline (C9H7N) or other 
organic resin and left to cure for several days, (c) with ultra heavy 
hydrocarbons, or (d) with an aluminum and/or magnesium silicate binder 
following heating to a minimum temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit; and 
3. The treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure 
that results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product, or the 
taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not 
significantly increase the production output of the facility over the 
remainder of the period during which the o29 credit is allowable. 
SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE 
This revenue procedure applies to all ruling requests, including any pending 
in the national office and any submitted after the date of publication of 
this revenue procedure. 
SECTION 5. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS 
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 2001-3 is revoked. 
DRAFTING INFORMATION 
The principal author of this revenue procedure is David McDonnell of the 
Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries). 
Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury participated in its development. 
For further information regarding this revenue procedure contact Mr. 
McDonnell on (202) 622-3120 (not a toll-free call).

All:

One thing to note is that while the DWR contracts are blended with the core, 
the non-core, if our curve come to be true, would enjoy the back end of the 
curve's lower price path.    

We calculated, based on the DWR's figures, the negative mark-to-maket at the 
various points in time:

6/02      $4.2B
12/02    $5.8B
6/03      $7.0B

While our curves differ, this gives an order of magnitute.

Subject: Concept for core/noncore Analysis

OK, I apologize, I've been trying to lock myself to the computer and crunch 
some #'s, but can't seem to get control of my schedule.  Wanted to lay out 
the core/noncore model that's been pitched (and that CMA showed keen interest 
in this morning) to see if we're all on the same page; but perhaps this is 
the analysis that you're already working on:

Split takes place either 1.1.03 or 6.1.03.
Core and noncore are responsible for the "DWR past purchases" (spread over 15 
years).
Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the 
short for the core)
Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts 
the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's 
going forward costs (with "forward costs" defined as all power costs 
attributable to the "post-core/noncore" transition date.

Let me know if this tracks with where we're headed.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick -- As I mentioned earlier, I had the exit interview with Joe Allen last 
week.  I received the following questions from Geriann today, but I think the 
questions are something that you should probably answer.  He currently has 
his contract which he has not yet signed, but I'll remind him I need no later 
than next week in order to pay his lump sum severance.

Please let me know if you'd like for me to work with him on these issues, 
with your guidance:

Joe Allen would like a copy of his contract.    <He still has the two 
originals of his contract>

We need to know who to handle the following expenses:

1. Can he put Austin Club dues on his expense report?

2.  Can he put his parking expenses on his expense report?

3.  Cell Phone?

4.  Subscription to newsletters and magazines?

Thanks, Geriann


Thanks.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page 
and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the 
language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime 
in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) 
capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to 
provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore 
deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll 
provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have 
Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 
days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order 
establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power 
delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction 
of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by 
suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to 
the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be 
exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the 
duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus 
if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective 
date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct 
such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue 
requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the 
revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond 
revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR 
bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If 
we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be 
necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR 
costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, 
would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the 
clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the 
bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the 
bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such 
that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the 
amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take 
precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund 
and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 
2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

Scott

***FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case
     A collection of high-powered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing 
room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into 
allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates. 
While a decision is still a way off, the presiding judge in the case 
made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market 
share in California before ruling on the case.
     The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial 
market power study by The Brattle Group, which was commissioned 
by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power 
abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. The 
Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso 
manipulated California's gas market -- a claim that remains 
strongly in dispute (see story, page 4).
     In an opening statement, FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge 
Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing. The 
burden of proof, he said, is on the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which filed the original Section 5 complaint against 
El Paso. But once a case is made, Wagner added, "the burden of 
going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso 
Merchant and the parties on its side of the table."
     The case originated last year, when the CPUC asked FERC to 
abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso 
Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant. The California regulators 
claimed the capacity award was rigged, and further complained of 
a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California.
     In March, FERC dismissed the CPUC's claim that there was 
favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity (GD 
3/29). But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ, saying 
the case raised larger questions of market power. According to 
FERC, certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a 
hearing before a decision can be rendered.
     One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the 
affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is 
just Southern California. The CPUC and Southern California Edison 
maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue, 
while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state.
     The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction. As 
Wagner noted in his opening remarks, "The question of the 
geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso 
Merchant's market share will be measured and the results."
     If the entire state is considered as a single market, said 
Wagner, then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that, 
depending on methodology, would range between 17% and 26.8%. 
But if the CPUC's contention that the market is Southern 
California holds up, he added, then El Paso Merchant's market 
share would be between 35% and 44.9%.
     Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how 
many players are involved in a particular market. Wagner said 
that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the 
number of players. In addition, he said that he would need a better 
geographic description of El Paso Merchant's capacity holdings 
and information on the price differential of gas between Northern 
and Southern California. 
     Finally, Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso. El 
Paso Merchant, he said, "should answer the CPUC's question as to 
why it subscribed for the involved [1.2 billion cfd] for 15 months 
when it had no market for that amount." In addition, said Wagner, 
El Paso should "show whether it sold in the secondary market 
short-term releases of the excess [capacity] at a price higher than 
it paid."
     Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain 
evidence.
     Given the volume of testimony involved, the case will require 
some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached. 
Noting that he received a nearly two-foot high stack of testimony 
last week, Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and 
prepared testimony "consumed a very beautiful Sunday in 
Washington." (RP00-241)     NH

***El Paso takes aim at Calif. Assembly, study
     In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market 
power controversy, El Paso is going on the offensive. The company 
yesterday issued a riposte to claims -- publicized by California 
Assembly members and major newspapers -- that it manipulated 
California gas prices. And it took close aim at The Brattle Group, a 
consultancy that has figured prominently in various 
investigations into the matter. 
     According to El Paso, The Brattle Group worked "hand-in-hand" 
with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El 
Paso and its subsidiaries for the run-up in gas prices in the 
Golden State. El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly e-mails 
as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an 
objective investigation. 
     As reported in Gas Daily, The Brattle Group's study of alleged 
market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant 
Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation (GD 
4/25). In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison, The 
Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated 
California-bound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the 
price differential between production basins and the California 
border.
     Drawing in large part on The Brattle Group's opinion, the 
California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently 
concluded that El Paso caused the price run-up (GD 4/20). 
Representatives of the Assembly's Democratic majority said The 
Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas 
prices at the California border was greater than could be 
accounted for through normal market forces.
     But according to El Paso, the subcommittee majority was -- 
deliberately -- wrong. The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee, 
said El Paso, was a "charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning" to shore up SoCalEd's case.
     "El Paso has recently obtained, through discovery in a 
proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the 
paid litigation consultant [The Brattle Group] for Southern 
California Edison," said El Paso in a statement. "This 
communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's 
failed energy policies."
     The correspondence included apparent requests from 
subcommittee staff members for help in "rebutting" El Paso's 
testimony before the Assembly. El Paso interpreted those requests 
as proof that the subcommittee majority "never intended" to write 
an objective report on the matter. 
     "We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its 
responsibilities to [SoCalEd's] consultants," said Norma Dunn, El 
Paso senior vice president of communications and government 
affairs. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified 
before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we 
learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of 
[SoCalEd's] litigation consultants to support SCE's litigation 
position." 
     Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities 
Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC (see 
story, page 1). Following yesterday's hearing, Dunn told Gas Daily 
that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against 
El Paso in the   national press. 
     The New York Times, for instance, has published articles that 
relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents. 
Dunn said it was "clear" that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the 
selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the 
public. 
     Prior to recess in yesterday's hearing, FERC Chief 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the 
need to restrict access to protected documents.     NH

El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a 'Sham' 
El Paso Corp. claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the 
blame for high gas prices in the state. It said recent hearings before a 
subcommittee were a "sham," and that it was "predetermined" that El Paso 
would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee 
majority yesterday. 
While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings 
yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge, the company publicly 
contested the results of the majority report (approved 3-2) of the California 
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight, which placed the blame on the 
energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state. The majority report 
says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the 
market, focusing on the same year-old capacity contract between El Paso's 
pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERC's investigation. 
Contrary to the majority report, however, are the conclusions of a report 
prepared for the two Republican members of the five-member subcommittee. That 
document said the hearings "produced no conclusive evidence" of price 
manipulation. 
Although the majority report has not been made public, "it is clear, based on 
accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents, that the 
subcommittee hearing was a sham," El Paso said in a statement. 
El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing e-mail 
correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the 
Brattle Group, a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison. The 
Brattle Group is one of El Paso's main opponents at the hearings this week 
before FERC's Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. Brattle 
accuses the company of costing Californians an additional $3.7 billion in gas 
costs over the past year. 
The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the 
consulting firm and the subcommittee staff. For example, a staff member said 
to Brattle Group's Matthew O'Loughlin, "I can't thank you and Paul enough for 
your testimony. It was beyond expectations, the members were highly 
impressed. The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a 
second day. We could have used it." 
El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's 
conclusions were "pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's failed 
energy policies." The subcommittee majority was working "hand-in-hand with, 
and relying on, SCE's consultant, the Brattle Group, in their so-called 
analysis," El Paso said. "In communications between the subcommittee staff 
and SCE's consultant, it is clear that SCE's consultant assisted in preparing 
questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested 
assistance from SCE's consultant in preparing the final report. 
"That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective 
investigation is clear... [R]ather than write an objective report based on 
the testimony, the staff went on to ask SCE's consultant for help in 
'rebutting' El Paso's testimony." 
"We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCE's 
consultants," said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Communications and 
Government Affairs for El Paso. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff 
and testified before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise 
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we learn that 
the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCE's litigation consultants 
to support SCE's litigation position. We are particularly concerned that 
after coordinating the questions to be asked, the Brattle Group testified 
before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group. It is obvious 
that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the 
beginning. Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to 
testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided 
to us, so that we would not have an opportunity to react." 
Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in 
hearings this week, it will be "vindicated." 
However, El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington. The FERC hearings 
pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas 
& Electric and Southern California Edison. 
The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its 
pipelines into the state, which in turn pushed prices up. If the charges are 
substantiated, FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money 
it earned due to price or supply manipulation. Such a ruling could have even 
broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas, the single 
biggest source of fuel for power plants in California, obviously contributed 
to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its 
knees and sent Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 
The details of the charges are well known at this point. Critics alleged that 
El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. received 
inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end 
up the big winners in an open season in February of last year. The open 
season involved 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California 
border. 
But in an order on complaint, FERC found "no merit in the allegations." It 
cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor 
its affiliates. Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated 
its standards of conduct. However, the Commission did not dismiss the 
allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation. It set the 
market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him 
to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, March 29). 
FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Paso's tracks. In testimony submitted 
last week before Judge Wagner, FERC staff's expert witness concluded that El 
Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market 
and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints 
existed. FERC Economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded that under certain 
circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern 
California gas market (see Daily GPI, May 14). 
The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso, the 
company said in its statement yesterday, but is attributable to the fact that 
demand for gas has far outstripped supply. Evidence presented at the 
California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized 
its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never 
restricted supply. Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have 
limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen 
dramatically, the company said.

Colleagues:
I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be 
of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria 
is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two 
years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs 
continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process, 
hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as "originators" creating 
bottom-line value through (as an example):
revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)
cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).

The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):
Simplicity
Consistency
Objectivity
Reasonableness
Equity

Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.  
With no specific preference, they are: 
 A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission 
connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)
 Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again, 
subjectively determined)
 The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the 
legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)
The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal
NPV of a project.  An extension would be the size of market identified or 
deals originated.
The market size that Enron is targeting.
Value at risk in a specific project or activity
The methodology adopted by the relevant regulatory regimen to calculated  
specific cost item that have been deferred, reduced, or avoided.  An 
extension would be the impact of tariffs determination after intervention (in 
part or total).
The buy/sell spread of a portion of the market size that was released after 
intervention.

I shall keep you posted with any change--in any case, it  shall not happen 
without full consultation with you--meanwhile, please let me know if you have 
any question in this regard.

It looks like Reliant is now using air quality requirements as justification 
for their high prices at their plants in CA.  We are checking to confirm that 
their facilities are in fact reaching their emission ceilings.


Pressure builds on Davis to relax air standards  



Updated: May 24, 2001 - 2:22 p.m.  

A major electricity supplier said Thursday it will sharply cut prices 
for power from three Southern California plants in anticipation that 
air quality monitors will let the plants release more pollution this 
summer.  

Meanwhile, aides said Gov. Gray Davis will consider paying 
businesses to run heavily polluting diesel generators to boost the 
state's power supply and help avert rolling blackouts.  

Reliant Energy said it could chop its power bids from the high of 
$1,900 per megawatt hour Davis criticized this month to as little as 
$150 per megawatt hour -- but only if air regulators quickly allow it 
to exceed pollution standards at the three plants.  

The Houston-based generator will cut its prices immediately, but 
will soon be forced to shut down three of its five Southern California 
plants for the rest of the year if pollution standards aren't lifted, said 
Joe Bob Perkins, president and CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group.  

Davis singled out Reliant's $1,900-per-megawatt-hour charge earlier 
this month as an example of the egregious prices he said 
generators should voluntarily cut.  

Reliant said it deliberately bid the high price to discourage the 
state's power grid operator from calling its high-polluting plants into 
use. Using the plants now eats up valuable pollution credits that 
will likely be needed to keep the plants running during even higher 
demand periods this summer, the company said.  

"In essence, we are doing exactly what Gov. Gray Davis has 
suggested. But if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out 
of power from these units very quickly," Perkins said in a 
statement.  

Perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against 
Reliant's yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into 
operation to help prevent blackouts.  

Reliant's Mandalay, Etiwanda and Ellwood plants each face annual 
air pollution limits imposed by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura 
County air pollution control districts. Reliant has asked for 
extensions from each of the districts.  

"There's no question we are in an emergency situation. We will 
consider every option available" to avert blackouts, said Davis 
spokesman Roger Salazar. But he said the administration had not 
seen Reliant's proposal.  

Davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup 
generators when necessary to avoid outages, Salazar said. 
Running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from 
the state's power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses.  

The proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged.  

"It's a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health 
consequences," said Paul Knepprath of the American Lung 
Association of California.  

The state should instead cut demand by encouraging more 
conservation, the lung association and 18 other consumer and 
environmental groups said in a letter to Davis on Wednesday.  

Davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health 
and public safety consequences too, Salazar said. The use of 
backup generators is being proposed by the administration's top 
energy advisers, but Davis has not yet seen the proposal, Salazar 
said.  

The governor is willing to "explore every conceivable option for 
generation this summer," Salazar said.  

The twin developments come the same week the administration cut 
by 20 percent its estimate of new power generation that will be 
available this summer. Davis now projects 4,000 additional 
megawatts, 1,000 megawatts short of his original estimate. A 
megawatt is enough power for about 750 homes.

> EVENTS:
>
> * Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta

> their critical functions would be seriously impaired," said Governor
> Davis.
>
> * Governor Davis, along with top executives and business leaders in
> the state, announce a joint-Declaration on Thursday committed to saving 20
> percent in overall electricity consumption. With more than 140 businesses
> and organizations statewide, this "energy-conservation" coalition sets the
> following goals among others to reduce energy use: (1) set temperatures
> for occupied space to 78 degrees from May to October; (2) reduce lighting
> levels by 25 percent and an additional 25 percent upon the declaration of
> a Stage II emergency; (3) close blinds and shades when possible; and (4)
> turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use.
>
> * QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not

> of back payments to some alternative-energy generators.  The PUC postponed
> their vote to June 13 on a proposal that would allow alternative
> generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it
> from PG&E and Edison to remain in business.
>
> * The California State Senate Rules Committee, in cooperation with the
> Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale
> Energy Market, agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further
> background information in its investigation into whether generators are
> illegally profiteering from the state's power crisis. Eight out-of-state

* Senate Bill 39xx: Public Utilities by Senator Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) and Assembly Bill 28xx: Electrical restructuring: Oversight
Board: Independent System Operator by Assembly Member Migden, both
originally to be heard in committee next Monday and Tuesday respectively,
have both been rescheduled to a to-be-announced later date. SB 39xx
"clarifies and enhances the state's PUC over in-state electric generating
facilities" while AB 28xx "expands the authority of the Electricity
Oversight Board and the ISO."

* Assembly Bill 35xx: Department of Water Resources: electrical
energy: eminent domain by Assembly Member Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) is
scheduled to be heard in the Assembly Judiciary Committee this upcoming
Tuesday. This bill would require the state Public Works Board to acquire
eminent domain proceedings for the possession and use of real property for
the generation of electrical power. This real property would be "paid for at
fair market value" and put under the control of the state Department of
Water Resources.  IEP opposes this bill, and will testify in opposition at
the hearing.

I attach a note I wrote for the head of Continental Trading that lays out the 
work that I -  
with support from the origination and regulatory collegeauges- have been 
engaged in. It is reasonably current. 
The examples of transaction support that have resulted in $$, are from the 
second half of 2000. The first six months
of this year have been focussed on advocacy work related to the revision of 
the German energy
law, negotiating a network agreement for gas, supporting EU investigations in 
abusive practices
and building up stronger political relationships through our trade 
association - EFET. 

The deal support efforts from this year thus far relate to:

Significant support provided to the German origination team to secure 
transport across Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy to provide gas to our first Italian customers. My work 
was focussed on 
getting the Swiss gas company to the negotiating table (something they were 
very reluctant to do) through
regulatory/legal pressures. Currently doing the same to secure TPA  to the 
Trans Austria gas pipeline and
the Baltic Cable - again employing our now well-established regulatory and 
legal pressures (bad cop tactics)
Gas pipeline access in Austria will allow us to significantly increase volume 
supplied to our Italian customers
Baltic access will allow us to begin actively arbitraging power price 
differentials between Germany and
Nordpool. Each of these will be firsts for newcomers in the European market. 

I hope this helps, Paul

OK on the call.

Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns.

A few things to think about. Here are a few options:

1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have "bid-zero" bilaterals if you want
but the basic mechanism is the same). This effectively gives you PJM, New
York, etc.

2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights
needed to schedule. That way you get the right plants on in the right
places, in theory at least. This might be interesting as a future
development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for use
now.

3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be
purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need
the flow right to schedule a transaction. This is the way that a bunch of
the RTOs seem to be going (e.g. Alliance). But this still leaves you needing
a way to create that feasible schedule. You can get feasibility by RT
through the LMP but my sense is that the RTO needs to make sure there is
enough capacity ready so that reliability can be protected. The problem of
the financial-only flowgate method in my book is that it doesn't meet one of
the key characteristics of a workable market - e.g. it doesn't really solve
the problem of congestion while there is time to do anything about it (e.g.
bring more plants online other than a few CTs, hydros, etc.). The RTO will
need some way to handle this problem, or else handle large volumes of MWh by
OOM calls at its discretion. I don't think we like that.

I was talking with some people about Alliance on Monday and they seem to
have sort of lost track of the ball, at least in my book. They are now
talking about an alternative method for dealing with day-ahead congestion.
This would effectively take the form of the re-dispatch type process used in
California. My view is that this sounds pretty clumsy, adds a lot of
complication, and will be great fun for the big generators in Alliance.
Under this system I want to be AEP - the 600 pound gorilla of the region.
And it is still effectvely centralized - the ISO takes in inc/dec bids and
broadcasts out prices, calculated by the OPF model. It has all of the
elements of LMP, just done more than once. If I am a big intergrated
generator/load utility with market power I can repeat the old games of
creating congestion by my scheduling in a constrained area and then getting
paid to unwind it.

So I think we have some basic questions to address next week on the call. I
just want to make sure we get an RTO model that can be made to work without
too much duct tape and bailing wire. If we want to jump off the centralized
unit commitment train we may need to go back and consider all of the
economic angles quite carefully. I am generally sympathetic to the
decentralized commitment idea but I also want to make sure we don't end up
with a muddle.

Cheers

Yes. ?I'd like a call early next week with some internal staff to discuss.
Some key issues on language and some real reservations on "centralized"

Greetings,
These are the latest events related to the Jose LNG project:
A working group from the Ministry of Energy is furiously working to finish 
the Gas Availability Report to be presented to the Ministry of Energy by the 
end of this month. The balance of gas is the variable that, according to the 
Ministry, will determine the fate of gas export projects. PDVSA-Gas is very 
optimistic that the gas will be there (they are participating in the working 
group, and pushing for a positive outcome).
The E&P Gas Round bid is proceeding according to schedule. Bids are expected 
by the end of June and there seems to be significant interests from 
participants. The Gas Availability Report would be made public after the bid 
date, sometime in July (we would know before then, however). 
Although a successful round will definitively help the project, the threshold 
for success seems to be relatively low. If only two or three of the nine 
fields are allocated, the round will still be considered successful. Even if 
the fields are not allocated in this round, PDVSA-Gas would develop some of 
them, and the LNG project would still be approved.
Regards,
ALF

With the continued growth of some of the more non-traditional businesses at 
Enron; e.g., broadband, agricultural commodities, steel, etc..., it has 
become apparent that additional support from Government Affairs, of these and 
other non-traditional businesses, is necessary.  To that end, I've asked 
Harry Kingerski to focus his time and efforts more fully on developing his 
support group's (Government Affairs Support Services) capabilities, with an 
objective of broadening their support beyond EES and ENA.  With the void that 
Harry leaves in formally directing our group's efforts on behalf of EES, I've 
asked Jim Steffes to assume a leadership role with respect to EES as well as 
ENA. I've also asked Lisa Yoho to assume responsibility for Enron Industrial 
Markets in addition to her responsibility for Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Networks.  No further organizational changes are being made at this time but, 
as always, organizational flexibility in how our group responds to the needs 
of the business units will be the order of the day.  I am confident that all 
of us will support Harry, Lisa and Jim with their additional 
responsibilities. Thank you.

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

FERC issued three CA orders today.  Ray Alvarez sent out a summary on the 
order related to increasing Generation and Transmission in the west. The 
report below came from IEP's attorney.

Underscheduling -- Enron has been on both sides on this issue -- here's 
what's happened

One CA order rejects the requests by PG&E, SoCal Edison and the CAISO to
suspend the underscheduling penalty adopted in the December 15th Order.  The
Commission is currently reviewing data filed by the CAISO in conjunction
with a request to waive the underscheduling and will address the
underscheduling penalty in a future order.  The Order does accept the
CAISO's proposal to split the BEEP stack into Operating Reserves and
Imbalance Energy.


QFs -- Ridgewood Complaint

The second order address QF issues.  Granting, in part, Ridgewood and CCC's
request for emergency relief, the Commission ruled that when QFs sell excess
power or make third party sales as authorized by a court, the California
utilities must provide interconnection and transmission service to make
those sales.  The Commission deferred decision on whether QFs that have not
been fully paid can make third party bilateral sales.


Obstacles -- Subject of Ray's earlier e-mail

The third order addresses obstacles to increased energy supply.  The
Commission takes a number of actions, including allowing premium returns on
equity (200 basis points) and accelerated depreciation (10 years) for
projects that increase transmission capacity in the short term (July 1,
2001).  The basis points go down if the project comes on later.  The order
also allows rolled-in treatment of interconnection and upgrade costs for new
supply, broadens and extends QF waivers of operating and efficiency
standards, waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate
authority for sales from back-up and self-generation in WSCC, authorizes
certain demand side sales and management programs, and encourages pipeline
construction projects.

More to follow when we review the orders.

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data
Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information 
crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price 
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy 
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.

Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information 
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But 
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without 
Duke's consent.

The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have 
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in 
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the 
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout 
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and 
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential 
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and 
which stay secret.

"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what 
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information 
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month 
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what 
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the 
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity 
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its 
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full 
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, 
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, 
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full 
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions 
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive 
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke 
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the 
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in 
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and 
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to 
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke 
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the 
committee plans to turn over.

"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we are 
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't 
know what we are ultimately going to do."

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they 
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have 
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, 
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are 
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally 
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the 
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited 
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most 
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

		 Subject: Southern RTO - Questions & Issues

The following is a set of issues I thought about while reading the Southern 
RTO paper.  Not necessary critical, but something to think about.

1. Do we have an understanding of the big issues for MEAG, Dalton, and other 
public power?  We need to be working these groups hard to make sure they 
don't agree too quickly.  
                THEY ARE SAYING THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO A FOR-PROFIT 
ARRANGEMENT.  THEY SEEM TO BE IGNORING THAT THE PRPOSAL SAYS A TRANSMISSION 
OWNER CAN KEEP THEIR ASSETS, PAY THE GRIDCO A FEE FOR OPERATIOS, AND NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN THE LLC.  I KNOW THIS IS CONFUSING, BUT APPARENTLY TVA IS 
SAYING THE SAME THING AS MEAG.  I WILL DISCUSS THIS FURTHER WITH MEAG THIS 
WEEK.
 
2. I like the concept of a Gridco - for-profit company that does not own 
assets but operates transmission grid.  It seems to blend pros and cons 
well.  Key will be incentives.
               THEY ARE SETTING IT UP TO EVENTUALLY OWN ASSETS.  YES, THE 
INITIAL KEY IS INCENTIVES AND THE TRANSMISSION OWNERS ARE CONTROLLING THE 
INCENTIVES AS A PART OF THERE STATED REQUIREMENT TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF 
THEIR ASSETS.

3. I agree with SOCO that S-T Reliability "authority does not extend to 
initial unit commitment and dispatch decisions for generators".  Does this 
imply no tight pool?  From later description, it looks like SOCO is proposing 
LMP for settlements.
               THE RTO IS NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN UNIT COMMITMENT OR DISPATCH 
DECISIONS, UNLESS  MANDATORY  REDISPATCH IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN FIRM SERVICE 
OR THERE IS A SYSTEM EMERGENCY.
 
4. Not sure that I like the conclusion that "SERC Southern sub-region" is 
preferred but probably not much success in pushing for bigger region? 
                APPARENTLY THEY COULD NOT GET CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER WITH 
GRIDSOUTH TO COMBINE INITIALLY.  SOUTHERN REALIZES THEY WILL HAVE TROUBLE AT 
FERC ABOUT THE SIZE AND ARE JUST SAYING ITS BIG ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE STARTUP 
OF A RTO.

5. I wonder what TVA thinks about this filing?
               WE ARE HEARING THAT TVA WANTS A NON-PROFIT ARRANGEMENT AND 
CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT LEGISLATION.  WE NEED MORE DISCUSSION WITH THEM 
ALSO.  THAT'S NOT MY TERRITORY, BUT I'LL BE GLAD TO PURSUE IT.

6. Interesting idea that Gridco could become Transco for future transmission 
upgrades (pg 31).  What form of capitalization would be necessary?  SOCO 
seems to think this won't happen.  
               THEY ARE SAYING PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR INITIAL FINANCING AND 
THINK IT WILL BE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY 
WILL HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH THE GRIDCO TO ALLOW ANY CONSIDERATION OF AN 
IPO.

7. Why does SOCO want Market Monitoring inside Gridco?  Why not have Gridco 
contract this service?
                 THEY THINK FERC WANTED THIS.  I THINK THEY WOULD BE WILLING 
TO TURN IT OVER TO A 3RD PARTY.  WE WILL ASK THEM THIS WEEK.  

8. I don't think that SOCO should keep the ROFR for new transmission.  New 
transmission plant investment should be driven by market rewards.
                I AGREE.  WE NEED TO PUSH FOR THIS TO BE OPEN AND FOR THE 
EXISTING OWNERS TO BE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT.
  
9. Why not allow Enron to "finance" the Gridco operations?  On-going 
operations should be contained within OATT?  We may do it without any voting 
control.  Couldn't we finance a startup venture and sell services to SOCO?
               THEY HAVE MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT THEY ARE 
CONSIDERING AN ALTERNATE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INVOLVE A THIRD PARTY COMING IN 
TO JUST OPERATE THE RTO, BUT AT THIS POINT THEY DO NOT KNOW OF ANYONE 
QUALIFIED TO DO IT OR INTERESTED IN DOING IT.  ARE YOU READY TO PROPOSE ENRON 
DOING THIS AND ALLOWING IT TO BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT?

10. I think that SOCO should simply arrange for Gridco "lease" of TO 
facilities for 10 years, with an option to buy or sell.  I don't really 
understand why TOs would "pay a fee to have Gridco operate their assets"? (pg 
50).
              SAME AS ABOVE.  THE ONLY TIME A FEE IS PAID IS WHEN A NON-LLC 
TRANSMISSION OWNER TURNS THEIR OPERATIONS OVER TO THE GRIDCO.

11. Agree with providing Gridco incentives to operate well - including maybe 
losing money (pg 53).  How do these get established?
               THE TRANSMISSION OWNERS PLAN TO SET THE INCENTIVES AND CONTROL 
ANY CHANGES.

12. Why have the TOs determine the Board of Directors?  Gridco is an 
independent, self-financed company.  SOCO may not want to sign a lease with 
Gridco but it shouldn't determine BoD.
                THEY WANT TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS  AND CONSIDER 
THIS NECESSARY TO DO SO.

13. I don't understand the restriction on "potentially significant adverse 
effect on value of assets"?  Which assets?  I assume only transmission.  (pg 
61).  I would simply argue that the lease agreement deal with this question.
               YES, ITS ONLY THE TRANSMISSION ASSETS.

14. Why the requirement to have "balanced schedules" DA and HA? (pg 67)
                NEEDED TO EVALUATE RELIABILITY.

15. There appears to be some confusion on Flowgate model and reference to 
Contract Path? (pg 68)
                YES, THERE IS A MIXED BAG.  WE WILL DISCUSS THAT WITH THEM 
THIS WEEK.  THINK THEY DID IT BECAUSE NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS ARE DOING IT
.
16. Real-time settlements pricing appears to use LMP but I don't see any 
reference to bids? (pg 70)
                 YES, THEY TAKE VOLUNTARY BIDS FOR GENERATORS AND LOADS.

17. SOCO continues to use 888 OATT terms like Network Service.  My current 
thinking is that our new tariff (Project e-trans) provides only one Service = 
Network Plus.
               THEY AREN'T THERE YET.  WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSED THIS WEEK.

18. Disagree with RTO operating secondary market for FTRs (pg 75)
                I THINK THEY THINK THIS IS NEEDED JUST TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT'S 
AGREED TO.  WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO GIVE IT UP IF EVERYONE IS ALWAYS 
AWARE OF WHO OWNS WHAY RIGHTS.

19. Does RTO only operate 100 kv and above?  What about lower voltages?
               THEY MODIFIED THAT LAST WEEK.  WILL BE WHATEVER THE GRIDCO 
DECIDES IS NEEDED FOR WHOLESALE.  SAID THEY WERE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE 69 
KV SYSTEM, BUT WOULD USE FERC'S 7 FACTOR TEST TO DECIDE.

20. Transmission Pricing is probably biggest problem given SOCO insistenance 
on retail bundled customers (pg 104).
                AGREE. AMEA HAS RAISED A QUESTION ABOUT PRICE SQUEEZE BECAUSE 
IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO GENERATION TO SERVE THEIR 
LOAD THAN IT WOULD BE FOR ALABAMA POWER TO SERVE THE SAME LOAD.

21 SOCO proposal on initial ROE as wgt avg as highest of state's jurisdiction 
is worth how much???
                DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.  HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NUMBERS YET.

22. Does Enron have a policy on Transmission Losses?
                THOUGHT YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PRICE CERTAINTY AND 
COMPARABILITY.  IF THERE ARE OTHER  CONCERNS, LET ME KNOW.

23 On incentives for new Transmission plant, why not give developers the FTRs 
created?
                DON'T THINK SOUTHERN IS EVEN THINKING ABOUT 3RD PARTIES 
BUILDING TRANSMISSION AT THIS POINT.

In general, an interesting opening offer from SOCO.  I guess I am still 
confused over how a bundled retail customer will have priority in this model.

We also need to work with state PUCs to see what they are thinking about 
this.  Especially to try and learn what SOCO is saying about Native Load 
exception.

Finally, SOCO seems to say only one control area.  Is this right?

Jim 

YES, ONLY ONE CONTROL AREA IS WHAT THEY PROPOSE, BUT WILL ALLOW MORE THAN 
ONE.  I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TELLING THE OTHER POTENTIAL PARTIES THAT THE ONLY 
WAY THEY GET ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE RTO AT A POSTAGE STAMP RATE IS TO AGREE TO 
ONE CONTROL AREA.  NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRIORITY OF BUNDLED RETAIL.  
LOOKS LIKE THEY GET NONE, JUST PROTECTION FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASE 
WITH THE TRANSITION.  I AGREE WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON THE PUCS; PLAN TO 
START ASAP.

Dear Sue, Scott and Steve -- The letter below from George Gilder to FCC
Chairman Powell sets important parameters for our "vision".  We anticipated
that Powell would be unimpressed, if not hostile, to "open access"
approaches, but this should put a nail in the coffin.  The watchword will be
"innovation".  I imagine that both "Telecosm" and Hamel's "Leading the
Revolution" are high on Powell's reading list! 

We look forward to talking with you next week.  Aileen.

This is an interesting letter to Commissioner Powell published last week.
Given the level of respect that the Commissioner has for Mr. Gilder (MKP has
repeatedly referenced Gilder's book Telecosm and speaks of him frequently),
it may be worth reading.  In any event, it gives a pretty good 30,000 foot
view of telecom policy considerations.

The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero
By George Gilder and Bret Swanson

  Dear Mr. Powell:

  Whether you know it or not, your leadership and decisions over the next
four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

   Surely, our stock-market swoon of 2000 and stagnating economic growth in
2001 are partly due to the Fed's inexplicable liquidity leash combined with
the highest tax burden since World War II. But the chief threats to the
21st- century economy are the politicians, bureaucrats and Silicon Valley
know-nothings responsible for America's broadband connectivity crisis.

  We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction
that narrowband links would prevail into the 21st century. The Internet as
we know it is about seven years old, yet fewer than 7 million of 100 million
American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social, commercial and
educational opportunities.

  Contrary to popular belief, the chief obstacle to progress is not
entrenched Bell operating companies, but a regulatory regime that presumes
to "level the playing field," "equalize access," and "promote competition."
The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and
paralysis of broadband.

  The 1996 Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to
enter the long-distance telephone business, the Bells must open their
residential copper lines to competitors, as well as allow these competitors
to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber
line (DSL) services over Bell-owned copper. In November 1999, the FCC issued
a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and
cooperate.

  The FCC actions spawned a new category of start-ups known as broadband
competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), which planned to compete with
the Bells. Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital
and public offerings, companies like Rhythms, Northpoint, Covad and Jato
earned praise from "libertarians" in both Washington and Palo Alto, Calif.
Northpoint even had freedom-loving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its
board.

  But despite all good intentions, these were not high-tech start-ups. They
became venture capital-funded lobbying and litigation shops intent on
forcing the Bells to share their copper. With more press releases on new
lawsuits than on new subscribers, one of the companies epitomized the
strategy: "Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation." The result
of all this lawyering? The CLECs won everything. Access to copper wherever
they sued. Multimillion- dollar awards from the Bells. And bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy?

  Late last year, Northpoint filed for Chapter 11 after Verizon withdrew an
$800 million investment. Jato closed its doors. Rhythms cut its staff by
23%. Covad is slashing 800 jobs and closing 260 central offices. Of Covad's
274,000 lines in service, 92,000 are not "recognizing revenue." And all of
this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband
services.

  The problem is that DSL is risky and hard. Some studies have reported that
50% of DSL hook-ups fail on the first try. Even amicable relationships
between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare, with a different billing
and provisioning system for each service provider. Such difficulties render
DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial
risks. Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering
personnel, but have few opportunities for outsized rewards.

  That's because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which
everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money. Often
barred from carrying signals across long-distance boundaries, the Bells hand
off traffic to other long-distance carriers. CLECs rent lines from the
Bells. And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service
and marketing to get people signed up in the first place. In short, as many
as four parties routinely battle for low- or negative-margin chunks of
$40-monthly bills.

  By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in
open access, the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized
the profits. By December, the Bells had signed up 1.8 million users and the
CLECs 600,000, combining for just 2.4 million DSL subscribers among the 120
million or so copper-connected U.S. homes and businesses.

  Cable modems, with 4.9 million subscribers at year-end, have done better,
but AOL Time Warner and AT&T, America's two cable behemoths, are bogged down
by the same open-access nonsense that plagues DSL. Over the past two years,
AT&T CEO Michael Armstrong acquired $140 billion in cable assets while
watching his company's $184 billion market capitalization plummet to $81
billion.

  Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner
must offer "at least one non-affiliated cable broadband ISP [Internet
Service Provider] service on Time Warner's cable system before AOL itself
begins offering service, followed by two other non-affiliated ISPs within 90
days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that."
The nation's second-largest ISP, EarthLink, will now get access to AOL's
expensive cables pretty much for free.

  This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic, technically creative, and
transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static
commodity market for corn or pork bellies.

  Mr. Chairman, in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is

more important than price competition. When it comes to leading-edge
services and technologies, narrow price competition is almost meaningless.
Internet innovation means qualitative change, order-of-magnitude price
reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute
monopolies when first launched.

  No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years. In 1999 and
2000, over 150 million kilometers of optical fiber were laid world-wide,
enough to stretch to the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars have already
been invested by metropolitan fiber-optic network builders (Metromedia
Fiber, Level 3 Communications), optical hardware companies (Avanex, ONI,
Sorrento) and optical service providers (Yipes, Cogent, Sphera). These
companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with
thousand-fold increases in price performance over existing technology.
Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless. But none of
these deployments, including fiber to the home, can flourish under a regime
of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits.

  In this environment, let the Bells compete in long-distance and extort any
temporary profits they can from their local copper cages. Let the cable
companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last.
Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its
owners wish. Then, sit back, and nostalgically recall those early days of
the Internet, when we naively thought a 5% economic growth rate was really
something. The broadband economy needs a hero. President Bush and Mr.
Greenspan need a technology savior. You are the man best equipped to play
that role.

These comments on FERC's proposed gas reporting requirements are due on June 
18.  The draft takes the position that the FERC should NOT adopt reporting 
requirements for natural gas sellers, which is a different approach than some 
of you had discussed earlier.  If after reading my very persuasive comments, 
the consensus is we should not oppose the reporting requirements but rather 
attempt to water them down, I will of course rewrite the comments (or resign 
in protest).

On page 6, I make the argument that we do not do our business in the manner 
the reporting requirements seem to contemplate.  I go through a very high 
level description of our "books," but I really do not want to be more 
specific, as we then get into proprietary matters.  Where we have given FERC 
the more detailed description, we have asked for confidential treatment.

Please get comments back to me and Becky as quickly as you can.  Thanks.

Rick:
I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.

The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining 
the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  
I look forward for your comments and advise.

Best regards

AI

Here are the salient features:
Meeting with Wade:
The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs 
to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and 
agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support 
from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what 
needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an 
effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) 
just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be "penny wise 
and pound foolish" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that 
Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is 
complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. 
GA Needs in India:
The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five 
areas: 
a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), 
b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, 
c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), 
e)  Government of India, and 
f)  EBS.  
The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following 
scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) 
Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of 
yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:

        Arbitration  Renegotiation
Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high
Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high
Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high
Government of India, and      high   high
EBS.         medium  medium

It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC 
seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the 
sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the 
best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any 
degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a 
risk-averse person shall take the "undetermined scenario" as equal to 
"renegotiation", while a risk-taker shall take the "undetermined"" as equal 
to arbitration.  

Personal:
It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in 
the "renegotiation" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a 
visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working 
under legal/commercial.  

Suggested Approach:
Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for 
the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the 
suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is "if there is 
renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full 
time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis".  

Caveat:
It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the 
suggested approach above one way or another.

		 Subject: India - Progress Report One

Rick: 
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and 
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting 
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from 
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing 
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support".  
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give 
Houston the final say.   

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA 
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and 
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, 
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit 
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams 
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation 
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the 
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is 
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market 
basis, but rather on accounting basis.  
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely 
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added 
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated 
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to 
complete phase II which we are refusing).  
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy 
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW 
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such 
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks 
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every 
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and 
solved.  
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest 
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them 
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned 
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the 
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the 
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the 
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment 
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the 
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of 
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there 
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for 
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to 
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you 
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Declares Bankruptcy

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (NYSE: PCG), the utility unit of PGOCorp., on 
Friday filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. 
The company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy 
costs, which are now increasing by more than $300 million per month; 
continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company; and the 
now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis and his 
representatives are going nowhere. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. reportedly has 
more than $9 billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases. 
Neither PGOCorp. nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its National 
Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are affected by the 
utility's filing.  

Analysis: Despite the fact that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy 
filing has been in the making for several months, and that its financial 
insolvency appeared inevitable, the actual filing for Chapter 11 protection 
on Friday caught many by surprise, including California's top officials. 
Ironically, the utility's 13 million customers may end up being the least 
impacted by the bankruptcy, as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will remain in the 
business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court. 
However, there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of California's 
largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and 
across the country, the full impact of which is not presently known.  

There naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major 
news, so I won't waste time regurgitating information that is being widely 
disseminated. Rather, I will focus on what I believe to be some of the key 
elements of this story. 

1. The bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to PGOthat the 
state of California would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a 
price that PGObelieves the assets to be worth. In addition, a new rate 
increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co.'s  existing debts. The night before the bankruptcy filing, 
Gov. Davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated 
that the rate increases would be contingent on PGOselling the transmission 
assets to the state. In other words, if PGOagreed to the state's price for 
the transmission assets, a portion of the rate increase would be used to 
alleviate the utility's subsequent debts. The inside word is that Pacific Gas 
& Electric Co. was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to 
disagreements with Gov. Davis regarding the price of the transmission assets, 
which could be anywhere from $3 billion to $9 billion. Officially, Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co. said that its negotiations with the state "were going 
nowhere." The CPUC had previously approved rate increases of up to 46 percent 
for the customers of SCE and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., but clearly 
stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing 
debt. In his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy, Gov. Davis 
reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for non-residential 
customers that would average about 26.5 percent. Davis had fiercely resisted 
any form of a rate increase to accommodate Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s debt. 
The official PGOresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to 
pay off existing debts of the utility operation. 

2. PGOCorp. and other non-utility subsidiaries are not impacted by the 
bankruptcy measure (at least for now). Due to a shrewd financial 
restructuring that was approved by FERC a few months ago (see 1/12/01 Issue
Alert for more information), high-profit subsidiaries such as National Energy 
Group and PGOGas Transmission Northwest Corp. were placed into a 
special-purpose, bankruptcy remote entity known as GTN Holdings LLC. 
Consequently, these non-regulated subsidiaries (along with the parent 
corporation) may not be impacted by the utility's bankruptcy filing. The U.S. 
federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits 
were divided among the parent operation and other non-regulated subsidiaries, 
but for the time being only Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has declared 
bankruptcy. 

3. Power suppliers still owed money by PGOcould likely never get paid. Much 
of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s $9 billion debt is owed to power suppliers 
that sold power to the utility over the last year or so. With the onset of 
lengthy legal proceedings, it becomes more unlikely that these power 
suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon. Consequently, power 
suppliers owed more than $100 million by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. also saw 
their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement. According to 
a report in Reuters, Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) was down $2.65 or 6.25 percent 
at $30.75; Dynegy Corp. (NYSE: DYN) was off $2.58 or 5.07 percent at $48.34; 
Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB) was $2.26 or 5.4 percent lower at $39.60; and 
Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI) lost $2.70 or 5.95 percent to $42.65. In addition, 
there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be 
willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company (even if the state of 
California remains involved as the buying intermediary). For its part, 
PGOCorp. Chairman Bob Glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to 
eventually "pay all our debt" in full but he did not report a specific 
figure. In addition to the power suppliers, banks that have provided loans to 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo and J.P. 
Morgan Chase) could all be impacted by the bankruptcy. Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co.'s preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as Bank of New 
York, to which it owes more than $2.2 billion. Although some payments may be 
made after years of litigation, such lenders and bondholders may be forced to 
write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. as losses.  

4. The blame game is in full force. Davis and state regulators have 
repeatedly blamed out-of-state generators for price gouging and federal 
regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices. 
Also, Gov. Davis has issued harsh words against PG&E. Over the weekend, Davis 
appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate PGOfor awarding 
an estimated $50 million in bonuses and raises to about 6,000 midlevel 
managers and support staff on the eve of the utility's bankruptcy filing. 
"Management at PGOis just focused upon padding their own pockets, not in 
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California," Davis 
reportedly said. Earlier, Davis had previously issued a statement saying 
PGO"management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed." In 
addition, California regulators have criticized FERC for not implementing 
wholesale price caps in the Western region, which they believe would help to 
stabilize the market in California. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that, "it 
is inexcusable that FERC has refused to intervene and provide temporary 
stability and reliability [through the use of wholesale price caps]." 
Feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price 
caps for the entire Western region. For its part, FERC refused to take 
responsibility for the California crisis, saying instead that Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing was "the unfortunate result of a massive 
failure by policymakers at all levels." PGOblames decisions made by the CPUC 
and Gov. Davis that it believes "undermined" its ability to return to 
financial viability and recover its uncollected costs. Specifically, 
PGOblames the California government for not allowing it to recover prior 
wholesale power costs through recent rate increases, which essentially has 
kept the utility in a debt situation. PGOalso believed that the governor was 
not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of PG&E's 
transmission system to the state.  Consumer groups continue to lambaste the 
utility and its parent company, which they claim has $30 billion in available 
capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt.  

5. Could the bankruptcy filing of SCE be far behind? The second-largest 
utility in California continues to maintain that it intends to avoid 
bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a "comprehensive solution to our 
current crisis." However, because the two utilities have been so closely 
linked through the state's energy crisis, PG&E's decision to declare 
bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that SCE will eventually follow suit. In 
fact, Moody's Investors Service is reporting that Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co.'s bankruptcy increases the possibility of an SCE bankruptcy filing. 
Further, Moody's is reporting that numerous creditor groups, particularly the 
small generators, have become impatient with the time that it has taken to 
advance settlement discussions with the state of California, thereby 
increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors. 
On April 6, the day of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing, shares 
of SCE tumbled $4.29, or nearly 34 percent, to finish trading at $8.35. 
Surprisingly, SCE shares jumped about $2.00 by mid-morning on April 9, to 
trade at about $10.00. The reason for the increase is not fully known, 
although SCE continues to remain involved in negotiations with Gov. Davis 
regarding its own outstanding debt. 

6. This is just the start of a long, drawn out legal process. The electric 
utilities that previously declared bankruptcy (including El Paso Electric, 
Public Service Company of New Hampshire and El Paso Electric) all found 
themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years. Thus, although 
we may not know the ultimate outcome for Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s 
bankruptcy proceedings, we do know that the company will be essentially 
consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial 
records for the foreseeable future. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali 
of San Francisco has been assigned the PGOcase. Montali will have the 
ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how PGOreorganizes or 
arranges to repay its debt. Several positive elements of the process that 
might work to PG&E's advantage is that the utility will now be held 
accountable to only one individual, Judge Montali. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and 
federal lines. Second, by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are 
completed, market dynamics hopefully will have improved and California's 
supply problem should be resolved. Consequently, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
could eventually rise again, like the phoenix out of its ashes, and emerge as 
a much stronger company than it is today.

We were wondering if industrials would need to file "expedited" EWG filings 
in order to take advantage of the ImPower order and the FERC order on Interim 
Reliability measures issued Wed. (see separate email with details of relaxed 
filing requirements for industrials).

Per Dan Watkiss, if an on-site generator is wholly-owned by the parent 
corporation and is not owned by a separate generating company, then there are 
no holding company issues and no EWG filing is needed.  Therefore, this is a 
fact specific issue when we do an on-site generator deal, but in most cases 
EWG filings will not be necessary.

S,rgio: 

As we agreed, I prepared this list of key regulatory points to be agreed 
among ourselves. The idea is that this list should serve as a basis for 
Enron's advocacy plan. As you pointed out, life has been so hectic and we 
have been in some many battle fields,  that we did not have too much time to 
discuss and agree on our update, own view. Therefore, some of us, including 
myself, may have lost sight on what is ultimately good to Enron given the 
complexity of issues and their state of flux. Given the potentially 
conflicting coalitions we are part of, this should also serve as a basis for 
defining our position and role in each of those institutions. Finally, this 
could also serve as a basis for our internal and external communication 
plans. 


Overall Guiding Principles

1) As an overrarching objective for Enron all over the world, we defend, 
inter alia, markets, competition both at retail and wholesale levels, 
contract sanctity, free prices and customer choice.

2) We will balance our short term and long term interests to maximize company 
shareholder's value;

3) We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on 
shareholder's value;  we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users  
to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of 
regulatory support;

4) We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests; We  will 
select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests; 

5) In case Enron's interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we 
are part of, we will defend and express our interests individually; we will 
let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general 
view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately. 

6) As a consequence of the above, the first step is to have our own view. If 
we do not know what the right way is, any alternative may look equally good 
or bad.



10 Commandment list  - Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy 
Sector in Brazil

1) We want the Wholesale Energy Market (MAE) to operate effectively asap. We 
acknowledge that COEX, the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the 
last 2 years. The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum 
game issues have prevented COEX to be effective. We advocate professional, 
independent boards instead, as we do in most markets we participate 
worldwide. Informativo Regulat?rio # 3 represent our best view on the subject 
for Brazil;

2) Therefore, we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix, inter alia: 
(i) the ineffectiveness of COEX, by replacing it by COMAE, a professional 
board; (ii) introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement 
(COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years, which has resulted 
in a US$ 300 million default); (iii) we acknowledge that the Ordinances 
published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged; 
(iv) therefore, we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to 
enhance the governance of the new board, make MAE the organizational 
structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not 
overpenalize our long positions (loss sharing) ; (v) we will do  our best to 
convince our peers about the proposed changes: however, if the agreed level 
is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement, we will 
present our view to ANEEL separately; (vi) we will advocate that companies 
trading in the free market should have a non-discriminatory treatment within 
MAE and COMAE. (vii) we will  strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the 
free trading association.

3) We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot 
price, even during rationing. (in fact, already capped at about R$ 300/MWh, 
which represents the embedded cost of deficit). This conceptual view is 
perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro, Eletrobolt, and wholesale 
position - all of them long. We will strongly oppose any government 
temptation to set additional caps on spot prices. On the contrary, we will 
support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit, which we 
believe to be underestimated. We have recently supported, as strongly 
suggested by our trading group, ANEEL's proposal to significantly raise the 
cost of deficit, particularly during rationing. We advocate that any caps on 
spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will 
aggravate the rationing crisis.

4) We defend Contract sanctity. In this regard, we will fight with Aneel to 
have the pass-through of non-controllable costs for Elektro, such as power 
purchases costs. Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession 
contract, whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff 
reviews should not be recovered. We defend the idea of a tracking account or 
a similar mechanism. We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL, 
either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend 
our interests.

4) Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity, we will defend Annex V, which 
is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon 
rationing. According to several Elektro's analysis developed thus far, 
preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro, even 
able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing. If 
Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on 
the basis of actual load redution, as proposed in the rumor mill, we will 
forego US$ 60 million in terms of EBITDA. We will refuse to negotiate with 
our suppliers (e.g. Duke, AES) any changes in the Initial Contracts which 
entail any transfer of risk/costs between generators and distributors. We 
will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted 
to change the Annex V, under the assumption that contract sanctity is being 
violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty. We will 
also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing 
plan because of the "free ride" effect. We will not advocate any bail-out of 
companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the 
impact of Annex V when companies were privatized. We will argue that Annex V 
was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore 
there is not any excuse to  change the rules now. We will not agree to set 
additional caps on spot, not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is 
(which will represent about US$ 10 million to Elektro). (Caps are actually a 
disguised way of partially revoking Annex V)

5) We will support Aneel's Resolution 145, recently published, whereby any 
new generation (back-up, self generator), no matter its size, is allowed to 
sell to any market player, at freely negotiated prices (before they could 
sell to the host utility only). Similarly, we support any other initiative to 
give a non-discriminatory treatment to  new generation, which should be free 
to trade energy at freely negotiated basis.

6) We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand 
reduction during rationing. To avoid California's mistakes, we will advocate 
that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices. We will 
advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay 
of correct economic signals (MAE spot prices)  for those exceding their 
quotas. We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not 
provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource; nor it is 
effective for a long-term energy rationing (as opposed to California, where 
the issue was peak shaving). Furthermore, as recently pointed out by CERA, 
rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant 
departure from markets and will open new avenues for market  intervention and 
contract breaches. We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand 
elasticity in electricity prices. By linking the success of the rationing 
program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long 
positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro. We acknowledge that the increase 
in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the 
medium term. While the financial  impact  of energy rationing  has not been 
quantified for Elektro, we also assume the appetite for markets and energy 
services may create new business opportunities for Enron .

7) We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail 
competition in 2003 (proposed threshold level of 50 kW). We  do not accept a 
commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for 
distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail 
market. Instead, regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent 
distribution companies to become stranded, by sharing this burden among the 
captive and free market segments. California CTC is an example, but 
government should look at best practices.

8) We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to 
competition in the electricity market  (Informativo Regulat?rio # 1). We will 
also advocate for open access in the pipelines. We will express our contrary 
views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobr?s role as 
the sole gas supplier, in order to avoid effective competition in the natural 
gas.

9) We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to 
the government, able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term. We 
will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory 
risks faced by generators and distributors. We will express our views on how 
to create a healthy contracting environment,  to foster competition and 
expand capacity. We will oppose any measures which create a non-level playing 
field, both at the production or consumption side. If emergency actions are 
needed, they should be used on a temporary basis only (e.g. Petrobr?s' being 
the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge).

9) Finally, we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities 
and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to (or at least try 
to) get  the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry.  We 
acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and 
that  the competitive model has not worked. We will express our opposite 
views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead.  We acknowlege that it 
will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse parties/interests. 
COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was 
tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process. Given that, we 
should express our coherent, market based views to the Government. We will 
use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude 
strengthens our points of view. In case conflicts emerge, we will preserve 
the coherence of our ideas as a whole.

Allison and I had a good discussion with Boucher's telecom staffer/leg 
counsel, Johanna Mikes.  She hadn't heard the Enron/EBS story, so first 
provided that.

We then discussed the specifics of the cable issue, and learned from Johanna 
the following:

a) the bill will be introduced in Judiciary, not in Energy and Commerce 
b) this year's bill will not include any of the 251 sections which were 
contained in last year's legislation (and which I told her off-the-record 
would be a deal killer for Enron)

She accepted our suggestions that the language as currently written covers 
only broadcasters, ie, those who already have some access to the cable 
platform.  I suggested they include provisions that cable operators not 
discriminate against non-affiliated video programming and other ITV content, 
and further that they not discriminate against this type of content delivered 
via the internet.  She accepted these suggestions.

Boucher will now draft new language and share it with us.  After we 
comment/sign-off, they'll approach Bob Goodlatte for co-sponsorship and 
buy-in.  Disney and others will play high profile roles as well.

Boucher very much wants Enron's support on this -- and given the openness 
with which our comments were received, as well as the fact that they will 
withdraw the damaging 251 clauses and make this a focused cable access bill, 
I would suggest you relay our full support and appreciation to Boucher when 
you see him next week.

We have just learned that AEP is agreeing to construct the Dumont Substation 
in Northern Indiana (which we argued for in the Michigan transmission case): 
however, much of the capacity made available has been reserved with rollover 
rights:

1.  Duke has purchased 416mw beginning the summer of 2002.  It is to provide 
transmission from two Duke merchant plants into MECS (we think to serve a 
utility).

2. Exelon has purchased 500MW for transmission into Com Ed (east to west) for 
2001-2002 under a special tariff arrangement which results in alternative 
higher pricing.

For those following the Michigan case, Kerry will be drafting our brief in 
which we will argue that to extent the transmission capacity is not being 
used to serve competitive retail load, this should not count towards the 
2000mw of increased capacity as required by the dereg statute.

For those covering Com Ed, this bolsters the info we have received regarding 
Com Ed's concern about having adequate capacity.

Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
"greenwashing."   We have an already-published public "statement" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider "positive" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or "we don't care" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about "Kyoto." 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Jeff

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Press Release

Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for 
Solutions

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees 
with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company 
as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders.

Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated 
attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing 
the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More 
importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's 
supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If 
anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and 
uncertainty that have further destabilized the market.

``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations 
and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob 
Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale 
Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, 
not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions 
that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the 
perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on 
providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the 
outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's 
office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued 
quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still 
waiting on a response.''

Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the 
lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being ``obstructionist'':

Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels 
since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from 
these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far 
exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison.

Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants 
to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In 
addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment 
and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum.

For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities 
and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of 
relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell 
power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural 
gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power.

Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns 
that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a 
major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless 
payment was forthcoming.

Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage 
businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the 
Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states 
to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a 
dialogue on the program.

``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the 
governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this 
request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first 
time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the 
purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.''

Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are 
unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our 
commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and 
worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all 
investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that 
we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

Addressing the Energy Deficit:
A Conflict of Visions
May 9, 2001

Dear Republican Colleague,

For the last eight years, we have had no coherent energy policy.
Former-Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson said last year in response to
rising gasoline prices, "We were caught off guard.  We were asleep at the
wheel."  Well it's time to wake up, and I think the Bush-Cheney
Administration is ringing the alarm bell.

        As we get into the debate over how to get out of this energy
deficit, it is important to remember that Democrats have long advocated high
prices to curtail your energy consumption.   Remember the Btu Tax?  I do.
The current crisis is the culmination of both a neglect of real energy
solutions and a concrete plan to restrict supply and drive up prices. 

This summer is the Democrat energy ideal, because it forces you out of your
car, to turn off your air-conditioning, and to dramatically change your
energy consumption habits.   Their plan calls for a fuel quota for SUV's!
To me, this exemplifies the difference between their vision and ours.

*       We're for modern technology solutions, abundant and affordable
energy, streamlining and innovation. 
*       They're for rationing energy, more government control, scarcity and
excessive sacrifice.

*       We're for newer, cleaner, more abundant sources of energy to fuel
our high tech economy.  Even traditional fuels like oil and gas can be
derived more safely, more cleanly, more efficiently.
*       They're for controlling your consumption and imposing new government
mandates on energy.

*       We're looking to the future and looking at comprehensive, reality
based solutions to a long-term problem.
*        They're stuck in the past and looking for Jimmy Carter solutions
that led to gas lines, stagflation and malaise.

To me the choice is clear.  We can recognize that we have a real problem and
look to real solutions, or we can stick our head in the sand, slap on a few
band-aids and falsely claim to have "solved the problem."  I choose the
former.

                                        Sincerely,



                                        DICK ARMEY

On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
upgrades once the delivery service begins.

Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.

Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for 
transmission away from the generator.

Rick, 

As I understand it, you wanted our wish list of what we would like (within 
the confines of Enron).  Here's my wish list:

1.  The business units within Enron are very segmented and that can prevent 
the cross-pollination of solutions for customers.  For example, if we could 
put together a program that linked commodity sales for a variety of customer 
sizes of load with load control devices and the offering of curtailable 
products, it would create a mechanism to 1) provide savings/income to 
customers during peak periods, 2)make power available to Enron during peak 
periods for resale and 3) help modulate the potential for outages and 
insufficient capacity.   The packaging of other energy efficiency services 
could also be considered in conjunction with this.

2. Coupled with and also apart from suggestion #1 above, Enron should 
increase its marketing of renewable products.  By doing so it would 1)work in 
hand with a curtailable program, by freeing up generation during a hot peak 
day - if photovoltaics are used, 2)enhance Enron's image in the community, 
3)serve a market niche.

3.  Have the opportunity to add two more wishes.

4. Coupled with and apart from suggestions #1 and 2 above, Enron should focus 
more on distributed generation alternatives which can 1) provide significant 
savings to customers since in many states stranded costs are not assessed on 
DG, 2) can be used as a source of energy during a peak period by paying the 
customer a premium to curtail and make the power available to Enron to sell 
on the market 3) help offset the problem of delivering power into a 
constrained control area where there is dg power we can tap into.

5. Create a forum within government affairs to collectively brainstorm and 
develop strategies to implement the needs of Enron's business units.  Clear 
identification of the goals and problem solving not only provide good 
solutions through the contribution of diverse viewpoints, but it is also an 
excellent learning experience for all participants as a clearer understanding 
of the goals emerge.  Also, participants can take with them a better 
understanding of what may be achievable, while others may  pick up ideas that 
can be reshaped and used in their jurisdictions.  

I hope this is in line with what you were looking for.  If not, please let me 
know and I'll ask for three more wishes.
Janine

In a 48-page opinion issued on March 12, United States District Court Judge 
Andre Davis granted EFSI's motion for summary judgment and dismissed BG&E's 
lawsuit.  BG&E was seeking a ruling that nonregulated companies should not be 
permitted to provide utilty services to federal armed services bases located 
within state territory.  Along with Friday's dismissal of the Colorado suit 
brought by Colorado State Utilities, this should end this threat to EFSI's 
business.  The only judicial challenge that remains is the lawsuit filed by 
Virginia Power at the Federal Court of Claims, and the issue in that lawsuit 
relates solely to bundling.  Moreover, there is language in Judge Davis' 
decision (on the non-retroactivity of the October Hexley amendments to 
section 2688) that, if followed by the Federal Court of Claims, will be 
dispositive of that issue as well.

The Venable firm, primarily Jim Shea and Mitch Mirviss, did an outstanding 
job briefing and arguing this case.  However, as the Judge noted in his 
decision, had Congress passed the House version of the Hexley amendment, the 
Judge would have been obliged to rule in BG&E's favor.  Cynthia Sandherr and 
Bob Frank are responsible for getting the language changed in conference so 
that it ended up helping, not defeating, our case.

I will let you know if BG&E appeals.

Please call me with any questions.  Thank you.

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

I was asked to keep my mouth shut. 

But I am still looking forward  to celebrating 5 victories in a row

1) Itaipu excess energy belonging to D/Rs
2) Changing MAE governance
3) Quotas with economic signals as opposed to rolling black-outs
4) No changes in Annex V
5) No caps on spot prices

Decisions on the last two ones should be made shortly. 

I may have left some enemies behind, but I leave with the sense of having 
fulfilled my mission.

Subject: Re: Renunciando a ABRACEEL  

Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  

Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.

When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.

But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the "policy makers" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  

In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 

Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out 
so that you can provide assistance from the USA.

Thank you for your perseverance on this long fight.

Jose

This is an ad created for use in the Ontario market and would include the 
logos of the signatory companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck 
Dadson worked with GPC on its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which 
includes Ken Lay's visit to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government 
leaders.

Give me your thoughts.

Jeff:
 I have seen your note to Kate with final proposed letter attached. Thanks 
for taking on board some of our suggestions. Let me note however:
 1. A typo which we missed before in the last line of second para. - "taken" 
should read "undertaken" (you can't "take" an activity!)
 2. Disappointment from my point of view that vagueness has crept back into 
the third paragraph. (If I am to be designated a spokesman for Enron in 
Europe on this issue, even on a restricted, strictly reactive basis, I will 
need to know what some of the words and phrases are meant to indicate. The 
question of whether or not we support the creation of binding international 
commitments entered into by governments has, for instance, been avoided.) The 
Q and A will need imaginative crafting to address the lack of clarity in the 
letter itself.
 Your note implies the original English language text approved is necessarily 
the text to be used for all replies, with only local "cover letters". Such an 
approach will give local offices of Greenpeace in Europe an impression of a 
very US-centric approach. Have you considered the alternative of a local 
translation of the full letter, signed by an Enron Europe executive? (I do 
not necessarily advocate this approach, but welcome comment also from those 
copied.)

Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and 
apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and 
Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a 
comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). 

In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides 
more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly 
challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much 
more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. 

That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the 
plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of 
August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough 
time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in 
time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant 
energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides 
refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  
This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and 
now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.

Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting 
the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as 
soon as I have more information on that.

Best,
Jeff

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that 
puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the 
CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, 
until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in 
Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have 
agreed with the new timetable.

Jim,

I am leaving a binder of material for you with Lucy that includes all of the 
correspondence to date with Verizon.  While you should not feel obliged to 
read all of it by any means, I have tabbed several summaries of meetings or 
calls that we had which might give you a better idea of how obstructive 
Verizon has been thus far; to that extent, I have highlighted certain 
passages as well.  However, I would encourage you to read the June 14th 
letter that we sent to Jeff Masoner (VP of Interconnection Services of 
Verizon Services Corp.) as it provides a general summary of our 
correspondence with Verizon.  The letter is included in the binder.

The critical issues for us are as follows:

1. Verizon has not provided an answer as to whether it will provide terms, 
conditions and prices for OC-3, 12 and 48 loops and OC-48 transport for 
inclusion in an interconnection agreement or supplemental agreement/amendment.

2. Verizon has not provided us with the relevant loop and transport rates for 
the seven states where we seek interconnection (MA, NJ, NY, DC, VA, PA and 
CA).  We sent them specific information regarding central office locations, 
CLLI codes, and mileage for the 7 states, however, in response to their 
request for this information in order to provide us with corresponding rates.

In addition, nobody from Verizon has responded to the letter that we sent to 
Jeff Masoner, nor have any of the deadlines that were set forth in the letter 
been met (e.g., answer inquiry #1 above by June 20th; answer inquiry #2 by 
July 11th).  Please note that there are other issues that still need to be 
discussed and resolved, and a list of those questions is included in the 
binder.  It is my hope that, in the course of mediation, the NY Commission 
would assist us with negotiating all of our issues.

I have asked Lucy to schedule a call for you with Paul Lacouture (President, 
Network Services Group, Verizon Communications) to occur on Monday, July 
16th.  She is in the process of doing so.  Paul Racicot, Stewart Seeligson, 
and Frank Bay are aware of our desire to file for mediation with the NY 
Commission subsequent to your call with Lacouture;  Sue and I will be 
discussing this with Everett on Friday morning.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  Although I will be 
traveling, I will check messages and my cell number is 713-851-7770 if you 
need to reach me.  Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
Lara

ISO New England and PJM Interconnection Propose a
Standard Market Design for Wholesale Electricity Markets

March 29, 2001 - HOLYOKE, MA -  Two of the country's leading wholesale
electricity market administrators, ISO New England Inc. and PJM
Interconnection, L.L.C., together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation, a systems
developer for electric utilities, today announce their intent to formalize
an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets, but
will lead, they believe, to the standardization of wholesale electricity
markets across the country.

Today, ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), enclosing a report
concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines
salient features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing
wholesale market design.  The combination would create a standardized
wholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale
electricity markets ("Standard Market Design").

ISO New England, ALSTOM ESCA and PJM, acting through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, PJM Technologies Inc., have agreed to proceed with the
negotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing
PJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM.
The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized
market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common
solution to unit dispatch.

"This new market standard should put into place the necessary market
improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement
a customized market system for New England," said William W. Berry, Chairman
and Acting CEO of ISO New England.  "Now is the time to stop the
experimentation.  Ultimately, we hope the Standard Market Design will serve
as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country,
if not around the world."

"PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive
wholesale electricity market," said Phillip G. Harris, Chairman and CEO of
PJM. "Along with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept,
this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design."

This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers
across different markets and promote FERC's goal of creating a seamless
marketplace.  "We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issues
of mutual importance," stated Mr. Berry.  "This new market design, together
with our efforts to address the market "seams" and other coordination
issues, will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer
together."  ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to work
together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January
16, 2001.

"Because of our geographic location, New York is in the center of the
Northeast markets, with ISO New England, PJM and IMO each on one of our
borders.  We support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeast
trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will
benefit," said William J. Museler, President and CEO of the New York
Independent System Operator. "The New York ISO will continue to work with
our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and
to move towards larger regional markets."

This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with
stakeholder input. ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design
to the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New
England Power Pool in a series of meetings next week.  Additional meetings
will be conducted in the next few weeks. The Standard Market Design for New
England will be subject to FERC approval.

"Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a
market's efficiency.  A market that moderates price fluctuations and
encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market --
and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity," said Alain
Steven, CEO of ALSTOM ESCA.  "In the future, this agreement will be viewed
as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets."

ISO New England Inc. is the not-for-profit corporation responsible for the
day-to-day reliable operation of New England's bulk generation and
transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26,000 megawatts.
In addition to operating the bulk power grid, ISO New England is the
administrator of the region's wholesale electricity marketplace and the Open
Access Transmission Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool. ISO New
England is based in Holyoke, Massachusetts.

The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., is an Independent System Operator,
administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJM
Energy Markets and Capacity Markets. PJM currently administers the largest
wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than
200. It is headquartered in Norristown, Pennsylvania. PJM Technologies, Inc.
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., designed to
respond to market opportunities by bringing cost-effective, reliable
solutions to the energy marketplace. It was created to commercialize PJM's
knowledge capital, experience, and proven success in electric energy
markets, system operations, and applications development.

		 Subject: Market Opening Position 

Eric, we are pretty sure the announcement will be that they will open the 
market by May 2002.  Today, senior political and bureaucratic staff in the 
Ministry of Energy have gone out of their way to stress that the announcement 
is designed to leave open the  real possibility of an earlier opening (i.e. 
in November 2001) if that is feasible.   As matters stand, I think that our 
response should be: a) We are pleased by the reaffirmation of the gov'ts 
intention to move forward with competition in the Ontario power market; b) 
our understanding of the position is that it leaves open the  real 
possibility of opening the market earlier, such as of November 1, 2001;  c) 
we continue to believe that an opening in November  2001 is feasible and in 
the best interests of Ontario (for the reasons set forth in Ken Lay's speech) 
; and  d) accordingly, we will continue to work towards a November opening 
and we encourage all others in the market  to do the 
same.                      Peter Varley of GPC is going to give you a call.

Sharon -- Rick has agreed that if Sandra choose COBRA medical coverage, Enron 
will pay her premiums for the 18 month period.  I need a letter/document that 
I can send to Sandra to note this.  When Sandra applies for COBRA coverage, 
there is a section that asks for Billing Information.  In that section, she 
would put 
Enron Corporation
Attn:  Jo Ann Hill, Corp Human Resources, EB 1665d
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

I think we should also put some verbiage in the letter that states upon 
enrollment in any other comparable medical coverage, she must notify us so 
COBRA coverage can be stopped.

Please let me know if you need any further information regarding this and 
when I would be able to get this letter.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

A couple of things you might be able to use for Steve. Unfortunately, no time 
to convert to slides, but
this should provide enough raw material for you.

Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

Rick - 

I just got off the phone with Lisa and she proposes to reduce her travel 
budget by 10%; Lisa's current travel budget is $120,000.  The savings equals 
$12,000.  Lisa said she spoke to you yesterday regarding her outside services 
budget.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

RE:  Denmark Approves Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
DATE: May 30, 2001
______________________________________________________________________________
_________
Yesterday, the Danish Parliament passed a resolution approving the Kyoto 
Protocol, allowing Denmark to ratify the treaty jointly with other EU member 
states.  Denmark is the first EU member to take such strong government action 
related to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.  Currently, Romania is the 
only industrialized nation to have ratified the treaty.  
While Denmark's action is largely symbolic, it puts pressure on the U.S. and 
other EU members to keep the international negotiations on track and puts 
mild pressure on other EU members to approve the treaty in preparation for 
joint ratification.
Please see Dow Jones article below.
Background
The Bush Administration is currently reviewing U.S. climate change policy 
with the aim of releasing an alternative approach to the Kyoto Protocol in 
late June.  The international climate change negotiations are scheduled to 
resume in mid-July in Bonn, Germany, but could be postponed based on the 
substance of the U.S. plan or a lack of progress during informal Ministerial 
meetings in late June.  
EU Ministers have publicly endorsed a EU ratification strategy by 2002; 
however, U.S. opposition to the treaty could delay or shift this approach.
Environmental Strategies is providing input to the Bush Administration and 
Congress on cost-effective, market-based approaches to address climate change.
Remarks by Danish Energy Minister
Danish Energy Minister Svend Auken made these remarks about ratification:
"Denmark is sending a strong signal that we still support the Kyoto Protocol, 
affirming our active contribution to protecting the environment we live in."
"It is even more important in light of the American rejection," he continued, 
"for countries that support the Kyoto Protocol to show clearly that the Kyoto 
process is continuing." 
I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.
Please see the Dow Jones article and link to the Agence France-Presse story 
below  (in French).

Denmark Approves Ratification Of Kyoto Climate Treaty

05/30/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COPENHAGEN (AP)--The Danish parliament has approved the 1997 Kyoto
global warming treaty in a move the environment minister called a strong
signal to the U.S. administration that the ratification process will
continue despite rejection by President George W. Bush.

In an 88-9 vote late Tuesday, the parliament in Copenhagen gave its
go-ahead for European Union member Denmark to ratify the protocol when
all 15 E.U. members jointly will sign the document. No date for the
common ratification has been set.

"In light of the American government's rejection of the Kyoto agreement,
it's even more important that the countries that support it clearly
demonstrate that the Kyoto process continues," Environment Minister
Svend Auken said Wednesday by telephone.

The U.S. has been heavily criticized for its environmental policies
after Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty in March, saying the mandatory
pollution reductions would harm American economic interests and
promising to offer alternative measures.

In Kyoto, Japan, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2% by 2012 from 1990 levels.

Auken stressed the importance of maintaining a dialogue with the U.S. -
the world's biggest polluter - on environmental matters.

"The way forward is not to take a defensive position but to show
leadership," he said. "Without the E.U. it is difficult to imagine a
successful global climate policy that will really make a real difference
to the environment."

E.U. leaders have pledged to go forward with the ratification process
despite the U.S. rejection and say it's possible to get the necessary
approval from 55 countries.

World delegations will reconvene in Bonn, Germany, in July for another
attempt to draft details of the treaty.

Two weeks ago, EPSA had a FERC Outreach meeting with FERC's Office of Markets 
Rates and Tariffs staff to discuss issues of importance to EPSA members.  Jim 
Steffes attended the meeting on behalf of Enron.  During the meeting, one of 
the issues raised was the lack of comparable transmission service between 
network and point to point service.  Several staffers (including Don Gelinas) 
expressed interest in ways that FERC could address this comparability 
problem.   After the meeting, Julie Simon met with Andrea Wolfman (head of 
Market Oversight) and Andrea also expressed an interest in the issue.

Julie scheduled a meeting with Andrea and Ginny Strasser for today for EPSA 
members.  I attended the meeting, along with representatives from Williams, 
Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, and Reliant.   We told Andrea and Ginny that now that 
FERC has issued its order on California, it's time to focus on the rest of 
the country, and we have real problems, one being lack of comparable 
transmission service -- namely, that utilities have network service and we 
have point to point service.  

While a lot of the conversation was based on generators' problems in 
interconnecting to the grid (due to the problems with using point to point 
rather than network service), we also discussed that this is a problem for 
all transmission customers, not just generators.  Andrea asked if providing 
some kind of new "Network Plus" type of service would also require 
elimination of the native load exception.  We explained that while the native 
load exception must be eliminated,  there is still a need for a Network Plus 
type service because network is a superior service to point to point, and 
utilities will still have access to this superior service, even when the 
native load exception is eliminated.  The point of this meeting was not to 
ask FERC to deal with the native load issue in this meeting -- Julie felt 
that because Don Gelinas expressed interest in solving the network problem, 
that we should respond to his interest, rather than trying to get our entire 
agenda passed all at once.

Andrea seemed receptive to our ideas and suggested that we need to educate 
FERC staff.  She also noted that if the Commissioners make this a priority of 
theirs, that FERC staff will be much more willing to learn the issue and find 
a way to solve the problem.  

EPSA is going to work on a position paper on this new type of service.  At 
the Function 8 (seams issues) Technical Conference yesterday, both Pat Wood 
and Nora Brownell were interested in the comparability issue and ways to 
address it.   So, we need to get the Commissioners on board with the idea 
(Massey is already there, which he indicated in his concurrence in the 
Entergy Source and Sink order) and begin to educate FERC staff.  

Please let me know if you have any comments or ideas.  I will circulate the 
EPSA draft position paper once I receive it.

the idea that Kevin had for an RTO-group.  (Rick--Jim and I talked about 
these on the phone today).

Presidents Bush (Former and Current) Speak on Energy Issues 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]Introduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corp.'s CEO Chris Hamilos, 
President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this 
morning at the 25th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque, N.M. The 
41st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective 
about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career, and 
reiterated his strong support for his son, President George W. Bush, whom he 
affectionately refers to as "43" (as in 43rd president). 

The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his 
retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy. 
However, the former president did field questions from the audience regarding 
a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he 
faced in his administration, and those that are presently challenging his 
son. Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current 
president's just-released energy task plan, a 165-page report that outlines 
approximately 105 steps that the new administration will take to address 
current energy problems. 

Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues 
during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia. The former 
president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against 
Saddam Hussein, who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world. 
Further, President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his 
presidency, during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress "that saw 
the big picture issues in a different light" often made it difficult to find 
common ground.  

The former president made only brief (but rather significant) references to 
his son's new energy policy. Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney 
last evening, former President Bush said he was aware that the new, 
broad-based plan focused heavily on new supply, along with secondary measures 
for conservation efforts. This is an approach that the former president fully 
supports as he noted that "if you want to lower energy prices, you need to 
establish more supply." In addition, the former president offered that 
additional drilling efforts, an element of the plan that has sparked a great 
deal of controversy, "has to happen" if the nation is truly committed to 
increasing supply. However, former President Bush did suggest that the nation 
must be patient as it will take "several years" to see any significant 
decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new 
development efforts. 

Meanwhile, the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this 
morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate. As 
expected, the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil 
in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, easing of clean-air rules that 
should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit 
process for oil refinery expansion and construction. These platforms have 
been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan.  

However, new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few 
days are raising the most eyebrows. For instance, the extent to which nuclear 
power factors into the administration's energy plan is perhaps greater than 
was previously anticipated. Specifically, the Bush plan proposes the 
extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of so-called 
"breeder reactors," which use spent nuclear fuel. Breeder reactors, although 
rather common in Europe and Japan, have not been used in the United States 
since the 1970s, when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce 
nuclear weapon-grade plutonium as a by-product.  

Other key elements of the plan include:  

Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government, which would 
supersede states' rights to approve new transmission line capacity. 
Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants.  
Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting, and speeding up the 
relicensing requirements for nuclear plants. 
Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury, which 
are common by-products of coal-fired production. In turn, the Bush 
administration supports exploring new clean-coal technologies, which should 
increase production by coal-fired generating plants. 
A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air 
Act, which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power 
plants. The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted 
or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued. 

As has been the case since the start of the new administration, the 
continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and 
strong on new supply efforts, while remaining vague and noncommittal to 
conservation efforts. However, the specific conservation proposals in the 
energy plan include providing consumers $4 billion in tax credits through 
2007 to encourage the purchase of high-mileage, gas-electric hybrid vehicles. 
In addition, President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to 
co-generation plants, which produce both heat and electricity. Others, 
including the current president's father, might argue that conservation 
efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as 
market forces (high prices) already are driving renewed conservation across 
the country.  

Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that 
often thwarted his policy measures, the current President Bush continues to 
buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy 
plan. In fact, just two days ago, a group of House Democrats led by House 
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Miss.) outlined a plan that calls for 
increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas 
(both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan). However, Democrats have 
focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan, as 
illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy 
efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles. 
Consequently, the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties, 
although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and 
Democrats to support cooperation in Congress. That cooperation may be 
necessary as Congress must approve President Bush's energy plan in order for 
it to take effect.

SBX 27 (Bowen), regarding direct access, failed passage on the Senate floor
on a vote of 23-11 (the bill has an urgency clause and requires 27 votes).
Senator Peace was the only Democrat to vote against the bill.  Senator Peace
spoke against the bill for five minutes during which time he, in a very
emotional state, blamed Enron for the energy crisis, claimed Enron's version
of direct access means only small customers pay for lines and other similar
charges, is trying to ruin the Japanese energy market, is running the
proceedings in Washington where it has already admitted its guilt, and is
looking for another opportunity to steal from California consumers.  Two
Republicans spoke against the bill but their comments more or less focused
on DWR's contracts.  One Republican tried to insert a hostile amendment in
the bill to establish a version of the windfall profits tax on municipal
utilities.  The amendment failed passage on a party-line vote with the
exception of a vote in support from Senator Peace.

In her close, Senator Bowen indicated that the viability of direct access
would be tied to amount of power purchased by DWR.  She characterized DWR's
contracts as outrageous, but expected, given that they were purchased in
duress out of sheer necessity.  Senator Bowen did request reconsideration of
the measure.

Jim asked me to send to you the attached filing we submitted in the three 
northeast RTO dockets (PJM, New York and New England) urging FERC to 
consolidate the three RTOs into one based on the PJM market design structure.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's 
comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen 
from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief "Letter to the 
Editor" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of 
the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New 
York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing 
so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter 
is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not 
as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki 
or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.  John

Priggish and piggish in California

Mark Steyn
National Post
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but 
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's 
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South 
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, 
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio 
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, 
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island 
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's 
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside 
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's 
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New 
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, 
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact 
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British 
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when 
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been 
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the 
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green, 
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in 
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were 
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the 
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return 
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was 
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and 
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its 
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for 
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.) 
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best 
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a 
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it 
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush 
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California 
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in 
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of 
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of 
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio 
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in 
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio 
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the 
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000 
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but 
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis 
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming 
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California. 
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And 
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By 
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that 
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're 
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at 
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power 
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber 
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO 
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's 
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence 
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make 
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr. 
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in 
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of 
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction: 
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living 
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery, 
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a 
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price 
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another 
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one 
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic 
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build 
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's 
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a 
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office. 
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching 
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to 
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price 
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy 
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those 
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service 
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public 
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable," 
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps, 
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members 
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean, 
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in 
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every 
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a 
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the 
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about 
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just 
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable 
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just 
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century 
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its 
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than 
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an 
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly 
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own, 
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous, 
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world 
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to 
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

Steve and Rick - In response to your question regarding the European 
allocation, here are responses on the Keeler and Worthen allocations.  These 
were the only two that Europe had required backup on when receiving the 
allocation.  Mike - By copy of this note, can you provide backup on the 
Europe allocation for your cost center, Henry's, and Marc's?  Thanks!

Elizabeth,
My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing 
services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the 
corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of 
acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility 
initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit 
allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management 
systems, and historical use.

Please let me know if any additional questions arise.

Thanks,

Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time 
for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso 
and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 
towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and 
will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our 
current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global 
markets, including:

Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to 
commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and 
worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and 
identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects 
include:
Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation
Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter
Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset 
trading, environmental disclosure/labeling
Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, 
i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely 
with government affairs & public affairs units.     Maintain ongoing 
relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective 
coalitions with industry organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on 
behalf of Enron businesses.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.

FYI - Yesterday, I attended a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on climate 
change and climate science.  It gave some indications on what might be 
included in Bush's domestic plan to address climate change.
 
While little new ground was covered, consensus was evident on the following 
actions:

? focus on no-regrets and inexpensive reduction opportunities (energy 
efficiency, "low-hanging fruit")
? take steps to reduce emissions that have co-benefits (air quality - SOx, 
NOx emissions reductions)
? improve scientific modeling
? long-term research/development and deployment of new technologies, 
including renewables 
? think about adaptation strategies

This was a conservative response, but a sound foundation.  This is likely the 
message being relayed to the White House climate change task force and 
reflects the minimum options under consideration for Bush's domestic 
approach.  

These recommendations are consistent with Enron's positions and ideas we have 
already been feeding the Administration such as our multipollutant proposal 
-- which is market-based, encourages new generation, and has a circuit 
breaker to keep costs down.  We can also help the White House craft 
meaningful proposals on energy efficiency and incentives for new technologies.

I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.

Below is a rough estimate of the book impact if ComEd succeeds in ending PPO 
early.  That is, if they terminate PPO starting Jan. 2005 it should cost us 
$1.2m, if they want to terminate Jan. 2004 it would be an impact of $3.1m 
($1.2m for 2005 + $1.9m for 2004), etc.



These costs can be reduced with a liquid market for wholesale power and 
ancillary services.

Let's discuss our suggested changes.

Subject: Com Ed

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

SJM to mobilise retired army officers

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) would marshal a battery of retired army 
officials to raise the banner of revolt against the government's decision for 
privatisation of the defence sector. 
The SJM is expecting to mobilise support of retired senior army officials in 
order to drive home the point that the decision to privatise and allow FDI in 
defence production was "anti-national". These officials would lead the dharna 
from July 25 outside Parliament, sources in the SJM say.
After its council meeting at Shimla, the SJM is preparing to launch a 
full-blown attack against the government for pursuing its policies of 
economic liberalisation and globalisation. "The decision to hold a three-day 
agitation during the monsoon session of Parliament is intended to convey the 
message that the SJM would continue its struggle," said a senior 
office-bearer. The Swadeshi faction within the Sangh Parivar appears buoyed 
by the fact that the council had adopted four resolutions which approved the 
SJM's struggle against the Enron project, WTO and the government's decision 
to privatise the defence productions. 
Sources in the SJM maintain that given the resolutions passed by the council, 
it was unlikely that the RSS leadership would intervene and ask the SJM to 
mend its ways. "In the Bangalore meeting with the RSS leadership, a broad 
consensus was evolved that all RSS-affiliated organisations were free to 
chalk out their own course of actions and the RSS would not intervene," they 
said. 
Obviously, the SJM has been bracing up for a confrontation with the 
government in major economic issues by putting up BMS founder and senior RSS 
leader Dattopant Thengadi in front to criticise the government.

States cannot afford DPC power

The Centre's initiative towards facilitating sale of power from the Enron
-promoted Dabhol project in Maharashtra to other states is likely to come a 
cropper. 
Sources told Business Standard that the states would in no way be able to 
purchase power from Dabhol Power Company (DPC) as it would be difficult to 
lower the tariff to Rs 3 per unit. "No state will be able to buy power from 
DPC at a rate above Rs 3 per unit considering the rate at which they are 
supplying power to the consumers at present," said a source in the Central 
Electricity Authority (CEA).
Power minister Suresh Prabhu had only last week asked CEA to consult the 
power-deficient neighbouring states of Maharashtra seeking their views on the 
requirement and tariff at which they would be able to buy electricity from 
DPC. 
Sources said that states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Goa, to which 
DPC could supply power, were not in a position to buy it at a cost which was 
more than what they spend at present. 
They pointed out that even after a considerable reduction in tariff, it was 
highly unlikely that DPC would sell power to these states at the rates 
affordable by them. 
As for the other states, transmission cost would only add up to the already 
high cost of Dabhol power. Hence, the proposition is almost ruled out, said 
sources. 
They said that the unit cost of power for all SEBs was around Rs 3 at 
present. Interestingly, the average tariff of all the SEBs was estimated to 
be 208 paise per unit in 1999-2000, at a 74 per cent tariff to cost ratio. 
In 1999-2000, the unit cost of power supply in Gujarat was 287.30 paise, and 
in Madhya Pradesh, it was 252.72 paise. Maharashtra had 254.36 paise per unit 
cost of power supply in 1999-2000. 
Sources said that the the existing tariff structure and supply cost was a 
clear indication why third party sale had not been allowed by the states even 
though Section 43 of the Indian Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 allowed such 
sale. 
They added that the chances of states allowing third-party sale by the 
independent power producers in the light of the DPC-MSEB controversy was 
remote. The Centre has asked the states to allow third-party sale from the 
IPPs.

Dabhol lenders to study pullout cost

Lenders to the Dabhol Power project have mandated their engineer, Stone and 
Webster, to do a costing study on the implications of mothballing the second 
phase of the project. The issue is whether to close it now or wait till the 
civil work on the project is over. 
Enron has made it clear that it wants to pull out of the second phase unless 
issues relating to the power purchase agreement are resolved and the 
government of India makes a firm commitment on the offtake of power.
IDBI executive director RS Agarwal, who was present at the two-day lenders' 
meeting in Singapore, told Business Standard that the institutional lenders 
will discuss the report of the engineers before deciding on a further course 
of action. 
The second phase is 92 per cent complete. Total completion would entail the 
finalisation of the power blocks and the LNG facility. Incidentally, the 
trial run of the first block of the second phase_740 mw was to have taken 
place today, but failed to happen on account of the legal battle between DPC 
and MSEB. 
To date, more than $1,570 million has been invested in the second phase. 
Stone & Webster's report will identify how much additional funds the lenders 
would have to plough in depending upon whether the project is shelved 
immediately or after completion of construction activity. It will also figure 
out the funds required to restart the project. 
"The legal position of the two parties - DPC and MSEB - has complicated the 
issue," said Agarwal. Foreign lenders are reportedly unconvinced about the 
Indian government's seriousness in resolving the issue. 
Lenders have expressed anxiety over the suspension of power offtake by the 
MSEB, as this has affected the $50 million cash flow. The priority is for the 
two sides to resolve the issue through negotiations at the earliest. DPC 
ought to take the initiative as it is at the receiving end, said industry 
sources.

Enron Introduces Price Hedging for Memory Chips
By Bob Sechler

06/07/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
HOUSTON, Texas -- Dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAM, have 
long been viewed as the pork bellies of the computer industry, commodities 
whose prices swing widely based on supply and demand.
Enron Corp. (ENE) is taking the analogy a step further by enabling DRAM 
manufacturers and consumers, such as computer companies, to engage in the 
same price hedging strategies deployed in industries that depend on 
traditional commodities. 
The company has launched a lot program to buy and sell DRAM chips based on 
forward contracts, and it says an average of 25,000 standard 128-megabit DRAM 
chips a week were traded through its system during the first quarter, the 
initial quarter for active trading. That is a small amount relative to the 
overall world-wide DRAM market, estimated at $32 billion last year, but it's 
a start. 
"The [DRAM] chip market is a boom-or-bust cycle, with prices very high or 
very low," said Kenneth Wang, director of Enron's global semiconductor group. 
"It's the perfect market. And Enron has the credibility." 
Enron is no stranger to making markets. The company, once a stodgy natural 
gas pipeline operator, has evolved into a major commodity marketer and 
trader, dealing in everything from energy products to chemicals and Internet 
bandwidth capacity. 
Chip industry players and observers are intrigued by the DRAM effort, 
although many remain skeptical. Most point out that the potential for a DRAM 
futures market has been discussed for years with little to show for it. 
"All of the PC companies I know of would love to have an effective hedge" 
against DRAM price swings, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Dan Niles said. 
Every computer contains at least one of the chips, and many contain multiple 
chips, making DRAM chips among the top component expenses for computer 
makers. Other products, such as automobiles and digital cameras, use the 
memory chips as well. 
At present, DRAM chips are sold through direct contracts with manufacturers, 
such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Samsung Electronics Co., and through 
a spot market, where the price fluctuates daily. There is no independent 
exchange for DRAM futures that would allow manufacturers of the chips or 
their consumers to hedge against unexpected price swings. 
Challenges to forward trading in DRAM have proved daunting. DRAM isn't quite 
uniform, although it's considered the closest thing to a commodity in the 
computer industry. Many different configurations of the same basic chip 
exist, depending on the needs of the customer. 
DRAM prices have fallen over time -- about 30% a year over the past 25 years 
as manufacturing costs have declined -- despite short-term fluctuations. 
Memory-chip prices have fallen steeply this year because of weak computer 
demand. Standard 128-megabit chips have been selling recently for about $2.40 
on the spot market, off almost 50% since February. 
Technical innovation always has the potential to render existing DRAM 
varieties obsolete, which would open the door to additional risk for the 
holder of a forward buy contract. 
Nonetheless, some major industry players are watching Enron's effort closely. 
Officials at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), a leading consumer of DRAM chips, 
think the effort has merit and could work. Compaq hasn't made any DRAM 
purchases through Enron yet but remains receptive to the idea. 
The trend of falling DRAM prices "happens on a macro level, but there have 
been years when the price has increased 50% or 100%, and it happens in a very 
quick period of time," said Jack Baikie, Compaq's vice president of corporate 
procurement. "It's not a predictable cost curve" in the short-term. 
This year's declining prices likely would reverse quickly upon some signal 
that PC demand was rebounding, he said. A forward trading market "could 
provide us the ability to anticipate market trends and do some no-risk, or 
minimal-risk, hedging," Mr. Baikie said. 
Mr. Baikie dismisses the notion that DRAM isn't a commodity. "A memory chip 
is a memory chip," he said, with the only difference being how an individual 
consumer elects to configure and use it. 
Micron, one of the top DRAM manufacturers, also is receptive to the idea of a 
forward trading market. But Micron spokesman Kipp Bedard cautioned that the 
technical variations of DRAM, combined with continuing innovation, aren't 
insignificant issues and have proved to be a problem in past efforts. 
Enron is confident it has the expertise to package and make standard its 
forward contracts for DRAM in a way that renders the technical differences 
surmountable. Company officials point to Enron's pioneering effort in 
Internet bandwidth trading as an example of a market that also faced 
technical hurdles. 
But Enron officials acknowledge they are still demonstrating that their 
effort is viable and valuable. 
"We want people to first get used to it," Enron's Mr. Wang said. "It's a 
process of education." He expects trading volume to increase when big 
companies use the market. 
Enron executives said that DRAM is the first of their efforts to establish 
forward markets for all types of computer components. Eventually, Enron plans 
to trade forward contracts for components such as liquid-crystal displays. 
"We'd like to hedge maybe 60% of a computer, if possible, in the long-term," 
Mr. Wang said. "That's our plan."

Calif Eyes Ending Access To Alternative Power Suppliers
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators appear ready to vote 
next week on a proposal to suspend the ability of large electricity users to 
sign contracts directly with energy suppliers. 
The move is called for in the February bill that put the state in the power 
business, but its approval by the California Public Utilities Commission 
would damp plans in the Legislature to reduce the burden on Edison 
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison by making large 
industrial customers responsible for securing their own power.
"We're still trying to figure that out," said an aide to Assembly Speaker Pro 
Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. "We don't know how to get around that right 
now." 
Keeley is expected to introduce legislation to shift the burden of rescuing 
Southern California Edison to large businesses. Under the proposal, which is 
also supported by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, customers that use 500 
kilowatt-hours of power a month or more would pay a surcharge on their bills 
to help Southern California Edison recoup its losses on wholesale power. 
The so-called direct-access component - under those large users would buy 
their power from suppliers - is the cornerstone of the Keeley plan, for which 
Enron has been lobbying hard in recent weeks, according to several aides to 
key legislators. 
The Keeley plan is an alternative to the memorandum of understanding Gov. 
Gray Davis signed with Southern California Edison two months ago. Under that 
proposal, the state would buy Southern California Edison's power lines for 
$2.76 billion and allow the utility to issue $2 billion in bonds backed by 
ratepayers to recover $3.5 billion in net uncollected power costs. 
That plan has run into snags in the Legislature, which must enact it into 
law, and the PUC, which has been slow to rule on enabling measures. 
One key Democratic Senator said the PUC's move to quash direct access is an 
attempt to ensure a deal to rescue Southern California Edison doesn't pass 
through the Legislature. 
"The PUC has demonstrated it does not want SoCal Ed to remain solvent," the 
senator said. "They have dragged their feet on several key issues they need 
to address in order to make sure legislation to save the utility is never 
heard." 
A PUC spokesman didn't return calls for comment. 
Direct-access was the key part of the state's 1996 deregulation law, giving 
retail customers the opportunity to choose from a variety of energy suppliers 
in an effort to lower their electric rates. 
Commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque said they support direct access 
and would vote against any measure to reverse it. 
"I would never vote against direct access," said Bilas, a Republican, who 
authored the agenda item. Bilas said the item was amended by another 
commissioner. 
The measure could be held, because it might disrupt negotiations between the 
Legislature and Southern California Edison, said PUC Commissioner Geoffrey 
Brown, a Democrat. 
The PUC may be looking to protect the state's interest as a power purchaser, 
some legislative aides said. 
The DWR's long-term power supply contracts cover the state's wholesale-market 
power needs in 2002 and 2003. If large industrial customers were to sign 
direct-access contracts, the DWR would lose them as customers and thus fail 
to collect enough revenue to pay off the long-term contracts. 
The agency could be stuck with a large surplus of electricity that it would 
be forced to sell it on the open market at a loss. The market price of power 
in the coming years is expected to be lower than what the state paid for 
forward power in 2001. 
Wholesale power prices plunged this week, and the DWR for the first time sold 
excess power on the open market, according to Oscar Hidalgo, DWR spokesman. 
Arnold Rosenthal, of Newport Beach-based Utility Resource Management Group, 
an organization that represents more than 700 large electricity users in the 
state, said state regulators are "looking to get us back into a mode where we 
are held captive once again." 
"The DWR is acting as this super utility," Rosenthal said. "What you're left 
with is absolutely no choice. Instead, we'll be subjected to several large 
rate increases." 
Rosenthal said some of his San Diego clients have direct access deals. A 
number of clients served by Southern California Edison want to sign 
direct-access contracts to escape recent rate increases imposed by the PUC.

Enron's Lenders Consider Closure of Indian Project (Update6)
2001-06-07 16:13 (New York)

Enron's Lenders Consider Closure of Indian Project (Update6)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Mumbai, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- Industrial Development Bank of
India, ABN Amro Holding NV and other lenders to Enron Corp.'s $3
billion Indian power project are considering a plan to shut the
plant for as long as a year until a tariff dispute is settled.
     The lenders hired Stone & Webster, a U.S. engineering
company, to determine the costs and consequences of temporarily
closing Dabhol Power Co.'s plant, said R.S. Agarwal, executive
director of Industrial Development Bank of India.
     Indian banks, which have loaned $1.4 billion to Enron's
Dabhol Power, have the most at stake in salvaging the project, the
country's biggest foreign investment. The $600 million lent by ABN
Amro, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and other banks are
covered by government guarantees, while Indian bank loans are not.
     ``We may have to go for a mothballing of the project, which
means preservation of assets and removal of workers,'' said
Agarwal, the spokesman for Enron's lenders, who will decide on a
closure after Stone & Webster submits its report within a week.
     A solution to the dispute can only be found if all parties
are willing to make ``sacrifices,'' said Rumy Kanga, senior
general manager at Tata Power Ltd., which supplies power mainly to
industrial consumers in Mumbai. ``Lenders will have to take a
cut'' on the cost of their loans to Dabhol.

                      Completing Construction

     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, is owed 3 billion rupees
($64 million) by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for power supplied in December and January.
     The board has refused to pay, saying Dabhol's price is more
than double the rate charged by other Indian generators, and has
stopped buying power from Dabhol. It also charged Dabhol an 8-
billion rupee penalty for not supplying power at full capacity on
three days between January and March.
     Enron, the largest energy trader, has no plans for
renegotiating Dabhol's power-purchase agreement with the
Maharashtra board, company spokesman John Ambler said Friday.
     Dabhol pays 16.5 percent annual interest on the $1.4 billion
worth of rupee loans. That's more than the 11.5 percent banks
charge their best customers.
     The lenders to Dabhol, who met for a third day in Singapore,
discussed consequences of a temporary closure. Loan disbursements
of $280 million to the second phase of the project, which was to
add 1,444 megawatts of capacity, were also discussed.
     ``We've told Dabhol a closure at this stage, when 95 percent
of the construction work is over, will push up the cost of power
even further,'' Agarwal said. ``We've suggested construction and
mechanical work at the project be allowed to continue.''

                      `Keeping Project Alive'

     Dabhol should carry through with its proposal to ``suspend''
the project only if a buyer for its power is not found after the
construction is finished, Agarwal said.
    ``Foreign lenders and Dabhol are not interested in keeping the
project alive because there's no assurance that there will be
another buyer (for the power) and the power purchase agreement has
been rescinded,'' Agarwal said. ``The legal position adopted by
both the parties has complicated the issue.''
     Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee yesterday said it
would be difficult to find buyers for Dabhol's power because it's
too expensive, newspapers and news agencies reported.
     ``The difficulty (about the high cost of power) facing
Maharashtra will be for other states as well. What is to be done
about such costly power?'' he was quoted as saying.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.
     Joahn Zaayman, an Enron spokesman in India, declined to
comment on the lenders meeting.

                          Enron and India

     Shares of Enron fell $1.81, or 3.5 percent, to close at
$50.52 after touching a 52-week low of $48.80. Stocks of
California power suppliers have fallen since late May on concern
that the companies won't be paid as part of Pacific Gas &
Electric's bankruptcy filing, analysts said.
     ``It looks like the sector is taking it on the chin to begin
with, and Enron looks like it's leading the charge down because of
the news in India,'' said Andre Meade, a utility analyst at
Commerzbank Securities in New York.
     Houston-based Enron has been moving away from infrastructure
projects, such as power plants and pipelines, to focus on trading
natural gas, electricity and other commodities.
     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent this year. In addition to
the India project, investors have been concerned about California
power sales and its telecommunications unit, said Neal Dingmann, a
Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst in Dallas.
     Enron is owed $400 million to $500 million by California
power purchasers, Chairman Kenneth Lay said this week. Most of
that is owed by PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in April. Enron's broadband unit, which
has a fiber-optic network and helps trade space on such networks,
had a first-quarter loss of $35 million on revenue of $83 million.
     India ``is a distant third'' in factors moving Enron shares,
Dingmann said.


California Spending Less on Power, May Renegotiate, Reports Say
2001-06-07 14:11 (New York)


     Sacramento, California, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Department of Water Resources reduced by $630 million the amount
it is spending for power under long-term contracts and may back
away from other term offers above current market rates, reports
said.
     The department said in a posting on its Web site that the
average amount it is paying for power for five-year contracts is
$84 a megawatt-hour. It previously estimated $86 a megawatt-hour,
Dow Jones Newswires reported. A megawatt-hour can light 750
California homes for an hour.
     In the past two months, the forward price of electricity has
fallen, enabling the department to sign contracts at lower rates,
Dow Jones said. The state has agreed to contracts with 20
suppliers, including Duke Energy Corp., Calpine Corp., Enron
Corp., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc.
     The department has signed 38 contracts to purchase
electricity for the next 10 years and 23 still are being
negotiated, the San Francisco Chronicle said. Ray Hart, deputy
director of the department, said the state will demand more
favorable prices or drop some of the contracts still being
negotiated, the newspaper reported.
     The state has spend more than $7 billion buying electricity
on behalf of its two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison.
The utilities have racked up more than $14 billion in debt buying
power at soaring prices that couldn't be passed to customers.
     Shares of PG&E rose $1.03 to $12.10 in midafternoon trading.
Edison shares rose $1.02 to $11.



Enron, DuPont Urge Bush to Salvage Environmental Pact (Update1)
2001-06-07 13:15 (New York)

Enron, DuPont Urge Bush to Salvage Environmental Pact (Update1)

     (Adds White House comment on global warming report in
seventh, eighth paragraphs.)

     Washington, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., DuPont Co.,
American Electric Power Co. and other U.S. companies that have
taken voluntary steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions are urging
the Bush administration to salvage at least parts of the 1997
Kyoto global warming treaty.
     These companies ``very much like the Kyoto framework and hope
that there is a way to preserve the best parts and fix the parts
that need to be fixed,'' said Eileen Claussen, executive director
of the Pew Center for Global Climate Change, whose 33 members also
include Alcoa Inc., Holnam Inc. and BP Plc.
     President George W. Bush decided in February to oppose
regulation of the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to
global warming and to abandon the Kyoto accord.
     When U.S. allies in Europe objected, the administration
created a task force to come up with a counter proposal to reduce
harmful emissions. Bush travels to Europe next week for
discussions that will include global warming.
     The task force, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, hasn't
made a recommendation yet, White House officials said, though it
is considering a voluntary system that sets incentives and targets
for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
     Pressure on the administration to act increased yesterday
when the National Academy of Scientists released a report that
said the threat of global warming is real and will have an impact
on economic growth and public health. The NAS study had been
requested by the Bush administration.

                       White House Reaction

     The president agrees that the earth's temperature is rising
and ``is committed to reducing global warming,'' White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said today, responding to questions about
the report.
      ``There is still some remaining question about what the
cause is,'' he said, ``how much of that rise is as a result of man-
made factors.''
     The corporations that want Bush to act have been lobbying the
task force, saying regulation of carbon dioxide emissions is
inevitable. They don't want to have to deal with an international
patchwork of regulations, and they want to benefit from the anti-
pollution steps they've already taken, Claussen said.
     Other businesses, such as Exxon Mobil Corp., are arguing
against reviving Kyoto. They say the treaty is flawed because it
exempts developing nations from emission limits and that it would
damage the U.S. economy.
     The U.S. was among the 167 countries that signed the treaty,
which calls for industrial countries to cut smokestack emissions
by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Clinton
administration never presented it to the U.S. Senate for
ratification because of congressional opposition, and Bush in
March declared the treaty dead.

                          Trading Credits

     For corporations favoring an international approach, part of
the appeal is economic.
     DuPont, for example, has embraced scientific evidence of
rising global temperatures caused by carbon dioxide and other
emissions. The second largest chemical maker says it has cut its
greenhouse emissions by 50 percent since 1992 through relatively
low-cost improvements in plastics manufacturing.
     The company favors several provisions of the Kyoto accord,
including a system that would allow companies that exceed their
emissions targets to sell credits to dirtier companies.
      The company also wants to include ``credit for early
action'' that would reward its environmental efforts with tax
credits or amnesty from future regulation.
     ``We view this as a global issue that requires a global
response,'' said Thomas Jacob, who oversees DuPont's climate
change program.

                          Future Markets

     Although U.S. withdrawal from mandatory controls would appear
to let U.S. polluters off the hook, it may give European companies
an advantage to ``move more quickly toward being viable in the
future marketplace'' of clean energy sources, he said.
     Other companies such as Alcoa, BP, and Ford Motor Co. say
they view the scientific evidence of climate change to be
overwhelming and are positioning themselves for eventual controls
on carbon dioxide emissions.
     BP has set a target of cutting greenhouse gases 10 percent
below 1990 levels by 2010. It has already cut them 5 percent by
cutting methane leaks from wellheads, an effort that will
``improve profitability,'' said BP's Jeff Morgheim, who is working
on the company's climate change program.
     BP, whose chief executive John Browne visited the White House
in February, has ``been careful not to say anything'' about the
Kyoto Protocol, Morgheim said.
     Jacob said DuPont is concerned that if other countries ratify
Kyoto without the U.S. its overseas operations would be placed
under different regulations.
     ``Those of us who are multinationals could be caught in the
middle,'' Jacob said. ``What we need to do is capture some of the
positive contributions that have come out of the negotiations and
build on those.''
     Some members of the Pew group have pitched their stance
directly to the Bush administration. Executives from American
Electric Power, Enron, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Detroit Edison,
all of them Pew members, have visited the White House to advocate
regulating carbon dioxide.
     ``They've been pretty active in terms of trying to get their
views known,'' said Claussen.

                         Against Mandates

     The White House also is being pressed by the other side.
Companies that are members of the United States Council for
International Business, including Exxon Mobil, say Bush would be
unwise to go back to Kyoto, and should supplant mandatory cuts in
greenhouse gases in favor of voluntary programs.
     The group, which represents 300 companies, wrote Bush May 11
calling for voluntary efforts rather than ``rigid, mandated caps,
targets, timetables and command and control regulations,''
president Thomas M.T. Niles said in the letter.
     ``I don't think the business community will ever support
internationally mandated reductions,'' said Bill Kovacs, who
handles environmental issues at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
     National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said Bush will
share his views about global warming in meetings next week with
leaders of the European Union in Gothenburg, Sweden. ``He really
wants to talk about the seriousness of the problem and how to
address it,'' she said.
     An administration official said Bush's plans will include
voluntary measures to curb global warming, including an emissions
trading system, helping power plants improve their equipment, and
protecting farms and forests that absorb greenhouse gases.
     Kevin Fay, executive director of International Climate Change
Partnership, who is advising the White House, said Bush hopes to
have a policy finished by July 15. That's when U.S. officials will
join talks in Bonn in which European countries hope to revive the
Kyoto treaty. There is also a meeting of G-8 ministers on July 20.
     U.S. businesses are ``very concerned with the potential
appearance of this community doing nothing,'' said Fay. ``There's
a lot of potential in the outline of Kyoto.''



`Obsolete' Stock-Picking Tool Gives 52% Return: John Dorfman

`Obsolete' Stock-Picking Tool Gives 52% Return: John Dorfman

     (Commentary. John Dorfman, president of Dorfman
Investments in Boston, is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.  His firm or its clients
may own or trade investments discussed in this column.)

     Boston, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- AT&T Corp. and AMR Corp.
look like great buys according to an old-fashioned stock-
picking tool, the price-to-book ratio.
     Why should anyone care about stocks picked by such an
antique method? Because it still works, that's why.
     A year ago, I recommended seven stocks selling below
book value. They were Azurix Corp., Gaylord Entertainment
Co., Loews Corp., McDermott International Inc., Raytheon
Co., Saks Inc. and Tommy Hilfiger Corp. From June 8, 2000
through Wednesday's close these seven stocks rose an average
of 52 percent. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's
500 Index fell 11 percent.
     The best performer was Hong Kong-based clothing maker
Tommy Hilfiger Inc., which surged 117 percent. I own this
stock for some clients. Despite its big rise, it's selling
for less than 11 times earnings.
     The worst performer was Saks Inc., up 8.4 percent. The
Birmingham, Alabama, retailer has shown anemic profits in
the past four quarters, though I continue to see power in
its collection of brand-name department stores, such as Saks
Fifth Avenue, Carson Pirie Scott and Boston Store.

                      Nothing's Perfect

     Returns for the other five stocks were 108 percent for
Loews, 43 percent for McDermott, 41 percent for Raytheon, 26
percent for Gaylord and 23 percent for Azurix, which was
acquired by Enron Corp. (My clients own Loews, McDermott and
Raytheon.)
     Book value is simply corporate net worth. Take a
company's assets, subtract its liabilities and you have book
value. The price-to-book ratio is the stock price divided by
the book value per share of outstanding stock.
     Critics say book value is tainted or distorted by
corporate write-offs, inflation, or unrealistic depreciation
techniques. That's true to some degree. It was never a
perfect tool and nothing ever captures a complex reality
completely. But many, from the late Benjamin Graham on, have
successfully used book value for stock picking. It's still
useful, as this year's results attest.
     Frankly, I have no expectation of beating the S&P by 66
percentage points again over the coming year. But I think
investors who buy this year's selection of low price-to-book
stocks will probably be happy they did.

                            AT&T

     In addition to AT&T and AMR, I recommend Dillard's
Inc., Blockbuster Inc., Security Capital Group Inc., and
Kmart Inc. I reiterate my recommendation of Saks. All seven
are selling for less than book value.
     AT&T remains the nation's largest telephone company,
but it is increasingly a cable company, providing cable
television and rapid Internet service. Its stock has fallen
from about $60 in early 1999 to $21.65 today, which works
out to just 0.79 times book value.
     The biggest depressant for AT&T stock is the rate war
in long-distance voice service. I predict that within two
years a major competitor will withdraw from that field,
leading to better pricing for the remaining players. I hope,
however, that the market anticipates such a development in
advance because some of my clients own AT&T call options
that expire next January.
     AMR, like many airline stocks, has fallen because of
high prices for fuel, planes and labor. Revenue so far is
fine, but investors fear that a recession will reverse the
thrust.
     Teleconferencing and Internet conferencing are also
perceived as threats to business travel. Even with all the
problems, AMR looks cheap to me at 10 times earnings and 0.8
times book value.

                         Blockbuster

     Dillard's is a department store chain based in Little
Rock, Arkansas. It owns about 340 stores, mostly in the
Southeast, Southwest and Midwest. The stock fetches only
0.55 times book value. Analysts expect earnings to total
only $1.28 this fiscal year, the lowest in a decade. But the
company has demonstrated earnings power: It earned more than
$2 a share in six of the seven years from 1993 through 1999.
At $16.88, the stock looks bargain-priced to me.
     Blockbuster, based in Dallas, Texas, is the nation's
largest video rental company. Its stock has climbed 146
percent this year, yet still sells for 0.6 times book value.
Critics dismiss the company as a dinosaur, saying that soon
everyone will have video on demand by cable or satellite. I
doubt it. More likely, I think, is a slow transition from
old technologies to new ones. Blockbuster had free cash flow
of $6.28 a share in 2000 and the stock sells for only 3.5
times that figure.
     Security Capital, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
invests in real estate, manages real-estate properties, and
sells real-estate research. It earned $2.75 a share in the
fiscal year that ended in February; analysts expect it to
earn about a dime less this fiscal year. At the current
price of $21.27, the stock sells for just 6 times earnings
and 0.7 times book.
                            Kmart

      People will laugh at me for recommending Kmart, which
has declined about 39 percent during the past ten years. In
that decade, the S&P 500 has more than quadruped. Laughter
or not, the Troy, Michigan-based retailer is selling for
0.87 times book value and 0.14 times revenue. I think a
company that could shape it up and run it better may buy it.
     As for Saks, it earned 99 cents a share in the fiscal
year that ended in March, down from $1.64 the year before.
In the current fiscal year analysts expect earnings to
decline another 7 percent.
     With brands such as Proffitt's, McRae's, Younkers,
Parisian, Herberger's, Bergner's and Off 5th, in addition to
the ones mentioned above, I think Saks has the potential for
successful restructuring and creative financial engineering.
The stock sells for only 0.72 times book.


California to Utilize Lower Electricity Prices, Paper Reports
2001-06-07 11:04 (New York)


     San Francisco, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- California state
officials are prepared to use an unexpected drop in electricity
prices to forego almost two-dozen long-term power contracts priced
at above-market rates, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
     Two weeks ago, officials were at the whim of power companies
and were desperate for available megawatts, the paper said.
     The California Department of Water Resources already signed
38 contracts to purchase electricity at fixed prices over the next
decade, the paper said.
     The state may not need all of the other 23 contracts, or
about 40 percent of the total agreements, that are in
negotiations, the paper reported.

Rick and Linda,

Scott and I met yesterday with Rich DiMichele of EBS.  Rich is a Managing 
Director who recently has assumed responsibility for content delivery 
services, including the Blockbuster deal.

Rich is very intent on getting access to the cable platform as quickly as 
possible.  (Initially this would be primarily for delivering Blockbuster to 
more homes.  Within the year, he hopes to be able to offer services in 
addition to Blockbuster).

Scott and I prepared the attached cable open access proposal, which we gave 
to Rich yesterday.  (We had hoped to circulate this to you before giving it 
to Rich, but the timing didn't work out as initially planned.  Sorry about 
that).  Could you take a look and let us know if you have additional comments 
on the approach we have suggested?  Also, we are looking for recommendations 
on top tier law firms for cable issues.  We would be available to meet with 
them next week when we are in DC.

Thanks,

Sue

Greetings everyone,

I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the 
meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group.  

Background
As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy 
Suppliers fell apart at the end of May.  Since then, I have been working with 
Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their 
services from April 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001.  We are waiting for one last 
invoice (May expenses) from SSK.  Once we receive this invoice, Brown Olson & 
Wilson will send a lump-sum payment to SSK.  I will get you the total cost of 
SSK's services for April/May but $200,000 is an approximate number.  This 
comes to about $22,000 per each of the 9 companies that participated in the 
effort.  As you will recall, we each sent $25K to the Escrow account.  

IPPNY PR Working Group
Given the high profile of energy issues in NY, and the increasing dialogue 
taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified.  
Those of us who participated in ESES, whose companies are also members of 
IPPNY, met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to 
expand their PR efforts if we joined forces.  (Thanks to all of you who were 
able to attend and participate in the meeting).  Since last week - Gavin 
Donohue, and the IPPNY Board of Directors, have given their full support to 
this expanded effort, and we are moving foward with a comprehensive 
NY-focused communications effort.  

I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK, and the following is a summary 
of how we are proceeding.  A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is 
scheduled to take place in NYC next week.  We intend to cover the following:  
We are targeting July 4th as our launch date
A press release will go out explaining IPPNY's 7-point Energy Solutions 
Program (ESP) for New York
A Q&A, Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be 
reviewed
We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and third-party 
allies
We will also go over website issues, and other elements of the comprehensive 
plan

Essentially, the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNY's 
purposes and will be implemented going foward.  Given our late start, SSK and 
IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the above-mentioned 
documents so that we can meet a July 4th launch date.  However, I don't want 
anyone to be out of the loop.  It is our intention to provide all of the 
members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching 
on July 4th.  The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as 
part of ESES.  The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson - Gavin 
Donohue.  

Budget Issues
This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to 
respond to me asap regarding the following.  As ESES, we agreed to put forth 
$50K to our PR effort - with the first $25K going into the Escrow Account 
managed by Brown Olson & Wilson.  Once SSK is paid for April/May services 
there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account.  I would like to 
proceed as follows - with your approval.

Coordinate with Brown Olson & Wilson and pay SSK for April/May services with 
Escrow Account funds
Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNY's PR Working Group Account - 
also to be coordinated with Peter Brown (if the Escrow Agreement allows), and 
with your approval.
Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional $25K 
(assuming we are all still in for the original $50K).
Remaining Escrow Account funds + $25K will go toward SSK services going 
foward.  These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received 
from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSK's work beginning on June 
1, 2001 through the extend of the contract.  
Additional costs - such as advertising - will have to be considered after we 
get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much 
we're working with and whether advertising is a possibility.  
Enron is willing to contribute additional funds (on top of the $50K) to this 
effort if necessary.  You and your respective organizations may want to 
consider this as well. 

IPPNY/SSK Contract Issues
As you may recall, a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed.  
Contract discussions took almost 3 months, and SSK continues to work with us 
in good faith (considering they still have not been paid a dime).  Gavin is 
unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to 
pay for SSK's services.  As you can see, we must expedite payment to IPPNY so 
that we can launch on July 4th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on 
contract terms within the next two weeks.  
Gavin is reviewing the ESES/SSK contract with IPPNY's lawyers 
Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account, Gavin will sign a 
contract with SSK
We will provide everyone with a copy of the contract if you choose to review 
it (although most of you should be familiar with it). 

I think this covers the progress we've made since our meeting in Albany.  
Please call me if you have any questions about the budget, contract or the 
comprehensive plan.  I'm interested in you're input so please weigh in with 
your comments.  Lastly, I want to emphasize that I need your feedback 
regarding budget issues asap.  I am in Houston all week and can be reached at 
the following numbers:

FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that 
this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the 
specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to 
get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., 
Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the 
Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate 
agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue 
requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison 
and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's 
going to get very interesting from here.

Best,
Jeff

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we 
expected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to 
satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The 
Commission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and 
its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and 
configuration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a 
lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they 
failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or 
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order 
states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional 
transmission organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission 
indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the 
order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in 
settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these 
meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope 
characteristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach 
to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The 
order states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in 
the Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be 
more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market 
development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower 
wholesale electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the 
mediation as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is 
starting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other 
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion 
managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, 
I am attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the 
order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs 
are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  
Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and 
file a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

Jim and Rick

Please read Mike Gildea's issue 2. I work with Mike closely on operating 
policy issues.  He is with Duke NA, the IPP side, formerly with EEI.  I need 
some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his 
question.

Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority?  Or does it 
allow for any organization, i.e. GISB/EISB to perform the functions.

I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow 
down market formation - but we certainly don't want to have to deal with 
every RTO as a reliability standard setting organization.

Charles,
1. I believe we need a conference call with yourself, Lydia and few others
to assess the landscape, come to a common position and goal here.  I
believe the ugly train has left the station  and we are in damage control
at the moment.    Optimally, we need the three of us on the same page when
we go to the TCCG meeting in Tampa,  from there we can try to spread our
common message.

2. On another front, - the reliability legislation.  I told our DC office
(not that they will listen) that the legisation NERC is pushing on the
Capitol Hill is now outdated and puts too much emphasis for standards in
NERC hands when the game today is inthe RTOs.  A powerful NERC may slow up
market development.   What is the view of Enron here?  I assume the same,
but curious.  Apparently, some Hill Staffers called our DC office for
opinions on the NERC reliability legislation - so something afoot.

Charles and Mike - At yesterday's Security Subcommittee meeting, a motion
passed to change SMEPA control area configuration in the IDC to reflect the
location of their share of generation in Entergy's territory that is needed
to serve their load.  The way the IDC was working was giving erroneous
information about an overload on the Weber-Richard line, which in fact was
not happening.  I tried to prevent this change for occurring stating that
policy 9 allows for the security coordinators to adjust the cut list when
known errors are occurring.

We need to have a definite action plan for how and when increased
granularity will be allowed to happen.  Lanny Nickell is suppose to make a
presentation at the next MIC meeting about this.  But we all need to be on
the same page to have an action plan in place that we can start shopping to
MIC members. I have volunteered to head a group to try to define the "end
state" of total granularity that we would ultimately want for the IDC and
the asociated costs to get there.

Another important issue that we need to address head on is the desire of
the SCs to allow for lowering of the impact thresholds for certain
flowgates that are now not getting relief at 5%.  I asked if this motion
was passed would it guarantee that less MW's will be cut in order to get
the relief needed -- the answer was no. Therefore, why should we support
any change?  This entire issue centers around a fundamental issue that has
existed from day one when flowgates were first allowed -- what are the
standards for allowing new flowgates?  To what extent should local problems
be addressed by the transmission provider with those problems, versus
putting the pain on the entire market place because the TP can't or won't
improve their transmission facility?  (In the first days of TLR, I raised
this issue over and over again when MAIN used a 500 kV line as a proxy for
the Albion Transformer -- which caused about 2,500 source-sink pairs to be
cut throughout the eastern interconnection).  This is an issue that
ultimately will be handled by the RTOs, but education is the key here as
flowgates are being defined around the country.


Another issue is OSL determination.  Ben Li has prepared Appendix 9C1A.
There was discussion at the meeting that implementing this would further
restrict transmission access.  The SCs are all over the board on this.  I
reminded them that the MIC had asked for data for each flowgate now in
existence for TLR purposes to define for us how they determine their own
limits -- I was told at this meeting  it was never done because there was
no agreement on how to measure the OSL.  So how, I asked, can a OSL be
determined via of a NERC standard?

I have real heartburn that NERC does not have any measurable standards for
allowing the items discussed above.  We have to force criteria and
measurable standards.

Let me know what you think.  Also, what we need to do to flesh out these
issues so everyone can understand them.

Charles, I agree with you buti think we need to resist increased
granularity at this time. ?It will only decrease transmission and increase
TLR,s. ?Also the increase in transmission segments will make it more
dificult to put a transaction together.

This sounds like a tagging problem and not an IDC granularity problem.
Yes - this can be fixed with a IDC granularity change but does NERC want to
change IDC granualaruty on a piecemeal basis for this and the othe 14
control areas? ?What abot when these 15 control areas change to another
control area service provider? ?What about the next 15?

I don't think that AEP's customers actually disconnected from the AEP grid
and reconnected at some other point in another control area's transmission
network. The IDC is not mapping flows for that customer any more "wrongly"
than when that customer purchased control area services from AEP.

This is why hard criteria is needed to verify whether these 15 situations
require granularity change or whether ALL existing control areas need more
granularity for that matter.

We have been informed by one of our customers who serves a load which has
been electronically removed from the AEP Control Area that ?from now on
they will use the Electronic Control Area as the LCA, instead of using the
Physical Control Area (AEP) as the LCA. In this way, the Electronic Control
Area will be properly notified of any adjustments and approvals regarding
this transaction. Unfortunately, the IDC will be mapping the flow into one
CA while it's really going to another.

Our representative to the SSC will be arguing strenuously at their next
meeting that these types of situations need to be addressed. Historically,
the creation of a new control area has been the answer. Lou has indicated
that there are 14 of these situations pending in the Eastern Interconnect.

Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions  

To the discussion I would add the following -

1. Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful.  
The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal 
and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult 
to get the "right" zones.  Moreover, in markets like ERCOT, the zonal 
structure has been co-opted by the large incumbents to frustrate the 
development of the market.

2. One solution discussed throughout the East is the "Hybrid" model - LMP in 
the real-time and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion.  If 
structured properly, this allows the power desk to have (a) a real-time 
energy market and (b) managable transmission risk.  There are disagreements 
between the policy "experts" about Flowgates (see point 5).

3. Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for 
Enron.  Key goals - 1. single control area for the RTO, 2. real time energy 
market with no penalties for unbalanced positions, 3. market hubs (similar to 
PJM West) for liquidty, and 4. manageable transmission congestion using 
market solutions.

4. I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with "one" perfect 
market structure proposal for Enron (both for technical and timing reasons - 
California is in a different place than SPP).  We are trying to coordinate 
our statements in each of the markets as much as possible.  Most importantly, 
and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately, we need to make sure that 
saying something in one market doesn't damage our other advocacy efforts.  
Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and 
place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context.   

5. We still hear some open questions about the best form of market-based 
congestion managment (option vs. obligation; use it or lose it).  Christi 
Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues.  Please contact 
her if anyone from your teams should attend.

Call with any other questions.  At some point, we need to ensure complete 
agreement of our policy(s) and our advocacy efforts on RTOs.

		 Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions

Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.  

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a "real supply curve" and a "real demand curve" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no "real" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.

------------------------------------------------

Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision 
for RTO's that was developed by the east desk.  This vision seems to differ 
somewhat from what we are advocating in the west.  In particular, it seems 
like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in 
the zonal / flow-gate camp.  I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of 
the nodal approach -- in particular, how do the nodes map to a fairly 
homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions (i.e., a 
transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it) versus 
asset-based trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade 
settles with the market.

It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant 
different models.  For example, the west has large, long-distance, high 
voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach.  The east has more 
local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily.  It also 
could be that the political reality in the east and west require different 
positions.  As things sit now, there is no way that a zonal approach could 
fly in the northwest.  In contrast, PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal.  
Finally, it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference 
of opinion on what the "ideal" market structure should be.  If that is the 
case, then perhaps we need to talk some more.

Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west, I don't 
think that we can come up with a broad, nationwide advocacy position at this 
time.  That is, I don't think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as 
"the answer" at FERC.  Instead, I think that we should focus on the 
objectives that RTO's should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the 
best market structure should be to achieve these objectives.

What do you guys think about this?

Regards,
Tim

I took a call from a reporter this morning about pricing info for May 9 (the 
reporter wants to make the point that the state overpaid for its contracts).  
I got the following info from Bob Badeer:

May 9 -- prices at SP15 (location north of LA-south, but excluding LA) for 
July forward -- flat price, 7/24
 5-year: $75/MWh
 10-year: $63

today (6/28):
 5-year: $42
 10-year: $41

Just a note to let you know that Jean and I had a nice talk yesterday.  I 
thnik now that the session is almost over, and things are calming down in 
Austin, that she is going to get with Joe and I to discuss the department

Subject: Early Warning Information: EEMF and EME in the press


Energy guru warns against dangers of 'industry squeeze'
ENERGY liberalisation in Europe is vulnerable to political interference in
the wake of the crisis on America's West Coast, according to a leading
industry player.
The warning comes from Jonathan Green, a director at Edison Mission Energy -
one of the companies caught up in the California crisis which has seen
millions of homes left without power as prices surge by up to 50%. "As a
result of California, politicians are much more sensitive now about the
possibility of things going wrong," said Green.
The London-based Edison strategist was speaking to European Voice after a
conference of major pan-European power firms at the European Energy
Millennium Forum in Brussels last week. The companies voiced their concerns
over environmental and other political factors that could squeeze the
industry, leading to the capacity problems seen across the Atlantic. "The
danger will come if there is some sort of constraint on new capacity coming
forward," Green added.
Both fuel price increases and 'stranded costs' - debt carried over from
capital investments under previous regimes - can be passed on to consumers
in the early stages of liberalisation, thereby making the process
politically unpopular.
Industry maintains that environmental pressures contributed to the
California crisis by imposing heavy costs on the building of new plants.
"Equally in Europe you can see pressures for older plants to close down
because of emissions," said Green.
Euro-MPs are currently in conciliation talks with EU governments over new
emissions limits for large power plants that could force older generators to
shut down for part of the year. Negotiations resume next week.

2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+%

Subject: Transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the ISO=20

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time=
=20
trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP")=
=20
for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for=20
replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had=20
dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's exces=
s=20
energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to=
=20
help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is=
=20
the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO=
=20
that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything=20
wrong." =20

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk=
=20
did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had=20
requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our=
=20
desk.

and Enron=01,s Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I=01,ve got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I=01,m on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid i=

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys=
=20
put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,=01(.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn=01,t on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that be=
cause=20
of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the=
=20
Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn=
=01,t=20
matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a high=
er=20
price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we=01,re not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We=01,re not.  No, we=01,re not, okay.  We already talked to =
the=20
day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we=
=20
wanted you, if it=01,s possible, to continue to set that, whether it=01,s 2=
0 MW or=20
whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um=01(..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are=20
seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn=01=
,t it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back=01(.see, the=20
day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the=20
hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny ov=
er=20
the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up=

high.  =20

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it=
=20
back=01(.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, the=
n=20
basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that=01,s ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That=01,s really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that=01,s probably Powerex, isn=01,t it?

ISO:  Allen:  There=01,s about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn=01,t, we didn=01,=
t, we=20
took them out.  Basically, we=01,re not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn=01,t submit one for 17 or =01(.

ISO:  Allen:  That=01,s fine.  They=01,ll probably go to a penny and they=
=01,ll=20
probably get excited and do a bunch, and we=01,ll hopefully cut them off if=
 you=20
can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I=01,ll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It=01,s actually in the best interest for t=

State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put=
 a=20
stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Enron:  This is Ryan.

ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.

Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.

Subject: Gov & Reg Affairs organisation and space

We propose not to proceed with the 30 min. meeting reserved in your diaries 
(11:30-12:00 Tuesday 1 May) to discuss the G&RA  organisation and desk space 
requirement.   We attach all information below ; if you're agreeable we'll go 
ahead on this basis.  If you still wish to meet, please let us know.

Paul, Paul, Peter & Doug


Govt & Reg Affairs organisation



Charts are attached.  Changes have been made as follows:

1. France and Belgium (Bruno Gaillard + 0.5 * Research Assistant) now join 
Netherlands under Peter Styles to capitalise on previous PS involvement in 
those countries.
2. Brussels-based continental gas resource Brendan Devlin (who may now not 
join) has been split in 2 : one London-based resource under Doug Wood working 
on continental gas and one Brussels-based resource under Peter Styles as 
second base on EU.
3. Andreas Wagner (Enron Wind) affiliated with Paul Hennemeyer pro tem. 
because of linkage on German environmental issues.
4. Jan Haizmann (currently EBS regulatory) may become freed up from Far 
Eastern broadband to assist on German and EU competition issues.
5. Correction of minor errors : Frankfurt manager, assistants, other 
appointments in the pipeline omitted in previous version.

Space allocation

Professional staff will integrate with commercial teams in a combination of 
permanent desks / hot desks.  The immediate requirement is for 6 desks in 
Richard's area and 5 in Eric's.  This will increase as G&R Affairs vacancies 
are filled.  We'll provide detail to relevant assistants.

To free up maximum number of desks on 1st floor, some space could be reserved 
on 5th floor next to PR for other G&RA requirements (assistants, govt affairs 
library, extensive paper files, hot desks at peak times / "quiet desks" for 
reviewing legislation, licences etc).  This can be reduced over time to the 
extent library can be digitized and assistants found space among commercial 
groups.  Alternatively, if space pressures on 1st floor are increasing, G&RA 
staff can regroup on 5th floor and free up desks on 1st for commercial staff, 
as before.  Precise requirements will be worked out with Toby Knight.

I have attached a proposal prepared by Reliant.  Reliant hopes that it is 
something that Enron can support (with any modifications).  Steve Walton has 
concerns about the role of the WSCC.  ELCON supports the concept with some 
other modifications.  I recognise that there are issues. Nonetheless, to 
respond to Barton's short term emergency measures, it would be usefule to 
know whther a negawatt program across the WSCC can be im[plemented by June.

Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds

N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

JULY 19, 2001



U.S. Energy Regulators Restructure The
Transmission Grid, Call for Four
Regional Transmission Organizations

Jonathan W. Gottlieb, Esq.
Roger M. Gibian, Esq.

On July 12th, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a series
of orders that fundamentally restructures the transmission system in the
United States. In its orders FERC called for the development of one Regional
Transmission Organization for each of the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and
Western regions of the country.  An immediate result of these actions is
that FERC directed:  (1) the New York ISO, NEPOOL, PJM, and PJM-West into
mediation proceedings for the formation of a single RTO covering the
Northeast United States from Maryland and West Virginia north to Maine; and
(2) the Southern Companies, Southwest Power Pool, Entergy, and GridSouth
into mediation proceedings for the formation of a single RTO in the
Southeast.  The Commission allowed Southwest Power Pool the option of
instead pursuing involvement in an RTO in the Midwest, and encouraged, but
did not require, the entities comprising the GridFlorida RTO to engage in
the Southeast RTO mediation proceedings.

These orders reflect the ascendancy of a coalition of Commissioners Massey,
Wood, and Brownell, and represent a fundamental shift in FERC's RTO
formation policy.  FERC has sent a clear signal that it is shifting away
from its pattern of supporting maintenance of the status quo and towards a
more actively engaged posture to shape the Nation's energy policy.  These
orders reflect the apparent frustration being felt by many at FERC and the
fact that the agency has clearly run out of patience with the slow pace of
the voluntary RTO formation process.  In a surprising twist, in its orders
the Commission openly expresses its disappointment with the lack of progress
being made in various existing RTO proceedings.  Given the dismissive tone
and far-reaching scope of these orders, it seems safe to assume that FERC
will not hesitate to terminate collaborative processes it perceives to be
unproductive, and will take the extraordinary step of directing parties into
time-limited settlement discussions with the threat of Commission action if
the parties do not work their problems out on their own.  By forcefully
asserting its control over the process and altering the configuration of
RTOs at this late stage in their development, the Commission is showing that
it will aggressively pursue its goal of having large-scale region-wide RTOs
operational by its December 15, 2001 target date.

With the recent addition over the past several months of new Commissioners
Wood and Brownell,  FERC now possesses a reinvigorated political will to
take more aggressive action to ensure the implementation of its regulatory
policy agenda.  Commissioner Wood, a close friend of President Bush and
widely expected to replace Chairman Hebert following the August recess, has
been pursuing an active agenda since arriving at the Commission earlier this
year.  Although recently rebuffed in his efforts to establish numerous new
rulemaking dockets (due to lack of available staff support), Commissioner
Wood's separate concurring statements that renewable resources are an
increasingly important part of the nation's energy mix, that congestion
management must be addressed in a standard format nationally, and that the
$5,000 annual membership fee for voting members of PJM prevents reasonable
inclusion of individual residential and small customers, indicate that a
Commission led by a Chairman Wood would be receptive to creative and
innovative proposals as well as aggressive in its pursuit of the
organizational structure it believes best for competitive markets.

In its orders on July 12th, the Commission indicated its receptiveness
towards adopting standardized generation interconnection agreements and
standardized procedures for the conversion of interconnection agreements,
while Commissioner Wood expressed additional support for the adoption of a
national standardized congestion management scheme and the development of
uniform reliability and market interface practices.  Adopting standardized
procedures in these areas will produce two significant benefits:  (1) it
will promote generation investment and market stability; and (2) it would
promote the efficient use of FERC staff resources, as staff would no longer
be required to process the significant number of filings and pleadings it
presently receives in connection with these issues.  This latter point is
especially important, given that Commissioner Wood has been frustrated in
his attempts to initiate new rulemaking procedures and promote a more active
agenda due to a lack of available staff resources.  Given Commissioner
Massey's explicit mention of the "crushing workload" that staff has been
under and Commissioner Wood's incentive for freeing up staff resources, FERC
should be taking significant steps in the future towards the standardization
of a wide variety of procedures.

Establishing four region-wide RTOs will increase the availability of power
supplies, reduce problems in sending electricity between control areas, and
create a more liquid national electricity market.  Placing large portions of
the Nation's transmission grid under the control of a single operator will
help eliminate transmission constraints, increase reliability, and lower
wholesale prices.  Given the Commission's disposition towards establishing
these large-scale RTOs, it appears inevitable that the Commission will
direct parties in the Midwest and Western regions into mediation proceedings
similar to those convened for the Northeast and Southeast.  Orders
initiating those proceedings will probably be issued after the Southeast and
Northeast proceedings have concluded.

At about the same time the National Association of Gas Consumers filed their 
complaint calling for a nationwide benchmark price for natural gas sales, the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power filed a petition for reimposition 
of the price cap on short-term capacity release and pipeline capacity 
transactions.  LADWP's petition was basically the same as the request for 
emergency relief filed by San Diego Gas & Electric in December, which FERC is 
still considering.  We have answered LADWP's petition incorporating our 
comments in San Diego and have asked that the two proceedings be consolidated 
since the issues are the same and parties have already expended a lot of time 
and effort in providing data to FERC in San Diego.

We did not receive FERC's notice on the LADWP petition that was issued Monday 
until yesterday, and responses are due today, so we did not have enough time 
to circulate our attached filing for review and comments.

This morning, all 5 FERC commissioners testified before the Senate Energy 
Committee on yesterday's order and on the pending Feinstein/Smith legislation 
to impose cost-of-service rates on wholesale power.  Highlights and analysis 
are as follows:

1. Sen. Feinstein, the chief sponsor of Senate price cap legislation, called 
FERC's order "a giant step forward" and said she is "very grateful" for what 
the commission did.  Senators Gordon Smith and Barbara Boxer agreed.  Sen. 
Feinstein said that she and Sen. Smith would now recommend to Chairman 
Bingaman that next week's mark up of their price control bill be postponed 
"for the time being" pending how the order plays out in practice.  Chairman 
Bingaman said he would follow their advice and cancel next week's mark up.  
(Responding to a question, each of the five commissioners said that Congress 
should NOT act to pass Smith/Feinstein, at least at this time -- this 
included Comr. Massey, who has favored legislation in the absence of 
"stronger" action by the commission.)

2. However, it is very important to point out that House Democrats in 
California and elsewhere out West have not been as supportive of FERC's order 
as have the Senators.  House Democrats are still expected to attempt to offer 
a price control amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill when it 
comes before the House later this week.  Of course, the reaction of the 
Senate may undercut the House Democrats's argument, at least at this time.  
Furthermore, should prices go up and the FERC order is seen as not working, 
price control advocates, including Sens. Feinstein, Smith and Boxer, will no 
doubt pick up where they left off.

3. It will be very interesting to see how Senator Lieberman and Gov. Davis 
react to the FERC order at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing 
tomorrow morning.  While this committee does NOT have legislative 
jurisdiction over the Feinstein/Smith legislation, this hearing will be well 
covered by the news media.  Sen. Lieberman is a cosponsor of the 
Feinstein/Smith legislation.

4. In my view, the political and public pressure will now shift in large part 
-- at least for the time being -- from the legislative price cap proposals to 
the settlement conference process that the FERC order will set motion.  There 
was a clear drum beat at the hearing from the western senators, particularly 
Feinstein, Boxer and Cantwell (WA), for refunds either out of the settlement 
conference or ordered by FERC.  In essence, they are pressing to have the 
price mitigation formula in the new order applied to power sales that took 
place prior to the issuance of the order.

5. Another sense of the poltiical flavor is that Sen. Schumer (D-NY), while 
expressing his continued support for deregulatioin and competition, pressed 
FERC general counsel Kevin Madden (by this point the commissioners left for 
the RTO conference) about why the order applied only to the WSCC and did not 
apply nationwide.  Madden at least tried to distinguish the New York and 
California markets, but then said that Con Ed has filed pleadings with FERC 
to extend price mitigation to New York and he could not say any more about 
the matter.

6. Ranking Republican Frank Murkowski said he had received a letter today 
from four western governors -- those from Arizona, North Dakota, Utah and 
Wyoming -- saying that since FERC has acted, there is no need for Congress to 
pursue price control legislation.

There were a series of questions and comments on details and technical 
aspects of the orders.  I will do an e-mail on these items later today.   
Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

Private message.
Cynthia has dramatically increased her attacks on me in recent days--I've had 
"warnings" from a number of people.
She's openly saying that I have no Hill experience, she has attacked my use 
of outside consultants, she has challenged my handling of the BLM/Forest 
Service issue.
Today I heard about a message she sent to someone outside the company, 
"suggesting" to them that they never meet with me alone, but always have 
Chris Long present, and further that any communications with me in the future 
copy Scott and Donald.  In short, she's now trying to undercut my authority 
not just inside the office, but outside the office as well.
I've requested a meeting Thursday morning with Joe and Cynthia.  My strategy 
will be to say to Cynthia "if there's anything you want to say to me, now is 
the time," and to turn to Joe and say "You supervise both of us and I 
appreciate your being here to help us sort this out."

 I spoke with Bill Hawkins (Premier's Office)  to day and made the following 
points: a) the messages from the Premier/Wilson are still ambiguous and 
unclear; b) we will need clarification on three questions: 1) Is May 2002 a 
deadline (as per Wilson) or a target (as per Harris)?; 2) Is the gov't still 
prepared to consider a Fall opening if the 4 conditions are met?; and 3) Is 
the return of  the first Pickering A unit a pre-condition to market opening? 
- if it is, then any question about a Fall opening is moot since the earliest 
that unit will come back is December 31, 2001 (and more likely 
later).                          I did not press Bill for answers today but 
indicated that we would need clarification on these issues as soon as 
possible to stay engaged in the way that he wants us to. I outlined the 
interpretation that we had been encouraged  by Ministry of Energy to put on 
the message.  Importantly, Bill did not "shut down" our preferred 
interpretation.                                     Bill made three points: 
a) the critical factor in the announcement was continuing concern about the 
circumstances in California and the difficulties that California presents for 
making the decision to press ahead this year;   b) on the political front, 
the key opposition to moving ahead will come from the NDP rather than the 
Liberals: he wants us to help keep the Liberals on the sidelines;  and c) the 
gov't  (Ministry of Energy) is going to work on fleshing out over the next 
several weeks how they will assess when the 4 conditions will be satisfied 
and he wanted our help in that 
process.                                             I told Bill that we 
wanted to stay engaged but that our immediate interest was getting 
appropriate clarification of the message.                        Following 
Bill's call, I heard from Joel Singer, VP at OPG, who indicated that Floyd 
Laughren had assured OPG yesterday that the OEB was still targeting a Fall 
opening in its retail readiness efforts.  Singer did indicate, however, that 
OPG's  own demand supply assessment was not  as positive as our own and that 
concerns about the demand/suppy balance was continuing to be a big hurdle to 
get over.                            The IMO is also sticking with its 
testing/commissioning timeline and is not altering it in light of the 
announcement on Monday.                          `

I've arranged 2 meeting in Paris on with EFET- France re gas issues. The 
agenda will include our take on what is going on in the US and French Gas 
issues. I have a feeling unfortunately that this meeting will not be well 
attended as we set it up farley late. Caroline Lambinon from Dalkia (French 
ESP with EDF, Vivendli ownership) is the only person that has responded. 

The second meeting is with the French regulator. Again the opportunity to 
meet with them is based on the Cal experience. Michel Massoni will be present 
with others yet to be determined.   Massoni is the director for the 
department in charge of  relations with Third Parties. I will forward you 
more information on the French market. I will also be present at the meeting 
on Tuesday at the EU.

President Bush Reverses Position on CO2 Emissions

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News Item from The Washington Post, March 14] President Bush has decided n=
ot=20
to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the nation's=20
power plants, reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering=20
strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli=
es=20
on Capitol Hill. In a letter to four Republican senators, Bush cited a rece=
nt=20
Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO2 emissions would=20
result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs.=
=20
"I do not believe=01(that the government should impose on power plants mand=
atory=20
emissions for carbon dioxide," Bush said.=20

Analysis: The sudden change in President Bush's position on CO2 emissions=
=20
naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate. The=
=20
extent to which CO2 contributes to the nation's pollution, and whether or n=
ot=20
the government should take an active role in restricting CO2 emissions, has=
=20
become an intensely politicized issue. Democrats and environmental groups=
=20
responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president=
,=20
while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bush's decision will=20
ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy.=20

I won't attempt to debate the political aspects of the president's decision=
.=20
Rather, I will analyze Bush's current position impacts the energy industry,=
=20
and whether or not the lifting of CO2restrictions does indeed contribute to=
 a=20
sound energy policy. =20

It is true that during his campaign, the president made promises to limit C=
O2=20
emissions. In a speech in late September, Bush said, "With the help of=20
Congress, environmental groups and industry, we will require all power plan=
ts=20
to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide,=
=20
nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of=20
time." Yet, while many critics have claimed that Bush's refusal to place=20
limits on CO2 is a philosophical turnabout, White House spokesman Scott=20
McClellan said that carbon dioxide "should not have been included as a=20
pollutant" in Bush's campaign position because it is not classified as one =
in=20
the Clean Air Act. Further, the White House has said that Bush's original=
=20
promise was a "mistake" inconsistent with the president's broader goal of=
=20
increasing domestic energy production.=20

In fact, although many scientists believe that CO2 is a key contributor to=
=20
global warming, it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human=
=20
health. Consequently, CO2 has never been classified as a pollutant under th=
e=20
Clean Air Act because, in the eyes of those determining Clean Air=20
classifications, it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact=
,=20
except as it applies to concerns about global warming. In his decision to=
=20
abstain from placing any restrictions on CO2 emissions, Bush noted "the=20
incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to=
,=20
global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f=
or=20
removing and storing carbon dioxide." The president maintains that he is=20
committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality=20
emissions of NOx, SO2 and mercury, which are already regulated as pollutant=
s,=20
but not CO2. Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce=20
emissions from power plants specifically, but that any such strategy would=
=20
include phased-in reductions and market-based incentives to help the indust=
ry=20
meet the targets. =20

Moreover, the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio=
ns=20
on CO2 emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on=20
domestic power supply. Clearly, any limits on CO2 emissions would have=20
tremendous impact on coal-burning power plants. By some estimates, coal, a=
=20
relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than 50 percent=
=20
of the electricity generated in the United States, produces about 40 percen=
t=20
of the nation's CO2 output (more than any other fuel). Yet, industry=20
officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO2 emissio=
ns=20
would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production. Since Bush=
=20
took office as president in January, it has become increasingly clear that =
a=20
major component of the president's imminent energy plan will be efforts to=
=20
increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa=
l,=20
natural gas and nuclear. The president has maintained that he sees a=20
supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar. However,=
=20
according to reports out earlier this week, Bush is proposing to cut the=20
DOE's renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by 30 to 40 percent. In=
=20
any case, establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time, and the=20
president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis=20
resulting from a growing supply / demand imbalance. =20

Aside from power supply concerns, the president also acknowledged the curre=
nt=20
high prices for natural gas, and how a reduction in coal-fired generation=
=20
would most likely keep prices at their high levels. In fact, the president=
=20
said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba=
ck=20
away from CO2 restrictions, more than any pressure he might have received=
=20
from oil and coal lobbying groups, as has been reported in many recent news=
=20
articles. Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO2=
=20
emissions would have led to "significantly higher electricity prices." The=
=20
translation of this is that, if restrictions were to be placed on=20
coal-burning plants, many power suppliers would turn to natural-gas=20
production as an alternative. Natural-gas supplies are already compromised =
in=20
this country due to increasing demand, which has driven prices up to=20
unprecedented levels. Bush's decision reflects the concern that, if power=
=20
suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers, this wi=
ll=20
continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high.=
=20
"This is important new information that warrants a re-evaluation, especiall=
y=20
at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage," President=
=20
Bush said. =20

The DOE report also indicated that because coal-fired power plants are the=
=20
major power sector emitters of CO2, compliance with the emission caps would=
=20
be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production, both=
=20
nationally and regionally. If CO2caps were to be put into place, substantia=
l=20
reductions in coal consumption would result, according to the DOE, with=20
corresponding drops in the projections for coal production. Further, becaus=
e=20
coal has a carbon content more than 70 percent higher per Btu than that of=
=20
natural gas, the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to=
=20
CO2 caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants=20
uneconomical.=20

In addition to the DOE report, Bush continues to be counseled by an energy=
=20
advisory team, including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer=
=20
Abraham, as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party=
.=20
Many Republican senators, including Jesse Helms (North Carolina) and Chuck=
=20
Hagel (Nebraska) expressed alarm over Bush's campaign promises to reduce CO=
2=20
emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying =
an=20
international treaty regarding pollution control. The Kyoto Protocol,=20
negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified,=
=20
would commit 38 industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO2 (along with=
=20
SO2 and NOx) emissions. Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last=20
November, but are expected to resume this July. If ratified, the Protocol=
=20
would limit CO2 emissions below 1990 levels. Currently, CO2 emissions in th=
e=20
United States are about 12 percent over 1990 levels. Reportedly, Sens. Helm=
s=20
and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it=
=20
could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be=
=20
directed by an international treaty. =20

It is important to note how the president's new stand on CO2 emissions=20
relates to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Just two weeks ago, t=
he=20
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards=
=20
designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air. However, the EPA=
=20
does not currently regulate CO2 emissions. EPA Administrator Christine=20
Whitman, in a series of public statements, had vehemently defended and=20
supported President Bush's previously espoused commitment to controlling CO=
2=20
emissions. =20

Meanwhile, the president's change in policy precedes several bi-partisan=20
bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week.=
=20
The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to=20
modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx. Given the=
=20
president's new stance, however, the prospects for these bills gaining much=
=20
momentum may diminish.=20

In summary, President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to=20
short-term resolutions to the nation's energy crisis over long-term=20
environmental concerns. Given the fact that coal presently generates more=
=20
than half of the nation's energy needs, the fossil fuel=01*despite its deba=
ted=20
environmental impacts=01*is a critical component of the U.S. energy supply.=
=20
Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the country's power=
=20
supply, it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy=
=20
reliance on coal to continue, at least for the near term. While some will=
=20
continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise=
s=20
and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists, an argument can be made=
=20
that the nation's supply problems have worsened since last fall when the=20

including consistently high natural-gas prices, demand that remains on the=
=20
rise and a continued reliance on coal, which remains comparatively=20
inexpensive=01*it is understandable that the president would take this posi=
tion.=20
However, the general consensus among scientists is that CO2 emissions=20
contribute to global warming, and that a long-term solution to curb CO2=20
emissions must be enacted.  As President Bush unveils his energy plan over=
=20
the next few weeks, it will be interesting to see how or if he addresses th=
e=20
issue of CO2 emissions from a long-term perspective. =20

Harris accused of cursing Liberal critic
RICHARD MACKIE

Wednesday, June 6, 2001 
Premier Mike Harris, showing his apparent frustration over persistent 
questioning about his role in the 1995 Ipperwash affair, called Liberal MPP 
Gerry Phillips an "asshole" yesterday in the legislature.
The Premier's office later denied he had used the word.
But several Liberal and New Democrat MPP said they had heard him clearly, 
despite the clamour from both sides of the legislature that erupted with Mr. 
Phillips's attacks on the Premier.
NDP deputy leader Frances Lankin described the incident. "I am going to quote 
the Premier. As he sat down he muttered 'And you are an asshole,' speaking of 
Gerry Phillips."
She was one of several MPPs who immediately demanded that the Premier 
withdraw the remark, as parliamentary procedure requires of any impolite 
comment uttered on the floor of the legislature.
Rick Bartolucci, Liberal MPP from Sudbury, had a similar recollection. "He 
clearly said, looking down but towards Gerry, 'You're an asshole.' "
The remark was not picked up by the microphones, as the one on Mr. Harris's 
desk apparently was turned off. Attorney-General David Young was speaking at 
the time, responding to Mr. Phillips's question.
Nor was the remark recorded by the legislature's Hansard.
Speaker Gary Carr said he did not hear it and noted that there had been a 
general tumult in the legislature at the time that made it difficult to hear 
any specific comments.
Mr. Phillips's questions about Mr. Harris's role in ordering an end to a 
native protest at Ipperwash Provincial Park, which resulted in the shooting 
of Dudley George six years ago, generally result in outcries from MPPs on 
both sides of the legislature.
A statement from the Premier's Office disputed the opposition MPPs' 
assertions that Mr. Harris had used profanity in referring to Mr. Phillips.
"The Premier has the utmost respect for the legislature and his fellow MPPs 
on both sides of the House," it said. "The allegation is false."
Government House Leader Janet Ecker defended the Premier.
"I didn't hear the remark. What I do know is many times members on all sides 
of the House get a little heated up in debate. And everyone has said 
something in that legislature that, on reflection, they perhaps wished they 
hadn't said."
Last month, she was displeased when Liberal House Leader Dwight Duncan 
accused her of throwing "a hissy fit" in the legislature.
Opposition MPPs said the fact the Premier would use such language shows he 
senses the damage a public inquiry about the shooting of the unarmed native 
protester could do to his reputation.
Mr. Phillips, who said he heard the remark but refused to repeat it, 
commented: "It's tragic. This situation involves a very serious matter. And 
the Premier has chosen to try the personal attacks instead of trying to deal 
with the issue."
The veteran Liberal MPP added: "I've come to expect it from him now. . . . 
It's completely in character for him. Maybe he thinks he can bully people and 
get away with it. But I won't be bullied and most people won't be bullied."
Mr. Phillips had been asking the Premier why he is attempting to bankrupt Mr. 
George's family by forcing them to proceed with a civil suit to uncover Mr. 
Harris's role in the shooting.

A phone call was held today.  Some issues / actions from the call ---

1. Right now it appears that this would be announced around June 5 at the 
Mayor's regular press meeting.  Checking this out.  Need to make sure that PR 
will be able to cover the meeting and answer any background the press may 
have on us.

2. Deal team wants Enron PR to meet with DEP PR next week (May 30?) to begin 
working up the Mayor's statement on the benefits of this transaction.  Should 
we have a Govt Affairs person at the meeting to pick up the "politics" of the 
message?  Just a thought.

3. No one really wants to hire any outside PR support.  Everyone was 
comfortable with Peggy and her team taking the lead.  Don't want to appear 
that Enron is "selling" the deal.  The deal is good and we should let it 
speak for itself.  Does everyone agree?

4. We are looking for a consultant  to support us on MWBE issues.  This 
should be done (at least contracted) by June 1.

5. What have we told outside political support about this deal (eg, Piper, 
Marbury)?  Sue Landwehr and Roy we need to make sure that you have some time 
the week of June 5 to cover any political issues that may arise.  Can we 
coordinate our schedules?

Thanks,

Jim

Janine -- 

Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the 
Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt.  
Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed 
with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than 
Friday, August 17th.  I will be preparing a report for your use noting the 
final ratings of your Exempt employees from the PRC meetings and distribute 
that within the next week.

For your Non-Exempt employees, I have listed below all eligible employees for 
whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation.  However, I need the 
rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP system.  The 
descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as:

1 - Consistently performs above expectations
2 - Meets expectations
3 - Does not meet expectations

Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees below and 
return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.

Mike:

I regret that we had a difficult call yesterday.   We greatly appreciate the 
good work that you do and the commitment you and your firm have to our 
company.  Moreover, I recognize that the legislature is a difficult 
environment and that there is substantial pressure on you and Sandy.  I also 
recognize that needs and demands can change quickly and, at times, our RCR 
process can be difficult!

All that said, however, the Government Affairs group has an obligation to use 
our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process helps us satisfy that obligation..  

>From our conversation yesterday and a later call with Sandy, it appears that 
there is some confusion on how we will use the RCR process to contract for 
legal support for our legislative efforts.  Hopefully this e-mail will 
clarify the process so there is no confusion in the future and so that you 
can feel comfortable you are undertaking work that is authorized and for 
which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears from your e-mail yesterday that Goodin, MacBride has 
billings as of May 11 for approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall 
profits, the "Global Settlement," and Power Plant Siting.  With respect to 
this work, I recognize that there may have been confusion about our budgeting 
and RCR approval process.  These billings will be included in the 
RCR-approval requests discussed below.  

2As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May was 
conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know we 
terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs were 
filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis.  The 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, the proposed budget was not RCR approval.  

In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arises--i.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, we can get emergency 
approval for work necessary to respond to the emergency.   Please contact me 
in the event of an emergency.  I can be reached through my office 
line--503.464.7945, pager--888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  If I 
can't be reached, please contact Jim Steffes.  Jim's pager number is 
888.906.9676.  Note that both Jim and I wear the pager at all times and 
respond immediately to messages left on the pager.  

3.  Pending RCR approval for the matters identified below, I have asked 
Goodin MacBride to participate in the Direct Access coalition meetings taking 
place today and tomorrow.  In a discussion with Sandy yesterday, I agreed 
that Goodin MacBride should participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  

4.  To the maximum extent possible, you should include Leslie Lawner in 
future Direct Access Coalition meetings, conference calls, legislative 
drafting efforts, etc.  

5.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, please contact me before undertaking an assignment.  If I 
am unavailable, please contact Jim Steffes.   

6.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

7.  Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride that involve the Global Settlement; it simply 
means that before that work begins Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and "Plan B," to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  
Again, we appreciate your hard work and commitment to our efforts.  

Paul Kaufman

I thought that you would be interested in the feedback from the Board of 
Trade Electricity Taskforce meeting this morning:                          a) 
On the weekend, May 4- 6, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopted 
the Toronto Board of Trade's  position paper re market opening on November 1, 
2001.   The OCC is the umbrella organization of all local chambers of 
commerce/ boards of trade across Ontario.  The Toronto Board of Trade 
position paper largely follows the Enron position paper re market 
opening.                              b) Elyse Allan, Louise Verity and Jan 
Carr (all representing the Toronto Board of Trade) met with Minister Wilson 
and Judy Hubert on Tuesday, May 8. Wilson explicitly asked the BOT to "keep 
up the heat" on a November 1 opening. Wilson was evidently very impressed by 
the OCC resolution.                       c) Some concern was expressed  by 
David McFadden (head of SAC and BE's lawyer)   that  OPG may not put the 
fossil units on the block until August, since the Ministry of the 
Environment's new emissions regulations will not be promulgated until that 
time.  Paul might want to raise this with Gord Homer: I don't see why OPG 
would have to wait until August  to begin the process; the substance of the 
regs are known now, even if they are not law until 
August.                       d) A fight is brewing between the City of 
Toronto and the Province regarding the Hearn facility.  The City wants to 
tear it down  as part of their waterfront plan but the Province is pushing to 
keep it as a generation facility of some type. The IMO has evidently prepared 
a report on the issue that has not yet been made 
public.                                        e)There was a push from some 
taskforce members (particularly Jan Carr) to adopt, as a transitional 
measure, some type of controls to limit exports and control prices in 
Ontario.  This was a non-starter with most of the members of the taskforce 
and that initiative will not go forward. I have undertaken, instead,  to give 
the BOT some talking points that they can use in answering questions about  
interregional trade and the type of comments that Howard Hampton  (NDP 
leader) is making about the US sucking cheap power out of Ontario.

I talked to Bill Butler after this came out. Bill and Judge Miller supposedly 
advised the Governor that this moratorium was not a good idea. I suggested to 
Bill that LG&E was behind this, but he told me that the Gov is also planning 
a Senate run, and that this move is related. I also mentioned this to Johnny 
Hayes. Between Bill and Johnny, I should be able to get more info. Bill also 
told me he was named to the State energy committee.

We are working on Calvert, but as we have already applied for an air permit, 
we are only potentially affected to the extent we modify the equipment in our 
application. As such, I would like to see the text of the Governor's order to 
determine if equipment changes for applications already submitted would be 
precluded. Dave Kellermeyer / Scott Churbock are also looking into this.

As you know, we face a similar moratorium in Georgia. I have asked Johnny 
Hayes to find out if there is any movement in TN with respect to a moratorium.

I think for right now, my group's main need is to (i) understand the KY 
moratorium and whether it precludes us from changing equipment in our air 
permit application; (ii) whether a moratorium could spread to TN (we have a 
couple more sites we're working on there); and (iii) if we can leverage any 
political connections in GA to help us navigate the particulars of that 
state's moratorium.  

Barbara, toward that end, it would be helpful if you would contact Raimund 
Grube (x 3-0433) on Georgia, and Chris Booth (x 5-3364) on Tennessee. I'd 
like you to work with them and Churbock / Kellermeyer on answering these 
three questions.

Thanks much.

Ben

Subject: KY: 180 day moratorium on power plant applicationsq

Effective June 20th, Governor Patton issued an Executive Order directing 
state agencies to temporarily suspend the acceptance of applications for new 
electric generating facilities.  The Governor also ordered the PSC and NREPC 
(Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet)  to study a variety 
of environmental and energy issues and report their findings to him by 
December 7th.  

The Governor stated 3 concerns in his press release: reliable cheap energy, 
the potential effects of additional air emissions and the effect of new 
plants on the supply grid. His quote suggests that he is naturally looking 
out for local interests: "We must strive to strike a balance between our 
energy needs, our ability to generate energy for others and our commitment 
for a clean, safe environment."  And then he also directs the agencies to pay 
particular attention to the utilization of KY coal.

Ben, As I understand it, you still are working on Calvert City.  Please 
advise as to whether or not you want us to monitor the agencies' as they 
study the issue -- and to what extent.

In other news, the Governor has also created the Kentucky State Energy Policy 
Advisory Board to develop a state energy policy.  He has just named committee 
members but they have not begun work yet.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: April 10, 2001

RE: Draft EPSA Brief to the Supreme Court in the Appeal of
      Order No. 888
      ? Comments due by Friday, April 13th

Attached is a draft of the brief EPSA's counsel has drafted for filing in 
support of Enron's position in the U.S. Supreme Court appeal of Order No. 
888.  EPSA's brief focuses on how FERC's failure to assert jurisdiction over 
interstate transmission bundled with retail power sales creates a regulatory 
gap that allows vertically integrated utilities substantial competitive 
advantages and creates incentives for discrimination.

Please review the draft brief and provide written comments to Julie Simon at 
202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org by close of business on Friday, April 13th.  
The brief must be filed with the Court on Thursday, April 19th, but we need 
to allow adequate time from printing to the Court's specifications.   If you 
have any questions or concerns, please contact Julie.

		 Subject: EOL Regulation - CFTC or FERC?

As you are all probably aware, FERC staff will be conducting a visit to Enron 
next Monday to discuss EOL and electronic trading's role in the energy 
markets.   Dave Forester, Kevin Presto, and Phillip Allen will be giving 
presentations about the EOL platform, power trading, and gas trading, 
respectively.

In preparing for the meetings, the issue of which agency, CFTC or FERC, 
regulates the EOL platform and any energy related financial products sold by 
Enron (everyone agreed that physical deals through EOL were FERC 
jurisdictional) came up.

It is unclear about Enron's current position.  While there is a strong case 
that both the EOL platform and any energy related financial products are 
regulated by the CFTC, some people believed that Enron had previously 
informed FERC that they were the "appropriate" agency for the energy related 
financial products.

We do not intend to make an issue of this topic with the FERC staff on 
Monday, but rather wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page 
going forward.

Please let me know if we need to have a meeting to bring this to closure.

Jim

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 
days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order 
establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power 
delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction 
of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by 
suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to 
the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be 
exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the 
duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus 
if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective 
date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct 
such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue 
requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the 
revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond 
revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR 
bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If 
we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be 
necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR 
costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, 
would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the 
clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the 
bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the 
bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such 
that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the 
amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take 
precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund 
and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 
2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

		 Subject: Minnesota/Price RIsk Management

All--earlier this week the Minnesota PUC and the Department of Commerce 
jointly hosted a workshop on on "LDC RIsk Management".  There was a 
presentation by Ken Costello from NRRI based on a paper that he has written; 
a panel consisting of reps from Reliant Minnegasco, Xcel, UtiliCorp, Alliant 
and MDU Resources (Great Plains); and a presentation from Blake Herndon of 
Williams Energy.  The discussion focused exclusively on natural gas--nothing 
on power. Two of the five Commissioners sat in on parts of the presentation 
along with a number of staffers.

There was (as always seems to be the case) no clear indication from the 
workshop what actions would take place as a result of the discussion.  My 
sense would be that there may be an investigatory or study docket opened, but 
not a formal proceeding that would lead to any meaningful policy 
implementation requiring risk management to be utilitzed. I think that the 
PUC is open to approving modest plans that the LDC might bring before them, 
but they are not willing to be proactive.

Although it was not stated publically, in my private conversations with the 
utilities I got a strong sense that Xcel would be coming with some type of 
proposal--possibly a request for pass thru on limited premium costs.  Alliant 
and MDU will not, and I think Utilicorp will do something along the lines of 
filing for a fixed price option that will be offered to their residential 
customers. As  I had indicated in a previous e mail, Reliant has already 
gotten approval for pass thru of call option premiums and I think that they 
are also petitioning for a fixed price option for residential customers.

Call if you have any questions--#612-339-4599-- or would like copies of any 
materials.

Subject: Re: Draft Questions for Hoecker =20

Tom--[[For your background information for Senator Gordon--you will need to=
=20
edit out the information on the part Enron played, but I thought you would=
=20
want the entire picture]].

 Until the Tennessee Power case issued in March, most utilities considered=
=20
interconnection issues and procedures to be within their discretion.  The=
=20
only FERC approved policies were in PJM and NEPOOL.  These policies are=20
fairly idiosyncratic to those pools.  Since Enron began siting merchant=20
generation with our 1999 peaking plants in TVA, we had told FERC that there=
=20
were problems in getting utilities to be responsive.  The main problem was=
=20
failure to provide study results in a timely manner.

 I think it is important to note that merchant facilities are a fairly new=
=20
idea.  They are not rate-based, and have no guaranteed return paid for=20
directly by retail customers (except perhaps to the extent that a utility=
=20
signs a deal to purchase capacity and/or energy from the merchant.)  Plus, =
I=20
think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate=
d=20
structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants (les=
s=20
supply).

? TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY -- FERC issued an order o=
n=20
3/15/00 clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues.  The order=
=20
is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying=20
efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enron's membership in t=
he=20
Electric Power Supply Association ("EPSA"). =20

In mid-January, EPSA arranged all-day meetings for Sarah Novosel (Enron) an=
d=20
other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss=
=20
interconnection issues.  Fourteen EPSA member-companies were represented at=
=20
these meetings, and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the=20
problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate=20
interconnection agreements with utilities.  We urged the Commission to, at =
a=20
minimum, develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating=20
interconnection agreements less time consuming and more even-handed.  The=
=20
Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff=
=20
for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for=20
interconnection, and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no=
t=20
abide by the procedures for interconnection requests. =20

In the Tenn. Power order (that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee=20
Power Co. against Central Illinois, which FERC dismissed), FERC clarifies=
=20
that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests=
=20
apply equally to interconnection requests.  Furthermore, FERC states that a=
=20
utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission=20
service along with its request for interconnection service, stating that=20
these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility=
. =20
(Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit=20
transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests, and=
=20
then the utility insists on performing costly and time-consuming system=20
impact studies for the transmission service, even if the generator does not=
=20
want the transmission service).  By applying the pro forma tariff procedure=
s=20
to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept=20
interconnection requests without transmission service requests, FERC is=20
eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in=
=20
attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities.  FERC also states that=
=20
if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates,=
=20
terms or conditions of the interconnection, the transmission customer may=
=20
direct the utility to file within 30 days an unexecuted agreement with FERC=
. =20
FERC will then have 60 days to determine the just and reasonable rates, ter=
ms=20
and conditions for the interconnection service. =20

During the FERC agenda meeting on 3/15, Commissioner Massey was very please=
d=20
with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry=
=20
with needed guidance.  Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac=
h=20
develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all=20
generators requesting interconnection service, and he also encouraged the=
=20
industry to work together to develop an industry-wide pro forma=20
interconnection agreement.  EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma=
=20
interconnection agreement, so Commissioner Massey's comments could encourag=
e=20
the utility sector to begin negotiating an industry-wide standardized=20
agreement.  However, even without a standardized agreement, we hoped that=
=20
FERC's order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by=20
utilities to delay (sometimes indefinitely) the citing of new generation.

? TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING -- TECO made a FERC filing to require minute=
=20
by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission=20
system.  EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing.  Befor=
e=20
an order was issued (somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC), TECO=20
withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations. =
=20
 At this time, FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create =
a=20
"standard" generator imbalance schedule for the OATT.  FERC has said it wou=
ld=20
review the filings on a case by case basis.  FERC has not required utilitie=
s=20
to file imbalance schedules -- it "encourages" them to do so.  At this time=
,=20
only Entergy, SOCO, TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance=
=20
provisions as amendments to their OATTs.  Most utilities require this to be=
=20
"negotiated" (not much room for negotiation) in the interconnection=20
agreements.
 While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the=
y=20
can be filed "unsigned," and then protested, this can be an impractical=20
solution when building a peaker in less than one year, such as Enron has=20
done.  A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo=
re=20
friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero=
us=20
in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates.

? ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING =01) On 3/1/00, Entergy filed a proposed=
=20
interconnection policy and procedure at FERC.  EPMI protested various aspec=
ts=20
and we assisted EPSA on its protest.  Before the order was issued (again=20
fairly unprecedented), Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos=
ed=20
interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to=20
protests.  (Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this=
=20
filing.)=20

Entergy agreed to change:

Defines "required" system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect=
. =20
(EPMI and EPSA issue).  ("Required" are those such as resulting from the=20
Short Circuit/Breaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis--lik=
e=20
circuit breakers, relaying devices, system protection equipment.)

Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when "in service=
"=20
(did not go as far as EPMI argued -- that we should not be required to=20
provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have =
to=20
cut our deal.  Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives.)

Adopted EPMI's proposed "Emergency" language that loss of Entergy's=20
generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency.

Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for "non-emergencies" except=
=20
when "complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER=
C=20
or SERC or reg. agency (EPMI issue).

Changed force majeure language to match OATT.

Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short=20
Circuit/Breaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an=20
interconnection agreement is signed, although the generation projects will=
=20
remain in the queue.  This can cause the costs to vary from the 1st estimat=
e=20
to time of actual interconnection.

On 5/18/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma=20
interconnection agreement ("IA") and procedures subject to modification.  A=
s=20
I mentioned above, Entergy had adopted some of EPMI's suggestion (in EPMI's=
=20
comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of=
=20
generation.

All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not=20
included with an interconnection request.
Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve=
=20
wholesale, as well as unbundled retail.
Dismisses EPSA's call for a "model" and approves Entergy's pro forma=20
interconnection agreement, subject to modification.((The Commission stated=

for evaluating those requests.  Because an RTO will administer its pro form=

concerns about interconnection procedures." at p. 10.)
Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid=
=20
to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other=
=20
aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are=
=20
responsible for their own negligence).
Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to t=
he=20
IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions.
Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another=
=20
generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot=
=20
accommodate "receipt" of power without expansion, the new generator must pa=
y=20
costs of expansion.
Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions=
=20
are pure "interconnection" and which are applicable when=20
transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS).
Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a=
=20
specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provi=
de=20
a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an=20
explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines).
If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the=20
unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide.
Approves Entergy's credits for "optional" upgrades (required to transport=
=20
power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of=
=20
how the credits work.
Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque=
nt=20
studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more=20
intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure =
to=20
execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator ma=
y=20
be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  Thi=
s=20
is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also=
=20
post its queue on OASIS.
Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating.
Per EPMI=01,s comments, Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, un=
less=20
actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of=20
studies).
Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency=
=20
(or explain why that is inappropriate).
Per EPMI's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato=
r=20
pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system.

 ComEd Interconnection procedures -- On 3/6/00, ComEd filed interconnection=
=20
procedures.  Enron's comments were included in EPSA's protest on the=20
following issues. Proposed procedures:

1.  Submit valid request to interconnect (include # of generating units,=20
proposed max MW capacity and MVA, specific location, operational date).  Da=
te=20
and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position.  This info will be=
=20
posted on OASIS within 15 days (without listing the applicant's name).

2.  Within 30 days of the request, LOI will be tendered.  Applicant has 30=
=20
days to respond or lose queue position.  LOI authorizes commencement of=20
engineering work.

3.  Within 45 days of LOI, ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with=
 a=20
project diagram.  Study assumes interconnection of all "competing" requests=
=20
(that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs) that have=
=20
prior queue dates.

4.  Within 30 of receiving the interconnection study, Applicant must decide=
=20
whether to proceed.

5.  After Applicant decides to proceed, Applicant may have a maximum of 90=
=20
days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an=
=20
Interconnection Agreement.  Although somewhat unclear, if there is a=20
"competing" request, Applicant must exercise its ROFR within 15 days by=20
notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection=20
agreement.  If Applicant doesn't negotiate an IA-- lose queue spot.

6.  Once IA negotiations begin, Applicant has 90 days to execute it (or=20
submit dispute to arbitration).

7.  Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities=
,=20
IA must be executed.  (if generator is to come on line in < 1 year, ComEd=
=20
will negotiate an agreement (with appropriate financial safeguards) to=20
proceed before execution of the IA.)

8.  ComEd will include "reasonable milestones" that must be met in order to=
=20
maintain queue position.

My specific comments for comment:

Some items are unclear.  (1) Whether the "Decision" to proceed is made in=
=20
writing (which it should be); (2) The entire ROFR procedure (does it become=
 a=20
race to see who executes an IA faster?)
The 90 day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERC's new statemen=
t=20
in Tenn. Power  (30 days).
If ComEd won't start work until after the IA is executed, then the 30 days=
=20
needs to be adhered to (otherwise, the timetable seems too long before work=
=20
begins).
Milestones need to be specified (the current proposal contains "may" includ=
e=20
milestones, and "may" include the following...)  Also, ComEd wants to=20
"reasonably extend" the milestones.  This must be done on a=20
non-discriminatory basis.
ComEd allows itself 45 days to complete the Interconnection Study and this=
=20
can be extended in ComEd's "sole judgment."  I disagree and think it should=
=20
only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC (simila=
r=20
to the pro forma procedures now in section 19.3 re: system impact studies).

On 4/26/00, FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic=
=20
interconnection proceeding, but "encouraged" utilities to revise OATTs to=
=20
include interconnection procedures.  FERC also stated that the timelines in=
=20
the OATT for transmission system impact studies (60 days) and facilities=20
studies (60 days) are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd =
is=20
required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines.  FE=
RC=20
required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote=
st.


? FERC ORDER ON AEP=01,S INTERCONNECTION POLICY =01) On 6/29, FERC issued a=
n order=20
on AEP's proposed interconnection procedures.  EPMI participated in comment=
s=20
through EPSA.  While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe=
r=20
and Entergy interconnection procedure, there are several items of interest:

AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more=
=20
than 60 days to complete the System Impact Study.  FERC held that AEP must=
=20
commit to completing the SIS within 60 days (consistent with the pro forma=
=20
tariff), but if AEP determines it needs more than 60 days, it is required t=
o=20
notify the customer with the reasons for the delay.  FERC further stated, "=
We=20
expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques=
ts=20
to eliminate its backlog."

FERC rejected AEP's proposal to only provide transmission credits for "firm=
"=20
transmission (to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades). =
=20
FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP, non-firm PTP, or network.

Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors (since AEP would ha=
ve=20
to spend time educating the third party contractors); however, FERC=20
reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog.


? SPP Interconnection procedures  -- In 7/00, SPP filed clarifications to i=
ts=20
interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC.  EPMI participated in=20
EPSA's protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in 60 days=
=20
(or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay), instead of the 90 day=
s=20
requested by SPP.  SPP has agreed to this change (which is also consistent=
=20
with FERC's recent order on AEP's interconnection procedures.)  Also, it=20
appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi=
n=20
15 days, which is close to physically impossible, especially when SPP has n=
o=20
pro forma IA.  SPP agreed to 60 days.

 CP&L interconnection procedures -- Most recently, CP&L filed interconnecti=
on=20
procedures that ask for a 90 day study period despite the FERC orders in AE=
P=20
and SPP stating that the deadlines are 60 days.  EPSA protested with yet=20
another appeal to FERC to standardize these procedures.  FERC has not issue=
d=20
an order. =20

 The lack of standardized procedures has become problematic in just the few=
=20
months since Entergy's procedures were filed.  We are required to constantl=
y=20
monitor the notices for any procedures that have been filed, then check eac=
h=20
one carefully to determine how it deviates from the Commission's orders in=
=20
other cases.  The utilities are not required to point this out in their=20
filings (ie, no redlining from an OATT, which is required in transmission=
=20
OATT changes.)

Fiona Grant mentioned to me that you will be speaking at the Eurelectric 
meeting in Madrid on Monday and we thought that you might therefore be 
interested to see the attached note summarising the current PR situation with 
respect to our power plant developments in Spain.  

FYI Greenpeace is lobbying the Spanish Government heavily over the next few 
days in advance of the Bush visit - according to its website, will be calling 
for the Spanish Government to prohibit the development of power plants by US 
companies in protest at his policy on Kyoto.

Subject: Arcos/Tordesillas demonstrations 

This Sunday sees the demonstration in Arcos opposing the development of CCGTs 
in the region.  It is difficult to estimate likely turnout at the event - 
however the opposition Platform has been placing ads and has organised 
several buses from outside villages.  We are in contact with the Arcos Town 
Hall to see if they will be issuing official attendance numbers in advance of 
the opposition group, which can be sure to distort numbers.

Our PR consultant is in contact today with local media and will be in Arcos 
at the weekend to gauge the mood - if the demonstration does not attract many 
supporters, we will not comment publicly.  However, we will assess the 
situation on Sunday, and if there is a very large turnout, we may set up some 
interviews for Ignacio Soneira during the afternoon with local press and 
radio.  These interviews will be used to communicate that: Enron continues to 
believe in the positive benefits of the project for the region; the project 
has been subject to extensive public consultation; we have obtained our 
Environmental Impact Declaration and a large number of other permits; 
different opinions are to be welcomed in a democracy, and in fact the project 
does have support from many parts of the local community.

It is important to note that local politicians are setting great store by the 
success or otherwise of this weekend's demonstration - one key factor will be 
the ratio of Arcos residents present versus outsiders.  We will be continuing 
with our ongoing PR activities - adverts, presentations, sponsorships, 
interviews etc - next week, so that we are not seen to be backing off from 
the project following the demonstration.

Some local politicians are predicting that the level of turnout may in the 
end depend on the weather.  


Tordesillas

The demonstration which took place a few days ago in Tordesillas did attract 
a large number of local people (in the thousands).  The Tordesillas Mayor has 
now said that if local people are against the plant, then she too is against 
the project.  Our media response on this issue is that the consultation 
process is ongoing and that the Environmental Impact Report is due out within 
the next few weeks.  

The demonstration and the Mayor's position has attracted substantial local 
press coverage - the obvious concern is that these latest developments get 
picked up by newswires (one energy publication has picked up on the 
situation) and spread through Spain to Arcos.

Jackie Gentle and I will be visiting Tordesillas and Arcos next week to 
discuss the latest developments.

Kevin --

Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.

Jim

Rob, after extended negotiations with British Energy, we have verbally 
settled on:

1.  Contract drop dead date extended to December 31, 2002
2.  Contract price of C$ 41.85/MWh.
3.  A number of small amendments to the contract that we (Chris and I) are OK 
with (Chris is preparing an Amending Agreement and memo for Peter Keohane to 
review tomorrow).

I am very happy with this as it still leaves a value of C$ 107 million (US$ 
71.3 million), and it extends the contract out 13 months from the current 
drop dead.  They were initially at C$45/MWh so we were able to squeeze them 
down a fair bit.  Realistically, there was a fair chance of not getting any 
of this power as they would only have had to give Falconbridge or Dofasco or 
any industrial a call and been able to fill this at $45/MWh in a heartbeat.  
Fortunately they still see value in having a contract with us for the future 
opportunities that may come up in the marketplace.   

We have left the discussion of the put swaptions from Bruce A to a later date.

Cheers, Paul D

Enron's Negotiation Position:

As a result of the meeting, the following consensus was reached as to our 
negotiating position with Com Ed:

1.   Negotiate with Com Ed to get what we need in order to do physical deals 
in its service territory.  That translates into negotiating a modified FRP 
agreement.  (The FRP was a one year deal that some marketers signed up for in 
which Com Ed scheduled all the capacity and energy and marketers arranged 
transmission and ancilliaries).  In essence, we want a call option on 
ancilliaries of our choice to cover 2000 MW of power at a price that keeps us 
whole with our existing book of business.  (2000 MW is a negotiable amount 
that represents approximately 10% of Com Ed's peak load).  This would cover 
our existing position (approximately 5 million mwh) as well as allow us to 
grow our business.  The 2000 MW call option would not necessarily be tied to 
existing retail load, leaving us with more flexibility and options.

2.  Under Com Ed's proposal, the PPO would end in 2004, but could end earlier 
for certain large customers paying zero CTC.  In that event, the PPO should 
be replaced with a real time day ahead price into Cinergy.  For Enron's 
customers affected by losing the PPO, we would have the modified FRP 
agreement with the option to put our customers on the bundled rate.  For  
customers who lose the PPO option in the 2002 and 2004 timeframe because of 
the zero CTC, they would not be at risk for having the CTC reinstated.  In 
other words, once the utility moves customers off the PPO, Com ED loses the 
right to come back in and reinstate the CTC for those customers.

Next Steps

1.  Mark Ulrich is reviewing a comparison between the curves, the OATT and 
the the FRP to determine the ancilliary service charge we would be willing to 
pay.

2.  Rogers Herndon is reviewing the Com Ed tariffs on balancing etc.

3.  Once these action items are completed and incorporated into our 
negotiation position, I will call Frank Clark to arrange a meeting.

Guys and Gals --

Commercial wants our opinion (in fact they want us to contact the CPUC and 
legislative members) to gauge the "true" meaning of the DA bypass of the 
3c/kwh Surcharge.  This question basically has arisen because there is a 
customer that we may not re-DASR if the Surcharge bypass extends in 
perpetuity (or if at least is there a Window of Opportunity that keeps 
customers from paying).  Put in other words, would anyone give us a "free 
pass" if we move load to DA right now and promise to keep them there with no 
ability to return to electric utility service?

My current analysis looks something like this --

The term "Surcharge" is only applicable until the end of the AB1890 rate 
freeze (which will end no later than March.1.02 and may end earlier if (a) 
federal court finds in PG&E/SCE favor or (b) California legislature mandates 
an earlier end-date.  Surcharge is a "term of art" to get around the problems 
of the AB1890 rate freeze.
At the end of the AB1890 rate freeze, it is my understanding that the CPUC 
will modify fully the rate structure and level to ensure full cost recovery 
on a going forward basis (therefore Utility Retained Generation, QF expense, 
CDWR current expenses (both energy purchase and financing costs will be 
included).
Other outstanding costs will include (1) Utility Undercollection from May.00 
until when no additional CA-ISO costs are applied) and (2) CDWR costs 
beginning Jan.17.01 until the end of AB1890 rate freeze new rates.
Understanding how these costs will be recovered and by whom will most likely 
(70%) be decided by the Legislature with some decision-making by the CPUC.
Utility Undercollection Bypass - 25%
CDWR Jan.17.01 thru AB1890 end Bypass - 80% for people who never were on 
Utility Service, 10% for people who used Utility Service post Jan.17.01
CDWR Net Unavoidable Bypass - 10% for people who used Utility Service post 
Jan.17.01, 80% for others.

LEGISLATION IMPACTING THIS DECISION

There are three key direct access bills being considered (the Bowen bill - 
SB2x27, the Kelley bill - AB2x42, and the Battin bill - SB2x??).

The Bowen bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and 
replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an 
electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges [except there may 
be an entrance fee to use the electric utility going forward] and (2) if a 
customer wants to switch from an electric utility to an ESP they must pay "to 
the department any uncollected amounts equivalent to the department's net 
unavoidable cost of power procurement, including any financing costs, 
attributable to that customer" to ensure the satisfaction of any power 
purchase obligation or bond obligation to serve "that customer".  The 
recovery period shall be coincident with the terms of bonds issued to finance 
the purchases.  The CPUC has 90 days from the effective date to notify 
customers of their obligations.  

The Kelley bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in AB1x1 and 
replace it with the following (1) if a customer has not bought from an 
electric utility on or after Jan.17.01 there are no charges, (2) every 
customer is allowed to buy from an ESP a % of their load equal to the amount 
served by Utility Retained Generation (not CDWR purchases) with no charges, 
(3) after the effective date, any customer that buys from the electric 
utility and wants to switch must pay "to ensure satisfaction of any power 
purchase obligation or bond obligation incurred by the department" with the 
following constraints - (a) for res and small commercial customers, if DA 
load is less than load growth or (b) to self gen customers, if the customer 
has given 180 days prior notification or (c) if the customer has given DWR 12 
months' advance written notice (then only a fee equal to 12 months 
unavoidable costs).  The CPUC has 30 days from the effective date to notify 
customers of their obligations.

The Battin bill would ... still reviewing

CPUC DECISIONS IMPACTING THIS

May 5 Order - DA doesn't pay current DWR expenses.  Good for bypass of these 
costs.

Rick

As you know, the energy sector is facing several challenges: MAE 
intervention, rationing, drafting a new market agreement and the like. It is 
all happening as we speak.

In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders, I 
have defended correct economic  signals, have a functioning MAE, keeping 
market rules stable, creating wholesale and retail competition, honoring 
contract sanctity, and the like. More importantly, that rationing should not 
be an excuse for "revoking" supply and demand

Those are not ideologic positions only. They represent, in my view, the best 
interest for Enron in the short, medium and long terms.  We have already 
agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee. That means, I am in fact 
wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enron's best interests.

Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest (among 
many others)

a) By defending contract sanctity, we defended Elektro's contractual position 
on Annex V, which sets a formula on how financial contracts  decline during 
rationing. Simulations have indicated that our long position, even during the 
deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues. On the contraty, w/o Annex V 
loss of EBITDA may be US$ 60 million in 2001

b) By defending the integrity of MAE, spot prices and the like, we are paving 
the road for Eletrobolt's success.

Needless to say, Abraceel message has been  consistent "across the board". 
For example, if one believes on markets, we have to defend the use of market 
signals (economic incentives/penalties) during rationing. And prices to 
allocate a scarce resource. Also, as a corollary, no intervention in spot 
prices, which will, in turn, make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible.

I feel very comfortable in defending Enron's interests and wearing my 
Abraceel hat. There is a positive synergy.

However, Orlando is the President of ABRADEE, the Brazilian Association of 
Distributors. The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free 
market (seldom are); nor they are the interests of Enron. For example, 
ABRADEE as a group, criticizes the government for changing MAE governance; 
they wanted rolling black-outs instead of economic signals; they advocate 
caps on spot and the like. 

Needless to say, there is a [potential] crash here, with some internal 
reverberations.

Today,  the government announced the  rationing plan. It is based on quotas 
with an overlay of economic signals (tied to wholesale prices). This is 
consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on. However, 
ABRADEE wanted rolling black-outs.  (paving the road for eliminating MAE 
rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures)

Guess what happened? Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the 
plan and kill it. I am convinced that the government made the right decision 
(and we helped influence it)

The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV, radio and other 
media. Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces. 
Last Tuesday, I was invited to express our views to the "Minister of the 
Rationing" and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is 
elasticity in demand, MAE should work asap, intervention was necessary, 
government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot, etc. Most 
of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very 
same meeting. The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements 
of market forces. It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days 
ago, where market signals were completely neglected. (CERA has recently 
referred to it as a "step away from market forces"). And it was indeed.

Internally, we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron. 
However, the situation is getting more complicated, as tension increases. 
Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz 
Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business.

In sum, there is an internal issue going on. I do not want to be a trouble 
maker. However, I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make 
things work. (or at least to try to) Our relationship with ANEEL and with the 
powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent. I feel we should take 
advantage of it and put a stick on the ground. That is our culture. 

 I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among 
different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere (beside, we know that 
we do not want markets). That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last 
two years, with no material results. We have remained silent in key issues 
waiting for this consensus to happen. This has been the case for the market 
intervention. The market is misinterpreting our views. For example, there was 
a  press article today, stating that Enron, together with AES, were 
dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime 
(stakeholder board). What a gross misinterpretation of our views !! 
Informativo Regulatorio #  3 has conveyed  the opposite message and it has 
inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess !! They gave us the credit. We are 
still silent on our view, waiting for  consensus to happen. 

May be I am in too much of a hurry, because I am leaving soon. But I feel 
that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen (or at least 
knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon). And we are not 
taking advantage of it.

I am not expecting any immediate action from you. Just for you to be aware on 
what is going on and  share some concerns.  If you have any comments or any  
advise, please let me know.  I have even considered to resign Abraceel 
leadership to avoid future internal conflicts.

This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be 
asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty 
standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the 
baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback 
when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July 
meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put 
this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

Thank You

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Wyoming Governor Geringer has been a leader on energy issues in the West 
since (at least) the end of 2000 (when California's energy crisis pushed the 
Western Governor's Association to hold an emergency session in Denver).  
Based on discussions with his staff, it appears that the Governor likes our 
company and supports our efforts to open markets.  His public comments, which 
are developed by the Governor's office with little outside influence, match 
both the direction and intent of many of our own policy objectives.

You asked that I summarize my observations from yesterday's meeting of the 
Wyoming Energy Commission.  

I participated in the first session of the Wyoming Energy Commission at the 
Governor's invitation.  (We were invited as the keynote speaker for the 
session).  The Commission was created by the Wyoming legislature to look at 
Wyoming's energy future from the standpoint of both consumers and the 
producers.  The Commission was given a $1 million budget and authority to 
take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state.  

In conversations with the Governor's staff; it appears that they are familiar 
with commodity markets--particularly ag products.  They understand the 
concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best 
when there is adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail 
capacity.  They also understand that their are some contraints on the 
transmission system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints 
moving north, south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major 
pipeline serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and 
some problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  
While they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't 
been able to put it all together in a cohesive way.  They want our help in 
putting together the various pieces of the energy puzzle.  

I can't help but think that there is opportunity for Enron in Wyoming either 
as an advisor (for a fee) or as a business partner--e.g., there has to be 
some room for combining the energy markets--i.e., arbitraging the value of a 
coal-fired kWh and a gas-fired kWh or providing some incremental improvement 
to the market for their sale of commodity out of state.  There also may be 
some opportunity to develop coal-fired or gas-fired plant.

Indeed, Wyoming is a major producer of natural gas (including coal-bed 
methane) and coal.  They want to produce more, but want to avoid the boom and 
bust cycle of a resource dependent state.  (For example, the state moved from 
a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 to an approximately $750 million surplus in 
FY 2000).  They also want to diversify the state's economy and bring economic 
development.  For example, a major focus of the state's Business Council has 
been to recruit "server farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  
They talked about co-locating server farms and generation along the southern 
tier of the state (which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth 
available).  While it is unclear, the bandwidth they are mentioning may be 
EBS fiber.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  It's rare when you get a Governor that 
has some understanding of commodity businesses and wants to provide 
leadership on energy issues.

Jeff,

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is "clean coal" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

Mark/Kelly:

Attached is an article on Enron and our "Clean Power Group" coalition on 
multipollutant Clean Air Act legislation.   This is much more accurate than 
the WSJ article that ran last Friday, particularly on the point of CO2 caps.  
If you receive further follow-up calls or inquiries from reporters, please 
feel free to refer them to me.  If they really want a "coalition" source, you 
can give them Joel Bluestein's number at Energy & Environmental Analysis --

Electric Power Daily - May 8, 2001

Companies work to design plan for regulating air pollutants

A coalition of energy companies is devising a framework for
regulating air pollutants in a way that encourages new technologies
and protects the environment without requiring exorbitant
investments, but whether there is momentum for a regulatory
overhaul remains to be seen, according to one consultant to the
group.

Enron, El Paso Corp., Trigen, Calpine and NiSource are working on
a multipollutant strategy to replace the "piecemeal" regulatory
scheme at the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions from power plants,
said Joel Bluestein, president of Energy and Environmental
Analysis in Arlington, Va. The coalition's approach could include
carbon dioxide emissions if EPA moves to regulate that pollutant,
he said.

The coalition is meeting with lawmakers, the administration and
industry leaders in effort to garner support, said Bluestein.

"We can have secure diverse energy supply and a strong economy
if we structure the regulatory system properly," said Bluestein.
"What we are trying to do is present a framework to ensure a clean
environment with less regulation, to promote new technologies and
all fuels-including conservation and renewables, gas and coal-[and]
to provide the energy we need at reasonable prices."

The industry hoped to capitalize on momentum last year to move
the federal government toward a comprehensive yet flexible
emissions reduction program, but when President Bush reversed
his campaign position supporting restrictions on CO2 in a
multipollutant approach, that "changed the landscape a little bit,"
said Bluestein. Still, he said, the "same drivers are still there."

EPA has an acid rain program to address SO2 and a state
implementation plan program to curb NOx and in December it
announced plans to develop mercury emission restrictions for
power plants. The agency does not regulate CO2.

Mercury News, 7/3: Blackout hits Las Vegas

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


Blackout hits Las Vegas as number 120 comes up 
And California calls its first power alert since May as the mercury soars. 
July 3, 2001 
>From staff and news service reports 
Las Vegas suffered its first rolling blackout ever Monday as soaring 
temperatures and churning air conditioners outstripped the local utility's 
ability to provide electricity. 
Nevada Power Co. cut about 100 megawatts, or enough electricity for 75,000 
homes, for about an hour. 
Scattered outages were reported around the Las Vegas area, where temperatures 
reached 120 degrees. Earlier, the utility asked its major power users, 
including the neon-lit resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, for voluntary 
reductions. Casinos instituted conservation measures largely not noticeable 
by guests. 
Meanwhile, in California, high temperatures led the Independent System 
Operator to declare an emergency alert for the first time since May 31. 
A Stage 1 alert was called at 1:35 p.m. as reserves fell below 7 percent of 
demand. The alert was upgraded to a Stage 2 at 2:40 p.m., meaning reserves 
fell below 5 percent. 
The alert didn't trigger new wholesale price limits under a system recently 
ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the FERC rules, a 
Stage 1 alert must be in effect for a full clock hour (i.e., 2 to 3 p.m.) to 
reset the caps, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the ISO. Since the 
Stage 1 was upgraded to Stage 2 before a clock hour passed, that condition 
was not met, she said. The cap, designed to prevent price spikes, remains at 
$92 a megawatt-hour.

Utilities, FERC At Odds Over RTO Plans 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[News item from Energy Info Source] According to a new report from Energy 
Info Source, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has begun to 
articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations (RTOs). 
With several approvals, a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO 
application, FERC is shaping RTO participation among investor-owned 
utilities. 

Analysis: The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding 
current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO 
applications, based on decisions that the commission has made up to this 
point. According to Energy Info Source, FERC has concentrated its efforts on 
the Southeast and Western regions. Within the Southeast, FERC has essentially 
rejected Southern Company's SeTrans Gridco, while conditionally approving 
GridSouth and Grid Florida. In the West, the RTO West application-which 
represents an alliance among nine utilities-appears to have received FERC's 
favor and "is the preeminent leader among non-ISO RTO participation efforts." 
However, despite these established trends, FERC still remains at odds with 
many of the leading transmission owners in the nation, which foresee a 
potential conflict between the commission's rulemaking on transmission rates 
and its potential impact on retail rates, which are regulated by individual 
states.  

For background, an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate 
control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission 
systems within a particular region. The origins of FERC's RTO policy dates 
back to its December 1999 Order 2000, in which it strongly encouraged all 
transmission-owning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO 
by Oct. 15, 2000, with actual membership established by December of this 
year. FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received, and 
its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members 
of the commission hold. Over the last year or two, FERC has engaged in an 
ongoing debate between its preference for transco (for-profit) models for 
RTOs, as opposed to independent system operators (non-profit). Chairman Curt 
H&eacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model, while 
other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs. However, 
moving forward, it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to 
have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate, 
including the limit of one entity per region. 

As noted, FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the 
Southeast and Western regions. In addition to the obvious need to establish 
stability in the West, another explanation for the commission's dual focus is 
that other regions in the United States (namely, the Midwest and the 
Northeast) already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO, 
the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO. FERC may be focusing on the West and 
Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established 
an acceptable level of market independence. 

The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending 
before FERC. The RTO West, which FERC has referred to as the "anchor" of the 
region, has been generally accepted as a "broad concept." RTO West includes 
nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific 
Northwest (Avista, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Idaho Power, 
Montana Power, PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy, and 
the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power). BPA is by 
far the largest of the RTO West members, controlling about 75 percent of the 
transmission system in the region. For the most part, RTO West is an ISO, 
although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also 
applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella. 
The second western RTO is Desert Star, which includes utilities that are 
located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The third proposed RTO 
for the Western region is the California ISO, which has been operational 
since April 1998 and wishes to remain a stand-alone entity. 

FERC's main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its 
desire for one RTO in the area, instead of three. The primary rationale for 
this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be 
more easily managed than multiple entities. In addition, gaming by power 
generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs, which would require 
additional market rules to control the gaming (FERC's general approach has 
been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed). The 
California ISO has tweaked the commission's patience in particular, as this 
solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join 
other entities. The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps 
in California whenever reserves fall below 7.5 percent. This has been 
something that the state has long requested, but the price caps come with the 
condition that California must file an application by June 1 to enter into an 
RTO with other Western states. Otherwise, the price caps will be lifted. 
California is currently contesting this condition. 

Under the leadership of Chairman H&eacutebert, it is clearly FERC's goal to 
establish only one RTO for the entire Western region, which puts the federal 
agency at odds with the California government once again. The Department of 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares H&eacutebert's belief that one 
regional RTO is the best strategy for the West, but also has said that 
proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the 
new organization up and running. Other western governors have stood in unity 
that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone 
its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being. 

Across the country, there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the 
Southeast. For instance, Chairman H&eacutebert's preference for minimal RTOs 
within one region appears to be a national viewpoint. Yet, there are unique 
questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in 
the West. The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida 
RTO-which includes Florida Power & Light, Florida Power Corp. and Tampa 
Electric-and GridSouth RTO, which includes Progress Energy, Duke Energy and 
South Carolina Electric & Gas. However, FERC rejected Southern Company's 
SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives 
to companies other than the RTO operator, which violated FERC policy. The 
commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo, but told Southern Company not to 
re-apply and to "explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO." In 
addition, FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool / 
Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over 
control of their generation assets. The rejection and conditional approval 
from FERC, which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth, have 
been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in 
the region should join the already-approved entities. In fact, FERC 
reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would 
engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority, Santee Cooper and SeTrans 
GridCo so that they might also join. Some reports indicate that, because the 
Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model (such as the one in 
California), FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with 
its own long-term goals, which include a single RTO for the area. 

Nevertheless, despite receiving approval from FERC, GridSouth is taking issue 
with two aspects of the commission's approval. First, GridSouth questions 
FERC's jurisdiction over bundled retail service, and specifically wants the 
commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled 
transmission rates. GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a 
contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates, including the 
charge for transmission service, under FERC jurisdiction, which would allow 
the commission to change the rates in the future. FERC's Order 888, which 
essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States, clearly 
states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service. 
GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would 
agree to GridSouth's interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled 
transmission rates.  

Despite these isolated disputes, the formation of RTOs across the United 
States appears to be coming together. While the industry awaits for further 
FERC action on pending RTO applications, it is clear that certain trends are 
emerging. FERC's long-standing preference for the transco model over the ISO 
model appears to be diminishing, as evidenced by the commission's approval of 
RTO West and apparent support of non-profit operations such as the New York 
ISO and the Midwest ISO. Rather, FERC has demonstrated a more primary 
preference for solitary RTO entities within a region, regardless of whether 
the entity operates as a transco or an ISO. From a philosophical perspective, 
establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably 
will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple 
entities. Further, a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain inter-tie 
problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region. However, it 
will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in 
independent RTOs (such as California) to relinquish their autonomy and join 
forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding 
the operation of a transmission system.

Here's my list:

UK Power.  Address flaws in NETA through inter alia modifications to the 
Balancing and Settlement Code.  Value difficult to quantify, but very large 
given direct costs of high imbalance charges and resultant increase in the UK 
power curve.
UK Power.  Frustrate Ofgem's proposals for locational transmission charging 
which could cost Teesside Power up to o10m p.a. (from memory).
UK Rail.  Continue to prosecute the Competition Act complaint against EWS 
Railways.  This could reduce our rail charges by up to 25% and could create 
opportunities to grow the coal business in the UK further (eg, by unwinding 
existing long-term contracts)
UK Gas. Ofgem plan to move to hourly gas balancing which would represent a 
major risk/cost given our existing flexibility positions.  Objective is to 
shape these proposals to minimise this risk and delay/frustrate their 
introduction.
Spanish Gas/Power (Alfredo Huertas) - gas third party access for the Arcos 
project (don't know exact value, but John Sherriff has described this as his 
No. 1 priority at the moment)
Spanish Gas/Power (Alferdo Huertas) - removal of restrictions on financing 
structures on the Arcos project


I suggest the four of us work on a consolidated list when we have the 
individual lists.

Paul

This afternoon the Commission has issued an Order Requesting Comments in the 
SDG&E and LA Dept. of Water & Power petition proceedings on the short term 
capacity release price cap (RP01-180, RP01-222).

The order requests comments on "whether...[to] reimpose the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into California and the 
effects of such action on the California gas market."  Order and attachment 
are attached at the bottom of this email.  Print to read all footnotes 
(original came in WordPerfect).

Note that in footnote 2, the order explains the current comprehensive 
Commission approach to the gas market in California, and that they're 
reaching out for the gray market:  "On May 18, 2001, in Docket No. 
RM01-9-000, the Commission issued an order proposing to impose certain 
reporting requirements on natural gas sellers and transporters serving the 
California market.  The proposed reporting requirements are intended to 
provide the Commission with the necessary information to determine what 
action, if any, it should take within its jurisdiction.  Our order today 
coupled with our May 18 order continues to focus on issues related to natural 
gas prices in California and actions we may take to address capacity release 
transactions and bundled sales (i.e., the "gray market")."

To note in this order, the discussion includes an explanation that FERC 
Staff's analysis of capacity release data between Nov. 2000 and April 2001 
shows that only .09 to 1.2 percent of the volume of capacity releases into CA 
were above the maximum tariff rate.  In light of this information, the order 
requests comment on whether the price cap into California would be reimposed 
on short term releases prior to Sept. 30, 2002.

Comments are due in  20 days.  Questions asked in the order are:  (1) Would 
reimposition of the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release 
transactions into California have any significant effect on the price of gas 
at the California border; (2) Should the reimposition of the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions be limited to California 
or extended to pipelines delivering into the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) region; (3) What effect do capacity release transactions have 
on wholesale electric prices; (4) What would be the effect of reimposing the 
maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into 
California given firm shippers' ability to make bundled sales at the 
California border; and (5) How will reimposing the maximum rate ceiling for 
short-term capacity release transactions into California impact shippers' 
ability to obtain short-term firm capacity.

An excel attachment to the order details the Staff findings on Transportation 
Release Transactions above the max. rate Nov. 2000 - April 2001

Enron hires ex-TVA head Hayes, Gore friend Bone
By Andy Sher
Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON -- A potential Tennessee Valley Authority competitor has hired
former TVA director Johnny Hayes and another close Tennessee friend of Al
Gore as lobbyists.

Congressional lobbyist records show that Mr. Hayes, who was the Gore 2000
presidential campaign's fund-raising director, registered with the House
clerk on May 1 to lobby for Houston-based Enron Corp.

Nashville attorney Charles W. Bone, another longtime Gore supporter,
registered to lobby for Enron the same day.

Enron is the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity. It is
headed by Kenneth Lay, a major financial supporter of President George W.
Bush, who defeated Democrat Gore last year.

Mr. Hayes served on the board of TVA, a federal utility, from 1993 until
January 1999, when he went to work for the Gore campaign.

In an interview, Mr. Hayes said his activities are between himself and his
clients.

"I haven't done anything wrong, won't do anything wrong and won't do
anything to hurt TVA," he said, also noting that it has been more than a
year since he left TVA.

Former TVA directors are subject to a one-year ban against seeking to
influence TVA on any matter, according to a summary of post-employment
activity laws supplied by the agency.

"I won't have any comment," Mr. Bone said in a phone message. "I never talk
about what I'm doing for clients."

Stephen Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a
TVA watchdog and environmentalist group, said that while he knows Mr. Hayes
is an "honorable man," there are potential problems with a former TVA
insider going to work for Enron. Mr. Hayes "knows where the skeletons are
buried," Mr. Smith said.

"It's a classic. You got somebody who's a TVA board member who leaves to go
to work for someone who for all practical purposes is a competitor. I think
everybody in the valley should be a little concerned about it. ... I just
think folks need to come out on the record and say exactly what they're
doing. What they may be doing may be completely admirable."

Enron spokesman Eric Thode said Mr. Hayes was hired to lobby on "energy
issues, TVA-related, kind of a host of issues."

"TVA is one group he might work with," Mr. Thode said. He declined to say
how much Mr. Hayes is being paid. Enron spent $800,000 last year on its own
Washington lobby organization and hired other lobbyists as well -- one group
for $415,000.

TVA spokesman Gil Francis said he spoke to Mr. Hayes last Friday.

"And what he said was he has talked to some TVA staff on some TVA matters
and that is all he said," Mr. Francis said. He said the conversations were
with TVA power division staffers in Chattanooga.

In his lobbyist registration form for Enron, Mr. Hayes said he was lobbying
on "Power Plant Development/Utility deregulation."

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Enron was using its
Democratic contacts to "strengthen ties" to Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky
Democrat who serves on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The Journal reported that Mr. Hayes, who knew Ms. Breathitt through national
Democratic politics, invited her to a dinner at a Washington restaurant to
meet Enron's managing director for government affairs, Richard Shapiro.

Enron's Mr. Thode confirmed the account but provided little additional
information. The Journal said Enron wants FERC to restructure the electric
utility industry so that utilities such as TVA, which controls transmission
on its lines, will open their lines to everyone.

Mr. Thode said Mr. Hayes was not involved in Enron's recent settlement of a
dispute with TVA. It involved allegations that Enron had not lived up to a
contract to supply TVA fixed amounts of power during period of heavy demand.

According to Mr. Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, TVA
received $200 million under the settlement -- an amount Mr. Thode and TVA's
Francis both refused to confirm, saying it was confidential.

Mr. Hayes also is registered to lobby for Choctaw Gas Generation, a
subsidiary of Tractebel Power Inc. of Houston, which built a lignite
coal-fired plant in Mississippi for TVA. He also is registered to lobby with
Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation Inc., which is based in York, Pa., and
has a Chattanooga office.

In all three cases, Mr. Hayes registered under the company name of Sideview
Partners Inc.

Mr. Bone also is registered to lobby for Voith Siemens. He registered under
Wyatt, Tarrant and Combs, a Nashville law firm.

Mr. Hayes remains involved in politics. He is Democratic gubernatorial
hopeful Phil Bredesen's lead fund-raiser -- a nonpaid post.

FYI.  El Paso Merchant is advocating the gathering of financial information 
on the gas markets.  As Leslie says, this may be their quiet method of 
highlighting the role of Enron in the market.

		 Subject: El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements 
docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, 
but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be 
gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial 
market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso 
suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for 
the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in 
California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let 
me know if you want a copy faxed.

Peter,

The 29th is fine with me.

All - Please see attached spreadsheet, I needed to finalise our current 
estimate budget. I have reduced Salary and Wages for new headcout of 24. The 
new Total is $11,596,191 which is down by $294,852 from the version in the 
meeting with Michael Brown.

I have left Travel and Entertainment the same with the view that we can 
revise in the next Forecast (late June). I spoke to Doug briefly regarding 
this.  I am sure come June you will be in a good position to make further 
changes .    

We have previously spoken about showing one of the assistants how to run 
simple SAP reports. I'd like to show Merle Glen early next week if you are 
all in agreement that she is the most appropriate.

Thanks
Greg

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
"Environment" nor "Environmental policy and compliance". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our "Chief Environmental Officer". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

Nick -- This certainly reflects the discussion you and I had on the telephone 
on Friday and seems like a good plan going forward.  I was surprised to hear 
that Mike has been directing such a large percentage of his focus towards EBS 
matters (I do not recall being told of this arrangement  by Jan or Mark) but 
I appreciate having the support in Japan and Mike can be quite helpful in 
taking a look at  Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea as well.  He has been doing a 
decent job and we will reevaluate again later in the year his ongoing support 
of EBS in the region.  Thanks for the follow up.

On another matter, I am working on lining up one brief meeting for Jeff 
Skilling while he is in Tokyo on 14 May -- Jim Weisser and I will coordinate 
with you.  Thanks for your help on these matters.

Anthony, good speaking with you last week. This note is to confirm a couple 
of matters regarding Mike.

With the departure of David Merrill in January this year, Mark Schroeder 
moved Mike across to cover EBS regulatory work more or less on full time 
basis. Although the time varies from week to week,  Mike currently spends 
about 75% of his time on EBS matters. The balance is charged out to Enron 
Japan and other Enron entities with an interest in Japan, such as Networks 
and Global Markets.

At the same time, Mike's expat assignment was extended for an additional 6 
months until 31 December 2001. The possibility of extending the assignment 
beyond 31 December 2001 was discussed in general terms and will be a matter 
for consideration by the interested parties at the appropriate time.

To date, Mike has been covering Japan only, reporting to Jan Haizmann on EBS 
regulatory matters. Following our discussion, Mike's responsibilities will 
extend to include South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mike is of course happy 
to extend his responsibilities. Once the new regulatory hire is on board in 
Singapore, Mike will report to that person on EBS regulatory matters. Mike 
will continue to have a dual reporting role on regulatory issues related to 
Japan.

If this accords with your understanding, particularly the preceding 
paragraph, I will send a copy of the note to personnel, Joe Hirl and Rick 
Shapiro.

kind regards

Rick, Linda and I met with Dan Larcamp (Director of FERC's Office of Markets, 
Tariffs and Rates) yesterday.  He made several comments of interest:

Enron's Position on Market Structure

Dan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like "PJM."  Dan would 
like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his 
staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:  

 - what brings liquidity
 - what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end 
use customers -- how does    liquidity benefit consumers?
 - why do we support PJM over New York and New England
 - what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right 
signals to generators of where to site 


Gas Pipeline Issues

Dan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He 
said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree 
that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said 
he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want 
to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if 
pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through 
options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this 
provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  

Regulatory Gap

Dan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and 
the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily 
bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We 
discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still 
concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.

He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or 
staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has 
been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat 
defensive in response to those comparisons.

Open Access

Dan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up 
will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in 
the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention 
California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get 
California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC 
needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not 
be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.

EPSA 

Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are 
most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed 
concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for 
the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the 
Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result 
(lower prices).

Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he 
and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like 
to visit with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the 
foregoing.

Sarah

Wanda, Vladi - Dave Foti described the interest rate hedge for a few of us in 
Govt Affairs yesterday.  He said you wanted feedback from us before you 
completed the process.  I raised a few issues with Dave, and since he is out 
today and I will be in Calgary next Monday/Tuesday on business, here are my 
issues:

The $17 million MTM essentially amounts to monetizing an expected decrease in 
regulated distribution and transmission rates.  Two assumptions seem to be 
driving this: 

 1) net T&D plant will not grow as fast relative to sales as it has in the 
past.  Stated another way, load growth will be met by less new investment.  
Dave was going to quantify the effect.  Given the push for increased T&D 
reliability, this assumption is not intuitive and seems to be at odds with 
our own business strategy of using energy efficiency and distributed 
generation to lessen electric sales.

2) regulated utility capital structures will become more debt-oriented 
relative to equity than they are now (move to 60/40 from 50/50).  This is a 
reasonable
assumption, but the change is likely to occur over time and not instantly.  I 
do not know how quickly this change is reflected in the model.

Regulatory assumption on how long frozen rates are in place and how often 
rate cases occur appear reasonable.  I would just note several of our 
significant positions are behind utilities with Performance-based Rates and I 
am not aware of how these have been modelled.  

As an aside, it would be useful to know how much of the regulated T&D 
position is actually hedged by interest rates - in other words, how much of 
the T&D rate is actually comprised of utility return on investment.  I'm 
guessing this is about 25 - 35% or so.

Dave and others working on this project have done a lot of great work here 
and with answers on the above issues we would be on board.

I can be reached via Rubena Buerger, x31516.

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing 
today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation 
and other related energy issues.  The "star witness" was Gov. Davis.  Others 
were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps, 
Sens. Murkowski, Murray and Cantwell, Washington State's attorney general, 
Oregon's PUC chairman, and the five FERC commissioners.  Once Davis left 
after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions, most of the 
press and audience left.

Enron was mentioned several times as follows:

 1. Sen. Thompson, the Ranking Republican, mentioned Lockyer's "Spike" 
comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make 
new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty, there 
is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials.  
Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not.  (Thompson gave him a 
second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific 
reference again to "Spike," asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of 
the AG's Spike comments.)  The first time Davis said that the people he 
represents are mad, they want him to fight back, this is rough business, the 
industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment, things occassionally 
get out of hand, and we are not going to take it.  On the second instance, he 
said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not 
being diminished.

 2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his 
handling of the situation, using quotes from California newspapers to make 
the case that Davis was slow to act.  He also argued that the state had done 
a bad job as a power purchaser, contrasting the state's recent 8-year 
contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with 
Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50.  The 
Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but 
is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more.  Davis 
said they should make refunds, too.

 3. While not saying Enron by name, Gov. Davis did make a comment about 
companies with "trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange 
with meteorologists and very talented people" who might have the ability to 
find loopholes in the new order.  He said this in answer to a question about 
what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued, and he said "watch 
out for manipulation" by those subject to the order.

 4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared 
to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small 
percentage of the market in her state, with lots of document requests and 
other investigative action, while not doing the same to others.  During that 
exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had 
over $1 billion in sales to Washington State.  Enron was not on the list of 
companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands.  
She said she would be expanding her inquiry, though.

Highlights and Analysis

 1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing, the mantra from the 
Western Democrats was: we want our money back.  Chairman Lieberman and others 
pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other 
Western states, particularly Oregon and Washington.  Chairman Hebert said 
that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all 
issues, including refunds in California and outside California.  He said that 
the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on 
itself, including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act.  
Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's 
activities in implementing the new order, particularly as it relates to 
refunds.  While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to 
pending cases, he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day 
delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds.

 2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and 
enforcement tools available to the commission, including the ability to order 
short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business, 
treble damages, and other administrative penalties.  There was also 
discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's 
market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC, FCC and 
FTC than it has in the past.

 3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's 
latest order is a step in the right direction.  None of them called for 
legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith.  
Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated 
price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that 
the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at 
yesterday's hearing.  Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates 
are better, but he said the new order is "some price relief" and that it 
corrected the mistakes in the April order.

 4. There was some discussion of natural gas again.  Davis said that FERC 
should now turn its attention to natural gas.  He said that El Paso 
controlled too much of the capacity until recently.  He called on FERC to 
enforce laws against price manipulation.  (Note: we have had several back 
channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso 
and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.)

 5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order.  
Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon.  
Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not 
more time and that order should apply until California has enough new 
generation in place.  Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman 
later in the hearing, saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on 
new supplies, however he and the others basically said they would revisit the 
issue if events warrant.

 6. Several times, Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support 
deregulation, but that the effort to get more states to do so will never 
happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public 
confidence restored.

 7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood, 
saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to 
California, including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of 
transportation to California.  He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that 
FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush 
appointees were on the commission.

 8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the 
FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices.  She said not to her 
knowledge even though she has asked them to do so.  We can expect a 
Lieberman, et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward, I 
suspect.

 9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature 
of his normal thoughtful tone, it is clear that he and others see this as a 
major issue for them to ride.  He commended FERC at the end of the hearing 
for doing their best, but pledged he would stay involved, closing the session 
with a smile and the words "see you soon."

Subject: RE: As per our discussion  

I should add to Paul D's explanation a footnote re help for Alfredo on Italy. 
I have agreed with Alfredo, Paul D, Paul Mead and Eric Shaw that Nailia 
Dindarova will spend approx. 30% of her time between now and the end of this 
year supporting Alfredo on Italian electricity market regulatory work. For 
this purpose Paul Mead will find a desk next to the Italian market traders 
for Nailia, and she will spend up to three days each week in London rather 
than Brussels over the six month period.

Sounds fine to me.  I've followed up with Alfredo, Peter and Doug, re, David 
Gonzalez.  I think our preference would still be to keep David for another 
six months, while accepting that this does carry some risk in terms of 
employment rights issues.  David fills a valuable hole currently that it 
would be very difficult to plug in the short term.  That said, it will be 
made clear to David that this is a final renewal and that he may want to 
explore opportunities elsewhere within or outside of Enron.  Meanwhile, 
Alfredo is committed to using the six month period to recruiting someone 
permanent to help him out on Spanish and Italian issues.

Regards,

Paul

All,

I have interviewed Esther, twice, and on both occasions reccomended that we 
did not hire, so would not be supportive of moving her into the group as I do 
not believe she has either the capaiblity to communicate effectively in 
English or the business knowledge to make her useful to you.

against running the piece today,  after a discussion with Dave Goulding, CEO 
of the IMO.   Goulding had evidently told him that there was no immediate 
urgency to  the gov't announcing a date.  Dave's concern is that if we press 
for a date now we may get the one we don't want (i.e. Spring 2002 rather than 
November 2001).  I told Corcoran that I understood Dave's concern but that 
there was a need for an early indication from the gov't  that they were 
targeting November in order that we maintain momentum among those bodies 
(primarily the distributors) which bear the primary responsibility to get the 
needed systems in place.  Eric Thode is forwarding a copy to John L.

Chris:  Following up on my earlier email which reported on the comment made 
by IPSCO's CEO at the steel conference that "traders should be held legally 
responsible for what's going on"......it appears that there is a push by the 
domestics to change the trade laws to "obtain relief from injury caused by 
traders who facilitate dumping."   In a speech to the Steel Caucus last fall, 
LTV's Chairman stated that " International steel traders and foreign steel 
producers are becoming ever more sophisticated -- and brazen -- in their 
evasion and circumvention of U.S. trade laws."  

We need to keep a close eye on their lobbying efforts in Washington.   I am 
especially concerned about this in light of Nucor's comment to Jeff McMahon 
that Enron's activities may be "illegal."   [FYI, I have discussed this with 
Julia Murray and Betsy Hafner (PGFM), and they don't agree with Nucor's 
allegation.]   Having said that, they are totally paranoid about Enron's 
entry into the steel market, and I want to make certain that we're not the 
subject of an unfair trade investigation.

Let's get together with Betsy to discuss as soon as she returns from India.   
Thanks.

		 Subject: Statement at AISI conference

Lisa,
 
Andy asked me to investigate the statement at the AISI conference regarding
traders.  I have attached an AISI policy statement calling on Congress to
enact reforms to U.S. trade law and listing, as one example, reforms that
would make it possible to  obtain relief from injury caused by traders who
facilitate dumping (number "(5)" under "Positive trade law provisions").
Thus, it appears that AISI is advocating for a change in U.S. trade law as
opposed to claiming that traders are subject to anti-dumping duties under
existing law.  I have also attached a statement by the AISI Vice-Chairman
referring to injury caused by traders (fifth paragraph and first bullet
point of the ninth paragraph). 
 
Thank you,
Leslie

May 21st - check in with you -- at that time if I have decided against making 
the change, we will begin to discuss reshaping my responsibilities.  
Otherwise, we will proceed with the following.
May 21st through June 21st - work part-time with Friday's and part of 
Monday's in the office.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday work from Cleveland. ( 
I would expect to be open to do some limited travel -- it would depend on the

=09=09 Subject: Briefing on FERC CA Natural Gas Infrastructure conference

This memo by Nancy Bagot, ETS, and Donna Fulton, Enron Corp, summarizes wha=
t=20
we heard at yesterday's FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue =
in=20
California on the gas side.

The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept=
=20
to very technical, facility and service issues.  Staff did not allow any=20
discussion of pricing, because that would be handled in other forums.=20
Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference, though some of=
=20
their staffers were in attendance.

Like many FERC Technical Conferences, the May 24th conference on California=
=20
Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming=20
other parties for the situation in the California market.  Generally, (1)=
=20
interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed, both=
=20
to California and within California   (and some blame SoCalGas=01, lack of=
=20
adequate take-away capacity, failure to provide open access transmission, a=
nd=20
allocation procedures), (2) SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that,=20
although this is a tight year, service commitments will be met and things a=
re=20
fine, and (3) the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going=
=20
forward, that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas=20
issues in California, and  that CPUC =01&decisions are coming.=018 =20

For FERC Staff, there are two issues at hand: is the problem the mismatch=
=20
between interstate and intrastate capacity (and what amount of infrastructu=
re=20
should be added into and within California), and/or is it the allocation=20
methodology at a few highly-constrained delivery points into the state. =20
Overall, there is basic agreement that there are problems with both.

The State

Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as=20
adequate with just minor changes and enhancements, certainly to serve core=
=20
customers and likely to serve non-core customers.  Like the LDCs, the state=
=20
representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a=20
difficult year may not bode well for facilities in =01&normal=018 years in =
the=20
future, leaving intrastate capacity stranded.  Also, both agencies ticked o=
ff=20
a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes=
=20
that are designed to improve the delivery system.  According to the CPUC an=
d=20
CEC, demand in the state is not going to explode =01) getting LDC storage b=
ack=20
up to normal levels should make the difference.

FERC Staff questioned  the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation=
s=20
of the state LDC systems, allocation methods, and the availability of firm=
=20
capacity on SoCalGas in particular.  There was great concern among Staff=20
about the inability for a non-core customer to contract for specific capaci=
ty=20
for primary firm service on SoCal.  The CPUC noted that there is a=20
comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a=
nd=20
allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system, but the=20
Commission has not yet acted on that settlement.  When asked why the CPUC h=
as=20
not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year, the witness=
=20
said that there were not three votes.

The LDCs

Only PG&E and SoCalGas appeared before FERC.  Both were adamant that there=
=20
was adequate capacity for current demand, as proven by the lack of =20
curtailments over the past year.  They also agree that a primary question i=
s=20
how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity =01) though it=01,s general=
ly held=20
there should be a 15-20% excess, is that for a normal weather year or a dry=
=20
hydro year? =20

For SoCal in particular, Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the=
=20
next five years, with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would=
=20
bypass their system (being built directly along interstates pipelines).  If=
=20
capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin, he wanted to know wh=
o=20
would pay for the capacity.  The central policy question for SoCal comes do=
wn=20
to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin=
g=20
interstate capacity or customer demand (based on contracts).  SoCal believe=
s=20
it should respond to the latter.  However, the LDC cites the CPUC as an=20
obstacle for responding to customers, and is looking to the CPUC to accept=
=20
its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for=
=20
tradable primary capacity rights.

For PG&E, the situation is different because it functions very much like an=
=20
open access interstate pipeline. It does not have the allocation and=20
scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system; however, there is still a=
=20
mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity.  PG&E, like SoCal,=20
claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand, though they are=
=20
planning some enhancements. They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in=
=20
planning for uncertainty, but in general the northern California LDC is not=
=20
facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart.

Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system=
,=20
as nearly all questions focused on SoCal=01,s allocation method, firm capac=
ity=20
availability for non-core customers (which include industrials and electric=
=20
generation) and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems=
. =20
FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and=
=20
Wheeler Ridge, and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor=
e=20
interstate capacity.  SoCal consistently answered that its proposed=20
comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues, but the=
=20
CPUC will not act on it.

Interstate Pipelines

With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and=
=20
four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table, the pipelines call to ar=
ms=20
was for more capacity into the state.  Demand projections by the pipeline=
=20
representatives were vast and optimistic, an example being the Sonoran=20
Pipeline prediction of a 3 =01) 4 Bcf shortfall.  And each pipe can point t=
o=20
booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure. =
=20
Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas=01, lack =
of=20
capacity and the major problem of allocation =01) SoCal currently can only =
offer=20
secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity. =20

FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof=
=20
that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity.  SoCal=20
responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will=
=20
only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes=01,=
=20
allocations.  The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand=
=20
forecasts of the LDCs, CPUC & CEC, and the pipelines.

Others

The financial community (Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch) pointed to a=20
dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv=
en=20
certainty on returns and the regulatory structure.  The message was for FER=
C=20
to stay the course, without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat=
e=20
rules, and for California to fix itself, especially the CPUC (the weakest=
=20
link).

Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers=01, rights are=
=20
protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be=20
stranded.  There is concern over additional capacity into constrained=20
delivery points that are already pro rationed, especially in light of the=
=20
recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge. =20

The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal=
=20
will be unloaded by bypassing EG.  They claimed that there are disincentive=
s=20
in California regulation to SoCal's building capacity - specifically the=20
Performance-based Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism.  Und=
er=20
these programs, SoCal gets to keep 50% of peaking service revenues, thus=20
giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services.  SoCal gets=
=20
to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms.=20

Closing Staff Concerns

To wrap up, FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always=
=20
discussed, and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock=
=20
has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California.  However, wi=
th=20
allocation changes at Topock kicking in, the problems are moving to Wheeler=
=20
Ridge.

There was also a debate over which is the real problem =01) intrastate capa=
city=20
or intrastate scheduling.  SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity=
=20
issue but the mechanism (blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling=20
settlement), California Generators believe it=01,s all about capacity (blam=
e=20
SoCalGas).

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: June 29, 2001

RE: Draft Letter to FERC Commissioners Regarding Alliance
      RTO Stakeholder Process and Interconnection Agreement

Attached is a draft letter addressed to the FERC Commissioners concerning the 
collaborative stakeholder process of the Alliance RTO (ARTO).  As you are 
aware, EPSA sent a letter in April to the ARTO transmission owners outlining 
our concerns with the development of the ARTO stakeholder process.  The ARTO 
subsequently made its compliance filing to FERC in May describing the 
progress of the collaborative stakeholder process.  Many parties filed 
comments outlining the flawed progress and their inability to provide 
meaningful stakeholder input to the ARTO.

Most recently, the ARTO removed all system upgrade transmission crediting 
provisions from the latest draft Interconnection Agreement and 
Interconnection Procedures covered during the June 7-8, 2001 collaborative 
meeting.  We are concerned that such an action will have grave effects on 
generation and is clearly inconsistent with FERC precedent.  We are also 
concerned with the ARTO's commitment to uphold its interests in the Inter-RTO 
Cooperation Agreement ("Cooperation Agreement") to form a common pro forma 
Generator Interconnection Agreement with the MISO.

We intend to send the letter to the FERC Commissioners as well as all parties 
in the active docket.  The letter will be signed by EPSA, but if individual 
generators would also like to sign on, please let us know.  If you have any 
comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or at eperrigo@epsa.org 
by noon EST on Tuesday, July 3rd.

Rick, I am happy top take over the responsibility to sign the DASH. However, 
I query what a signature from the regulatory group implies given that the 
DASH does not include a regulatory risk assessment.

kind regards

U.S. Steel Producers Make
Concerted Push for Section 201 Case

U.S. steel industry officials appearing before the House Steel Caucus March 
21 were unanimous in calling for an investigation under Section 201 of the 
1974 Trade Act but some officials warned that any limits on steel imports 
must be comprehensive so that circumvention does not occur. 
"To be effective, the [import relief] must cover all imports, including 
semifinished products," Nucor Corp. Chief Financial Officer Terry Lisenby 
urged. 
Terrence D. Straub, vice president, government affairs, USX-US Steel Group, 
said that the industry needs a sustained period of import stability to 
recover from damage and to address structural issues. "The restraints [which 
could be imposed under Section 201] should reduce finished steel imports 
across the board from non-[North American Free Trade Agreement] countries to 
pre-crisis levels, and they should remain in force until the fundamental 
structural problems have been successfully addressed," he said. The 
restraints must not replace relief under the antidumping and countervailing 
duty laws, he said. 
Section 201, known as the safeguard statute, allows the president to 
temporarily restrict imports of an investigated product if the International 
Trade Commission finds that surging imports are a substantial cause of 
serious injury to the U.S. industry. U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. 
Zoellick has said that the Bush administration is seriously considering a 
Section 201 investigation in steel . 
The U.S. steel industry was broadsided by an unprecedented import surge in 
1998. Imports dropped in 1999 but began rising again in 2000. 
George Becker, former president of the United Steel Workers of America, 
called for immediate passage of H.R. 808-a bill that would roll back steel 
imports for five years. If immediate relief is not provided to the steel 
industry, "there will simply be no more steel industry," he said. 
Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.), vice chairman of the caucus and a key sponsor 
of H.R. 808, announced that the measure had garnered over 100 cosponsors. 
H.R. 808 would also enhance the Steel Loan Guarantee program by providing 
cash strapped steel firms with loans. 
While expressing support for other provisions of H.R. 808, Nucor's Lisenby 
said that inefficient mills should be allowed to go out of production. Nucor 
opposes any bail out of legacy costs of these firms or any other type of 
subsidies, he said. 
Witnesses agreed that world steel overcapacity was a major problem for the 
industry. Specialty Steel Industry of North America Chairman H.L. Kephart 
warned that foreign steel producers are planning to add 7.4 million tons of 
new production capacity in the next five years. "This is three times the 
total annual U.S. consumption of stainless steel coming online by 2005," he 
said. Since most of this new production cannot be absorbed by foreign 
markets, the United States will be targeted for large increases in stainless 
steel imports, he said.

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

I suspect that I am not going to receive a birthday present or Christmas card 
from this fellow.  What do you think?  This is the type of e-mail that we 
usually receive from our friends in California.  Looks like the disease is 
spreading to other areas.

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!

Oh yee of little faith. Dawson - when can we go to DTI and make big stink??

Solomon Bros reports:

E.ON / POWERGEN - The Guardian reports that the UK government is looking
into ways to block or hold up foreign takeovers of British energy companies.
Separately, E.ON says it now has a majority stake in Sydkraft.

Here are some thoughts on what our message may be.=20

Unclear how this is going to increase supply, decrease demand, and increase=
=20
customer choice.  Still doesn't make sense to us to have the state buy a=20
crumbling transmission network instead of school lunches.

We don't have enough details.  There are several aspects that are interesti=
ng=20
and could use further study.  Governor Davis needs to make the details publ=
ic=20
as soon as possible so people can understand the full implications.  For=20
instance, what happens to DWR contracts?  Will they be assigned to SCE?  Wi=
ll=20
customers have the right to choose going forward?

The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers c=
an=20
make their own energy decisions going forward.  We know that Government=20
doesn't know how to get this right.  The right answer is giving customers=
=20
more choices, not fewer.

Can't endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full.  =
If=20
the bills aren't paid in full, highly likely that we'll see involuntary=20
bankruptcy.

Too bad that this deal wasn't done earlier.  It could have saved alot of=20
money and pain.

Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal?  May nev=
er=20
happen.  Make it easy - just deal with the under collection through=20
securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it.

approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus=20
approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
? Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3=
=20
billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
? Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings a=
nd=20
filed rate doctrine cases.
? CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical=
=20
principles of ratemaking.
? Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that=20
represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1,=
=20
2001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s fa=
ilure to=20
pay the QF=01,s).  SCE will securitize this amount.
? Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou=
nt=20
(approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.=
e.=20
two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).

? The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the=20
signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected=
=20
amount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the=

net undercollected amount.
? The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=

***************************************************************
HOLLINGS FAVORS SMALLER COMMERCE COMMITTEE;
INOUYE SET TO RETAKE COMMUNICATIONS GAVEL

It's still too early in the Senate transition game to tell which
issues -- telecom related or not -- will come to a head under a
Democratic-led Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
But incoming Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.) already has
singled out one item for immediate attention -- downsizing the
Commerce Committee.

The panel gained two seats for a total of 22 at the outset of the
107th Congress.  Under a Senate "power-sharing" pact that went
into effect last January, all the committees were drawn up to
reflect the Senate's 50-50 split between Democrats and
Republicans (TR, Jan. 15).

But with Sen. James Jeffords's (R., Vt.) departure from the GOP
expected to take effect this week, Democrats are pushing a new
reorganization plan that would give them a one-seat advantage on
each committee.  For the Commerce Committee, Sen. Hollings
prefers trimming a Republican from the panel rather than adding a
Democrat, his spokesman said.

"He feels the Commerce Committee is starting to get too large and
plans to work with [incoming Majority Leader Thomas A.] Daschle
[D., S.D.] to come up with a final determination," the spokesman
told TR today.

It is too early to discuss specific Commerce Committee agenda
items for the remainder of the year, the Hollings spokesman said.
But before he begins pushing an agenda, Sen. Hollings will confer
with current Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.),
he added.

"While the committee's priorities have yet to be determined, the
style in which they work won't be changing," the spokesman said.
"Clearly, Sens. McCain and Hollings have a long-standing, working
relationship. . .and cover issues that transcend party lines.
They pride themselves on moving things out of that committee in
bipartisan fashion, and that isn't going to change," he added.

On the telecom front, Sen. Hollings is in line to become chairman
of the communications subcommittee, but he's not expected to
assume that post.  Instead, the subcommittee's gavel likely will
return to Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (Hawaii), who last held the top
spot there in 1994.

A Hollings-Inouye pairing would be good news for those who don't
want Congress to overhaul the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Earlier this year, Sens. Inouye and Hollings were two of four
senators who called on FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell to maintain
the "strict adherence and strong enforcement" of the local
market-opening mandates spelled out in sections 251 and 271 of
the Act (TR, April 30).

Sen. Inouye also has pressed the FCC for quick action on
Northpoint Technologies Ltd.'s applications to operate in the Ku-
band (TR, May 28), and he was an original cosponsor to a bill, S
414, to set up a new telecom program to be administered by the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (TR, March 5).

For current communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns
(R., Mont.), the loss of the gavel shouldn't disrupt the rollout
of his "tech seven" agenda of telecom and Internet issues, his
spokeswoman said.  "It's still his top priority," she said.  Sen.
Burns "enjoys a good working relationship with [Sen.] Hollings
and feels they'll move the tech seven agenda."


***************************************************************
TECH COALITION BACKS BUSH's CALL
TO EXTEND CHINA's TRADE STATUS

A coalition of groups representing telecom equipment and high-
tech companies today said Congress should extend normal trade
relations (NTR) status with China for another year.  The U.S.
High-Tech Industry Coalition said it "strongly endorsed"
President Bush's call for such an extension.

Extending China's normal trade status would "protect current U.S.
high-tech investments and businesses in China, thus enhancing
opportunities for increased market access once China formally
joins the World Trade Organization," the coalition said.  China
is "moving toward completing" all of its accession procedures for
joining the WTO, it added.

The coalition includes the AeA (formerly the American Electronics
Association), the Computer & Communications Industry Association,
Information Technology Association of America, Information
Technology Industry Council, and the Telecommunications Industry
Association.


***************************************************************
HEALTH RESEARCHERS TO SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER USE OF PRIVATE
CELLPHONE RECORDS

The group that led a six-year, $27 million industry-funded effort
to study the health effects of mobile phones has agreed to settle
a class-action lawsuit.  The suit was filed in 1995 on behalf of
mobile phone users who claimed their privacy was invaded.  Their
phone records were reviewed without their permission as part of
the research project, the plaintiffs said.

Wireless Technology Research LLC has agreed to turn over the
remaining $1.4 million of a $2 million insurance policy that the
wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation.
As part of the settlement agreement, $250,000 of those funds will
be set aside to fund a voluntary, surveillance registry to assess
whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses.

The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L. Carlo, who had
a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of
failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between
mobile phone use and adverse health effects.  The settlement also
reserves $150,000 for future legal expenses of Mr. Carlo and WTR.

In addition, mobile phone subscribers included in the class would
get a 50% discount on a book Mr. Carlo co-authored last year,
"Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards in the Wireless Age."

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in "Jerald P. Busse et al. v.
Motorola, Inc. et al." (case no. 95 CH 10332) have asked the Cook
County, Ill., Circuit Court to hold a hearing Thursday on the
proposed settlement.  If the court approves the agreement, WTR
would be dropped from the lawsuit, but other defendants from the
wireless industry would remain.

An aide for Mr. Carlo told TR today he couldn't discuss the
settlement until it is finalized.  Michael F. Altschul, senior
vice president-policy and administration and general counsel for
the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is
a defendant in the case, also declined to comment, saying
industry attorneys were reviewing the proposed settlement.


***************************************************************
CLEC ASKS FCC TO STAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION ORDER

Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) Core Communications,
Inc. (CoreTel) has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a
recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules.  The new
rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for
connecting calls to Internet service providers (ISPs).  CoreTel
said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets.

CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common
Carrier dockets 96-98 and 99-68 (TR, April 23).  One is the ban
on carriers' receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating
calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of
the order.  The other is the "growth cap" provision, which limits
annual increases in a carrier's reciprocal compensation revenue.

The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular
geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation
revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap, while hampering
new CLECs, CoreTel noted.  That situation puts new CLECs entering
those markets at an "extreme competitive disadvantage," it said.

"The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new
rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established

CoreTel said.  It will suffer "irreparable harm" if the
provisions aren't stayed pending judicial review, the company
added.

For those of you who might be interested, William Simon, a  Republican 
candidate for governor in California, spoke to the Sacramento Press  Club at 
a lunch I attended today.? Simon is the son of the late William E.  Simon, 
the former Treasury Secretary.
?
During his presentation, he made a few comments abou the  energy situation 
in?CA:
?
A former U.S. attorney and Rudy Guiliani protege, it bothers  him that Gov. 
Davis has made a point of prejudging generators and marketers  before 
investigations are complete (Simon supports full investigations into  
generator/marketer practices).? He also called Bill Lockyer's "Spike" quote  
inappropriate, and said it violates the canon of ethics to threaten  
prosecution.
?
He believes it is a mistake to buy the transmission lines and  that the focus 
should be on increasing supply.? The rhetoric coming from  the governor and 
AG "do nothing but chill investment," and said he doesn't blame  Mirant for 
its hesitation to build new plants.
?
If the current energy situation were in his lap, he would  approach?it by 
getting everybody to the table?to try to find an  overall solution.? It's 
being done piecemeal now, he said, and that's not  effective.
?
He sees three elements to?addressing the  problem:
1.? Limit state involvement -- he does not support a  public power authority;
2.? Get supply online;
3.??"Restructure,"?which he related to taking a  sagging company and figuring 
out a concerted approach?to fixing its  problems rather than?putting out fire 
after fire.? 
?
He believes the generators should relieve some of the  debt.
?
He was asked if?an Edison bankruptcy?would be a bad  thing.??He said 
it?"can't be good," but prefers to?think  of?Edison's status as a 
consideration to the overall approach but not  necessarily as the ultimate 
goal.? He indicated that bankruptcy is not  favorable but should not 
necessarily be avoided at any  cost.

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Gary, I just sent this to your other e-mail address.  The Lt Gov. was in on
this San Diego employee thing at the Dunn hearings, so this may come up.
The credibility of these former SDG&E employees was very weak in the
hearing and their allegations are absurd.....
________________________________________________________________________

To California news media covering electricity crisis:

As a result of the false claims by three former San Diego Gas & Electric
employees we have been in the news a bit lately. To add a bit of clarity to
the situation I am sending you our release issued Friday that goes through
each of the three claims and our response.

To more fully understand the situation, please read the attached story that
appeared in the LA Times yesterday. These reporters had the logs that were
stolen from our South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista more than two weeks
ago.  We went through these log books line by line with these reporters.
They also obtained confidential information from the Cal-ISO during these
three days (January 16-18) that indicated that we were operating at their
instruction when ramping up an down the units.  This is because the ISO
purchased the ability to move the units up and down to help ensure the
state's supply and demand is in balance.  This is a common practice and
done every hour of every day by the ISO at plants that are able to provide
this service.

Its unfortunate that we were not allowed to respond to these charges when
they were made formally in Senator Dunn's  committee hearing Friday
(although the information was leaked way before the hearing by someone).  I
understand that Governor Gray Davis is meeting with these former SDG&E
employees tomorrow.  We had tried to personally meet with the governor last
summer to offer very inexpensive long term power contracts and 2000
megawatts of peaking plants in 2001 and 2002 and were not able to.

   TIMES STAFF WRITERS


SACRAMENTO -- Three former San Diego power plant workers on Friday accused
officials of Duke Energy Co. of manipulating California's crippled
electricity market for higher profits, but records and interviews show that
the company was responding partly to state instructions.


Their testimony caused a sensation among power industry critics and brought
a sharp response from the company at the center of the whistle-blower
allegations, which called them "baseless."


The former employees at Duke's South Bay facility told a legislative
committee investigating alleged price gouging that the plant was ramped up
and down "like a yo-yo" in an apparent gambit to drive up profits.


In support of the allegations, the workers produced logs showing Duke's
trading arm constantly increasing and decreasing generation during power
emergencies over three days in mid-January.


Duke officials, who will testify in the weeks ahead, said the up and down
throttling of the plant came at the direction of the state, which had paid
the company to hold the disputed generation capacity in reserve.


Public records gathered in recent weeks by The Times confirm that at least
part of that activity was directed by the California Independent System
Operator.


Moreover, Cal-ISO, which in the past has accused power firms of withholding
electricity to boost prices, stressed Friday that it regularly directs
generators to adjust output to keep the grid humming.


"On a daily basis we have reserves that are set aside," Cal-ISO spokesman
Gregg Fishman said. "It's energy that can be called upon instantly to meet
a fluctuation in demand, or within 10 minutes, or within an hour.
Certainly, we call on [standby] services regularly to meet these
fluctuations."


The three witnesses who testified each had worked at the plant for more
than 20 years, first for San Diego Gas & Electric and later, under
contract, for Duke. They were let go by Duke in April.


Former power plant mechanics Ed G. Edwards Jr. and Glenn D. Johnson accused
Duke of throwing away valuable plant parts and of manipulating generation
capacity beginning in 1999, leaving workers puzzled.


Managers brushed aside questions about the activity, saying they were "for
economic" reasons, the workers said.


"Sometimes a unit would be down 'for economics' for two or three days.
Sometimes, it would be down for two or three hours. It didn't make sense,"
Johnson said.


He said the phrase appeared to be "another way to explain limiting the load
or curtailing the load to boost prices."


"Instead of running two units to make the same price," Johnson said, "you
could run one unit and make three times the price." Some energy experts
argue that it is possible to increase earnings by trimming power supply in
California's tight electricity market.


The third worker, Jimmy Olkjer, an assistant control room operator, said
such actions began after Duke began operating the plant.


Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the committee chairman, asked Olkjer whether
SDG&E operated in the same manner. "No," he said.


Edwards, one of the ex-mechanics, said prolonged repairs by Duke were part
of the apparent gaming of the power market.


Once, he was directed to throw away 23 pallets of power plant parts, he
said. "Some of it was brand new stuff" in its original packaging. "I used a
forklift, took them to a dumpster and dumped the pallets," Edwards said.


He testified that often it took weeks to find a needed spare part, which in
the past would have been readily available.


Duke officials bragged about their money-making ways, Edwards said. At
employee parties after the first year of operation, Duke executives boasted
that "they made more money than they had expected in five years."


Dunn and Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), a committee member, said
later that they were impressed with the credibility of the workers'
testimony, but that it did not constitute a "smoking gun." Both said they
would form no conclusion until hearing from Duke and other generators.


Duke officials, who will testify before the committee next month, said
Cal-ISO controlled much of the ramping activity. "Our employees followed
the directions" of the grid operator, said Bill Hall, who oversees Duke's
plant operations in the West.


Old or unnecessary parts were discarded as part of an upgrading of the
plant's inventory system, said Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman. Duke has
decreased outages and significantly increased its production since
purchasing the plant, he said. "The proof's in the numbers," he said.


One plant mechanic has told The Times that he was told to toss parts by the
previous owner, SDG&E, as well as by Duke.


Cal-ISO officials declined to discuss specific contracts and activities
with Duke. But records show that the agency regularly buys reserve and
standby power at the plant. That electricity can be ordered on and off the
system to maintain balances crucial to the complex grid.


In the January period focused on at Friday's hearing, records show that
three of the four South Bay units were repeatedly called on to deliver
standby power. The fourth unit was shut for servicing.


On Jan. 17, for example, records show that the agency called on one unit to
increase output by 62 megawatts at 6 a.m. and reduce it by that same amount
two hours later. Then at noon, the agency ordered 71 more megawatts,
cutting it back to 20 at 3 p.m. By day's end, the agency had asked for an
additional 38 megawatts.


A second unit was instructed to add 50 or more megawatts four times on the
same day. A third unit was ramped up or down 12 times, bouncing from zero
to as high as 221 megawatts.


The records show only power that ISO actually needed. The agency refused to
disclose how much reserve power it had under contract with Duke that it had
not called on.


But after reviewing records for the mid-January period, Cal-ISO manager of
markets Brian Rahman said, "The most viable reason why any one unit would
not have been producing would have been for operating reserve."

                    DUKE ENERGY REFUTES FALSE CHARGES;
               PLANT OUTPUT WAS CONTROLLED BY CALIFORNIA ISO
June 22, 2001

SACRAMENTO ? Duke Energy today said the output of its South Bay power plant
in California was directed by the California Independent System Operator
(ISO) to track fluctuations in electricity demand, and the plant operated
at top reliability. The company strongly denied allegations by three former
plant employees that power output was reduced at Duke Energy's own
direction.

The workers making the allegations were employees of San Diego Gas &
Electric (SDG&E) who were not hired as part of the new operating team when
Duke Energy assumed full control of the South Bay power plant in April.

Bill Hall, vice president of Duke Energy's western operations, said, "These
allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of
misinformation disseminated by people who don't know the full story."

Hall reviewed the charges and the facts:

Charge: Output from South Bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices
during times when energy supplies were short.
The facts:
?    The units were operated under the direction of the California ISO to
meet system reliability       and Duke Energy's contractual commitments.
?    While the three ex-workers allude to log books from the plant control
room with notations      from Duke Energy Trading & Marketing (DETM), the
former SDG&E South Bay employees         apparently did not know that that
the ISO directs output through the DETM coordinator. Our     records of ISO
directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations.

Charge: The most expensive unit was run at South Bay to drive up ISO
prices.
The facts:
?    South Bay's 15-megawatt, jet-fueled unit was designed principally to
provide start-up power   to the station's steam units. This unit has been
made available to provide as much energy as   possible to California during
the state's energy crisis.
?    During the period in question, the jet-fueled unit was being operated
because the price of jet      fuel was substantially less than the cost of
natural gas. This resulted in lower marginal costs. ?   The 15-megawatt
unit was being run to provide electricity to cover Duke Energy's California
     contractual commitments. This electricity was not being bid into the
ISO market, so there     was no way it could have influenced ISO market
prices.

Charge: Inventory management (including "throwing out spare parts") at
South Bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs.
The facts:
?    At no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable
for service.
?    The inventory management practices at South Bay represent standard
industry practices.      Duke Energy purchased the entire inventory for
South Bay when we assumed operations for      the plant in 1998. We
retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of
inventory that was damaged or obsolete.
?    Duke Energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our
power plants operating   during California's energy crisis.

Duke Energy continues to deliver real solutions to the state's energy needs
and to operate its business with integrity.

Duke Energy will hold a media briefing immediately following the state
Senate hearing at approximately 4 p.m. (ET). Reporters not in Sacramento
can call-in at: 888/664-9965, passcode DUKE.

This Thursday I will be a guest along with our favorite Lt Gov on
California Capital Week.  I can't think of a worse time to have this,
since Bustamonte is the point man on fhe three witnesses that
participated in last Friday's public Senate Hearing on price
manipulation.  So feed me your advice.  I am trying to take the high
road, but I will warn you right now that if Bustamonte makes any of his
outrageous statements in front of me, I will boldly correct him in no
short order.

Attached on the Cheney Report came via INGAA.  For those in the DC office, I 
have already printed hard copies if you would like one in that form.  These 
documents appear to be summaries and background materials on the Cheney 
report plus comparisons with the House Democrat's plan released yesterday.

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Rick:
Eight new projects--of which some are significant in size-- have been added 
to the list of the hot deals for May 25th, 2001.  They--and their suggested 
action items--are as follows:

 Project  Originator  Description     
EBS:
 Advertising JV  Erik Simpson  EBS to provide risk management to media 
buyer   ($28 million)
 Raven   Jeff Donahue  Purchase assets of managed hosting company ($400 
million)
 Samsung DRAM Ken Wang  1 month financing of DRAM Inventory (5 million)

Suggested Action Item:  Communicate findings to Sue Nord and compile GA 
comments for RAC, if any.  Lisa Yoho is also informed given the very 
interesting structure of Samsung DRAM deal that is likely to be repeated with 
other seriously backwardated commodities.  
EWS/EGM
 Weirton   Tammy Mulroony  Rolled Steal forward purchase ($ 75 million)
 Timber      Sale of 100 MM asset at cost  ($100 million)
 DPR accelerated put Mike Beyer  Exercise Put and reinvest in coal related 
assets  ($11 million) 
Suggest Action Item:  Communicate findings to J. Steffes, and Lisa Yoho and 
compile GA comments for RAC, if any.

Finally, I am taking the liberty to contact Paul Kaufman to inform him of 
project PortMorrow which is the developing of 47 MW peaking facility in 
Oregon for PGE (originator Chuck Randall).  I shall follow up with him in 
case that there are any needed action item.  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

FYI, I've faxed PG&E's filing to Rick Shapiro.  If others don't have it and 
want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10 
pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20 
creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.  

The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was 
realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That 
arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy.

I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.  I gave him this 
statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1) 
"what is Enron's actual exposure?", 2) "what was Enron's opinion of Gov. 
Davis' speech last night?", and 3) "was this PG&E's only option?"  I did 
respond to one follow-up question, which was "what options were available 
months ago?"  My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2) 
allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the 
siting process for new supplies.

Subject: Response Statement to PG&E's Ch. 11 Filing

It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing.

Rick - 

Attached is the revised travel budget for all your cost centers.  I will send 
the travel budgets to each cost center owner with the budget sheets for 
outside services.

As you know we sent new budget sheets for Harry, Lisa and Sue and sent 
revised budget sheets for your cost center.  I spoke to Amanda Schultz with 
Corporate Accounting a few moments ago and somehow in the process we have 
added $4,000 to the overall budget.  The initial budget number for your cost 
center was 22,358,000.  The new budget number total for you, Harry, Lisa and 
Sue equals $22,362,000.  Amanda indicated that there should be no problem 
with using the $22,362,000 number.  Please advise if you want me to make any 
changes to bring the number down to $22,358,000 for the four cost centers.

Thanks,

Eric

Dear Mr Shapiro 

I'm e-mailing you at the suggestion of Paul Dawson in London. My colleague 
Ian Fletcher has discussed with Mark Schroeder and Paul the possibility of 
arranging a secondment to Enron from my current post at the UK Government's 
Department of Trade & Industry (DTI). 

I am hoping to arrange a suitable posting to start late September 2001 and to 
last around two years. I would optimally like to be based in or around Los 
Angeles (so that I can live with my wife who will be in LA for the next two 
years) but understand that for Enron San Francisco is likely to be the 
closest location with any openings.

I attach a copy of my CV which outlines my experience, skills and 
achievements to date. You will see that I have already established a 
successful and varied career in the public sector - most recently in the 
energy sector. At this point I am looking for an opportunity to acquire real 
commercial experience using the skills I've already proved, whilst building 
up new ones. 

My colleague Maureen Verrall +44 (0) 20 7215 8022 manages the DTI's 
secondment team and would be able to talk through the practical and financial 
details.

Would it be possible for us to have a phone conversation at some point in the 
next few days? My direct office number is +44 (0) 20 7215 0237 or I could 
call you if that would be more convenient.

Yours sincerely, 

Edward Barker

Dan - The President's Energy plan included the following specific 
recommendations specific to fuel cells:

The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of Energy 
to develop next-generation technology- Focus research and development efforts 
on integrating current programs regarding hydrogen, fuel cells, and 
distributed energy.

The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of the 
Treasury to work with Congress to develop legislation to provide for a 
temporary income tax credit available for the purchase of new hybrid or 
fuel-cell vehicles between 2002 and 2007.

The Administration remains committed to the DOT's fuel-cell-powered transit 
bus program, authored by TEA-21.  This program demonstrates the viability of 
fuel-cell power plants for transit bus applications.

I will update as this moves forward.

The Corporate Marketing team along with members of other BU's will be holding 
a mid year off-site on Aug 3. The objectives are to enhance their marketing 
knowledge, refine our strategy, learn more about the resources that exist 
within Enron, and discuss ways in which we can add greater value to the 
business.

Our off-site will be held at the Woodlands Conference Center, and I would 
like to invite you to speak to about (20 to 25 people) for a half an hour on 
Friday morning. I know you live close by, so I hope this won't be an 
inconvience. Since our department fosters entrepreneurial thinking and seeks 
to learn more about new initiatives within Enron, all would benefit from 
hearing from you specifically about the following: The objectives for 
government and regulatory affairs domestically; how California may have 
disrupted Enron's plans; key objectives that need to be achieved, the 
strategies you are employing; and the role that marketing can play (if any) 
in the process. 

Please let me know if you will be available to join us, and we can discuss 
specifics closer to the date. 

Best regards,
Dennis

Rick: IPPNY's new Executive Director, Gavin Donahue, has personally solicited 
each of IPPNY's Board members for a contribution to IPPNY's PAC, which has a 
balance of $1,000. Donahue came to IPPNY last month from a very senior 
position in the Pataki administration (#2 person at the State Dept of 
Environmental Conservation and part of the Governor's inner circle), and can 
be extremely helpful to us as we pursue some project development 
opportunities in the State. I thought it was important to cultivate a 
relationship with Donahue and given that we have made similar contributions 
to IPPNY in prior years (most recently in 1997 or 98 I think), spoke to Steve 
Montovano about this request. Steve agreed that it made sense and could be 
funded out of the $5k budgeted for NY. Based on that conversation, I've 
already spoken to Donahue and indicated that we would contribute something. 
While I recognize that IPPNY is largely dominated by the generators, we do 
have some influence as a Board member and by virtue of just being Enron. I 
would not like to see us squander our "first impressions" with Donahue and 
undermine his new credibility as an organization head by denying him the 
funds to allow him to appear as a player in the political fund-raising 
circuit. Let me know if you're really uncomfortable with this approach. 
Howard

Elizabeth
 The budget allocation provided that 15% of our budget would go to Europe.  
On their behalf we have been heavily engaged on Trakya where arrearages have 
gotten as high as $150 million.  The strategy for countering this situation 
has been Washington based and two pronged - utilize the lenders, especially 
OPIC and EXIM which are both USG agencies, to drive an effort to call on the 
Turkish Treasury guarantee, and to mobilize the US government as a matter of 
policy and in the context of the IMF funding to insist that the Turks clean 
up their energy sector.  Both elements of the strategy have been recently 
successful with the consequence that about $60 million has been paid over the 
last several weeks.  I anticipate as the strategy plays out over the next 
month to six weeks we should see payments of an equivalent or greater 
amount.  Since my office has the relationship with OPIC and EXIM we have the 
lead across the government on this issue.  We also anticipate that there will 
be some work on the Spanish and Polish projects in the future. 
 In light of all of this perhaps we should increase Europe's allocation.  
Just a thought!  Thanks John

Linda:

Attached below is language for a national renewable energy credit trading 
program.  I've also attached talking points on the purpose, background and 
benefit of this program.  This program would be a big win for us, and I'm 
glad to assist you and your staff in any meetings to promote this program.  

After comparing the definition of renewable energy under title IX, Sect 981, 
it is nearly identical to the democratic draft.  Therefore, I don't have any 
changes to the definition at this point.

Regards,
Stacey

Rick,

Both CPUC draft decisions accept AReM's case -- 3 cent surcharge should NOT 
apply to DA.  Good for retail market. May be bad for UC/CSU case unless we 
keep them whole. By the way, I was the one who pushed AReM to get involved -- 
even though they hadn't been.  I got them to jump in a few days before 
testimony was due.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise 
the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory 
Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past 
re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on 
the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he 
could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of 
a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, 
nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the 
pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, 
see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at 
last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation 
who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.
---
In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in 
Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines 
and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the 
relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the 
access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, 
Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be 
arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could 
refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of 
transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the 
infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory 
authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would 
be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations 
and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch 
with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good 
general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when 
I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and 
balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, 
there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with 
september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

Subject: Phil Angelides Remarks


Phil Angelides addressed Town Hall Los Angeles last week about the energy
crisis.  Angelides was the first speaker in Town Hall's energy series.
Upcoming speakers include John Bryson, Steve Letbetter, Loretta Lynch, and
Ken Lay.

Angelides made the following comments regarding the energy crisis:

1.  A sharp downturn in California will send the national economy into a
slide
2.  California deregulation is a virus that will kill deregulation
nationally.
3.  The power shortage is a problem of our own making.
4.  Californians must conserve power in record-setting levels.
5.  The Governor and Legislator must level with citizens about the energy
crisis
6.  Utility rates must penalize consumption
7.  Californians must unite to reign in generators
8.  The Federal government should impose wholesale price caps
9.  If FERC will not fulfill its obligation to set fair and reasonable
prices, or the price of electricity
     increases 50% more, Californians must fend for themselves, possibly
through the formation of a
     buyers cartel with Oregon and Wash. or by seizing power plants.

Doug,

A former colleague who worked for me as a trainee when I was in the 
Commission always expressed to me an interest in working in the private 
sector. Indeed, at one time she was going to work at McKinseys in Moscow but 
(I think) turned it down because she always wanted to work in the West.  She 
is Estonian and speaks Russian, Finnish (?), French and German, and her 
English is perfect. Extremely bright though relatively young (I think she 
must be 25 ish, perhap older). Studied in France and elswhere. Currently in 
the Estonian Foreign M inistry in charge of Estonian accession negotiations 
(in which role I met her professionally too). If you were looking for someone 
to cover Central and Eastern Europe, I would recommend her for hard work, 
comprehension and ability to adapt, though no knowledge of energy per se. By 
far the best trainee I ever had.  So far all I have said is that I am at 
Enron, is she still looking?

 Dear Brendan,

It was lovely to hear from you and to realise that you have finally taken the 
leap into the private sector. I was just searching high and low for you a few 
weeks ago, because I was in Brussels for almost a week and was wondering if 
we might meet up for a cup of coffee. Especially as I had news to tell - all 
going well, I will be posted at our Embassy to Belgium and Luxembourg, 
starting January 2002! At the same time, I am still in principle also keeping 
an eye out for interesting private sector opportunities (and yes, Enron's 
record is most impressive.) What does the position entail more specifically? 
What would the requirements be? 

What would you do in my place? 

Best wishes,

Kadri

We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty=
=20
difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a=20
style we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I hav=
e=20
changed quite a few answers too.

Question1: In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen=
t=20
or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  W=
e=20
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to =
do=20
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness=20
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does =
an=20
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so=
rt=20
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi=
ng=20
EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter=
=20
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron=
=20
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any=20
transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being=20
conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal t=
o=20
all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on=
=20
the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  I=
n=20
addition, Enron=01,s risk management process is required to be approved by =
the=20
Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations =
as=20
a publicly held company.  Enron=01,s risk policies are provided in Enron=01=
,s=20
publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on =
a=20
quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk=
=20
management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron=
=20
trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies=
. =20
This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the=20
Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of=
=20
transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In=
=20
addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th=
ey=20
can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approve=
s=20
a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd=
ed=20
within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an=
=20
electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a=
re=20
not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty=01,s bid or offer vi=
a=20
EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma=
n=20
intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks=20
utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price=
=20
volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on=
=20
all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline doe=
s=20
provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or=
=20
breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is=
=20
sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha=
t=20
credit limit is still available.

EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters=
=20
into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on=
=20
EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General=20
Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for=
=20
each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreeme=
nt=20
is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater=
al=20
credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on=20
EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to=20
EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between=
=20
Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements=20
which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the=20
counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or=
=20
other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee=
n=20
the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing=
=20
the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.

Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect=
=20
data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,=
=20
does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL=20
collect, use or manage data regarding cookies?

It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's=
=20
mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no=
=20
capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20

EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20

Question 3: Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades=20
showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing=
=20
such data?  If yes, when?

There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da=
ta=20
from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline=
=20
(http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customer=
s=20
with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they=
=20
acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online chart=
s=20
for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices. =20
Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t=
he=20
results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows fo=
r=20
administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t=
o=20
monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with=20
their own systems.

Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron=
=20
will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market=20
activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For=
=20
example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas=
=20
Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian=20
Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will=20
commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes=20
available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price o=
f=20
that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent i=
n=20
this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.

Question 4:  In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron=20
Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?

EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups=20
depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that=
=20
handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling=20
Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back=
=20
office utilizing a =01&bridge=018:  a process that is capable of communicat=
ing=20
transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. Th=
e=20
potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the=
=20
customer with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office=
=20
systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various=20
functions, such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk=20
management and credit.  These back office systems are used to track=20
transactions from all sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other=
=20
trading systems, etc.  Information is maintained on these systems according=
=20
to accounting and regulatory rules, regardless of the source of the=20
transaction.

The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through=20
EnronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this=
=20
notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty=
,=20
the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi=
ed=20
by the system at the same time. =20

The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as=
=20
information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a=20
transaction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture syste=
m=20
that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system. =20
Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does,=
=20
however, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to=
=20
our settlement and credit systems.

Question 5: Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by=
=20
EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?

EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The=20
transactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases=
)=20
managing the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the=20
commodity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six year=
s=20
post a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this =
is=20
policy across all databases.

In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,=
=20
real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13=20
commodities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes=
=20
e-commerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that=20
previously took place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a=20

You were quite right on the topic of gas prices in California. I looked
through some articles I have been collecting that make reference to an
investigation by the FERC into alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp
in the context of the price basis between San Juan and Topock. You probably
know all this already, but I attach an article that was in the FT yesterday.

Sabine.

> Rosenfield is the Santa Monica-based consumer advocate who tried to halt
> California's experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started.
> His 1998 ballot measure failed, and that campaign is blamed in some
> circles for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to
> cause the electricity shortage that's helped send prices heavenward. 
> But if Rosenfield's last ballot initiative got the state's energy

> drive to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to
> authorize his $13 billion energy bond measure. 
> That bond, to be repaid by ratepayers, is supposed to reimburse the
> state's general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying
> for consumers since January, when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern
> California Edison ran out of money. The bond measure also will be used to

> And if it were up to him, he'd be willing to risk economic catastrophe to

> raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on
> the table. It is, he says, like giving crack to an addict. Take that money

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES

This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. America: The Good 
Neighbor.  

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable 
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television 
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as 
printed in the Congressional Record.

The comments at the end are not mine but I agree with them wholeheartedly.

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most 
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.  

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of 
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and 
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even 
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who 
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the 
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in 
to help.

This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody 
helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into 
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about 
the decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of those 
countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build 
its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal 
the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why 
don't they fly them?  Why do all the International lines except Russia fly 
American Planes? 

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the 
moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. 

You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once, 
but several times - and safely home again. 

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store 
window for everybody to look at.  Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued 
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are 
breaking Canadian laws, are getting America dollars from ma and pa at home to 
spend here. 

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through 
age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad 
and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both 
are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other 
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to 
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during 
the San Francisco earthquake. 

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired 
of hearing them get kicked around.

They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they 
are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their 
present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those. 

Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!"

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United 
States. It is nice that one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the 
world would realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never even 
get a thank you for the things we do. I would hope that each of you would 
send this to as many people as you can and  emphasize that they should send 
it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on 
the web. I am just a single American that has read this, I SURE HOPE THAT A 
LOT MORE READ IT SOON.

PLEASE FORWARD TO ANYONE APPROPRIATE:

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the 
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday 
afternoon.

He initially talked about "can bring a horse to water, but can't make him 
drink."  

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement 
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex + 
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside 
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of 
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.  

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in 
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c) 
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to 
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset 
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a) 
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are 
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar 
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market 
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these 
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to 
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under 
different assumptions.

Thanks,

Jim

Attached is a copy of the NYISO's just released decision regarding the 
appeals that had been taken concerning the Penalties and Public Disclosure 
proposals recently approved by the Management Committee (MC). In brief, the 
ISO Board agrees that such a proposal is desirable and should be put in place 
this summer, but finds fault with some of the provisions and omissions from 
the MC approved proposal. The Board directs its staff to begin to develop 
tariff provisions to implement a modified program to be filed with FERC as 
soon as possible after receipt from FERC of its decision on the proposed 
circuit breaker (now referred to as the automated mitigation procedures or 
AMP). Since a circuit breaker proposal will be voted on by the MC on May 23, 
even if passed and immediately filed with FERC, a decision regarding the 
circuit breaker is not likely to be forthcoming until July under even an 
expedited schedule. We will continue to work with other suppliers in opposing 
this program.

I would add to what Teun says below a good lesson from California for the 
Dutch: Disconnect the functioning of the retail and wholesale markets at your 
peril. If bad regulatory/ political  intervention gets in the way of 
participation by new and old players in both on a level playing field, 
fingers will get burnt. In the Netherlands the incumbent generators and 
vertically integrated distributors have been given unfair advantages in a 
non-transparent manner in the wholesale market, whilst enjoying more or less 
guaranteed prices in the retail market. New entrants/ importers got squeezed 
and most consumers have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of liberalisation. 
Incidentally, in both California and the Netherlands there was excessive 
political trumpeting of the benefits and of the enlightenment of policymakers 
in advance, followed by a mess in practice.

Peter, Nailia,

Today Dutch bank holiday, heard nevertheless your voicemail, please find 
below initial thoughts in bullet format:



Why California cannot happen in the Dutch market:

? Plenty installed capacity available 
Available import capacity about 30% of total demand
Price cap for distco's based on real quarterly purchase portfolio and 
industry average index 


Why California nevertheless -in the longer run- can happen:

? CHP plants are closed down and large generators are shutting down plants
Lack of grid system transparency with regards to importcapacity, operational 
aspects of the grid, balancing market etc. Biased signals to the market.  
Market structure with limited number of players therefore lack of 
competition. Prices do not reflect underlying market supply and demand ratio. 
Therefore new entrants are hesitating to add new assets to the market.
Environmental and spatial permits are time consuming processes. (e.g. 
National Government faces large resistance of local authorities against the 
siting of windmills). Governmental Policy aims at state of the art technology 
of new additions to the powerplantmix. Environmental Impact Report often 
necessary. 


Teun

Dear Linda,

 
I haven't been formally introduced to you, although I have seen you several 
times in the Houston offsites.  In the past 16 months, I have been working in 
Government and Regulatory Affairs group covering EBS global telecommunication 
issues.  Currently,  I am on secondment in London to help Jan Haizmann with 
European and Asian telecommunication licensing procedures. This September, I 
will be starting the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS) master program in Washington DC.  I have a strong interest in staying 
with the government affairs group and believe that a part time position in 
the Enron DC office will be complementary to my studies at SAIS. Rick Shapiro 
encouraged me to contact you directly, suggesting that you might be willing 
to meet with me and to help me identify the employment opportunities in the 
DC office.

It may be helpful for you to know that I have been working for the past two 
year for Enron. While in Houston, I had the chance to work on number of 
interesting projects, including providing financial modeling support for the 
former Enron International group.  I am familiar with deregulation process, 
especially with the recent developments in the telecommunication field.   In 
addition, working in the London office have provided me with the opportunity 
to working with the EU Commission, the UK Parliament and other lobbying 
groups.  I believe that my experience in Enron will enable me to play a 
proactive role in the DC office.   

I will be in touch with you by phone in a week.  Next month, I will be 
passing through DC & would like to set up a short 20-30 minute meeting with 
you at a mutually convenient time. 

I understand you are busy and appreciate your time. I look forward to talking 
with you soon.

Sincerely,

Attached are draft Q&A on Enron's response to the Greenpeace letter on 
climate change.   This document should be for close distribution to those of 
us in Enron Corp and Enron Europe who could potentially get questions on our 
response.  More general taking points for use by employees will be developed 
for distribution to a wider internal audience.

I would suggest that any detailed questions be referred to me so that we are 
able to closely control the messages consistent with our Corporate 
statement/strategy on climate.  If questions specific to Enron Europe come 
up, they should be referred to PR (Jackie/Kate) in London or Peter Styles in 
Brussels, who will coordinate closely with me.

Please review this document and make suggested changes and additions as soon 
as possible, as the letter has already been sent to Greenpeace (signed by 
Kelly and Mike on 4/30).

Thanks!

investors, but they're unsure whether to buy shares of a bond  mutual
fund or individual bonds. We weigh the merits of both.

FYI,  I am attaching for your information the price curves given to EES from 
ENA.  You will note that there is a very significant increase (approximately 
60% in some cases) between April 18 and April 25.  No reason has been 
attributed to the increase that any of the EES people I have talked to know 
about.  Speculation is that it is due to our inability to do physical deals 
(load following and balancing).  I believe that is probably the cause along 
with rising into Cinergy prices.  This is what precipitated my memo about the 
power swaps.  I got a green light from both EES and ENA to proceed and am 
waiting to hear back from AEP if they are willing to meet.

The issue of finding a solution to balancing and load following has to be the 
number one agenda item for the midwest because it is destroying our ability 
to do deals anywhere.  Mike Roan and I are working on a strategy to address 
the issue through the RTO on a longterm basis.  My hope is that negotiations 
with individual receptive utilities can provide interim solutions for us.

Janine

Masha, 

I hope the meetings in DC went well.  As we briefly discussed, I am a member 
of the EIM team here in Europe.  Although the group size is up to about 30 
now, we are still trying to develop the infrastructure, including those who 
deal specifically with regulatory requirements.  Consequently, I have been 
referred to you.  However, if there is someone else with whom I should speak, 
please let me know and I will be happy to do so.

Given that you and Lisa are probably the best suited to help us, I will 
outline for you what information/ analysis we are looking to find.  
Basically, we would greatly appreciate a similar profile/ excel sheets on 
anti-dumping, country profiles and countervailing and antidumping targets 
(country and producers) that you provided for the US team (see attached)


 - margins.xls, Anti dumping into Europe   - STEEL PROFILES.doc    - 
Hot-Rolled Memo.doc


We would be looking at these components as they relate to Europe 
(particularly the EU 15).  However, as major trade flows are intra EU 15 
south to north (particular focus on Spain, Italy, Germany, France and UK) AND 
other Europe and CIS to EU 15 and the rest of the world, the relationship of 
nations such as Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, etc. are  very important.

As we try to piece together and execute a strategy for steel transactions in 
Europe, any insight your team can provide would be greatly appreciated.  
Please feel free to give me a call and we can discuss this in greater 
detail.  Thank you in advance for your help.

Kind Regards,

To EPSA's Public Affairs & State Issues Committees:

During our steering committee call this morning on the Powerful Future Media 
Campaign, the group reinforced a desire to move forward expeditiously with 
production of our campaign, while at the same time reaching out to other 
potential stakeholders to join us in some paid media education/advocacy 
regarding the lessons from California.

The group is currently reviewing some initial drafts, and it appears likely 
that we'll be able to take advantage of some already booked studio time next 
Tuesday.

It also was agreed that we shift our approach somewhat - away from targeted 
states and toward targeted markets, supplemented by some placements in 
national regulator/legislator publications to help us cover the loss of a few 
state capitals.

Although, the actual markets and their priority will be determined by the 
"phase two" funders and their available resources, the plan envisions 
placements in east coast markets from at least Boston through Washington, 
D.C., as well Seattle and Portland in the West.  Other markets could also be 
included as we go.  At this point, the group decided against any California 
placements.  The total estimated budget for these buys is similar to that 
previously distributed.

Still plenty of room on the bandwagon, so please give me a call if I can be 
of further assistance, (202) 628-8200, ext. 103.

Regards,
Mark S.

Executive Summary
? New Extraordinary session opened today
? Forbearance period extended for SoCal
? QFs placing liens on SoCal, moving them closer to bankruptcy
? MOU is dead.  Nation's Plan B, an alternative to the MOU, will become a 
bill tomorrow and is gaining interest from both sides of the House.  SoCal 
and Davis has yet to give their support.

New Extraordinary Session
Yesterday, the Senate and Assembly passed resolutions to close the 
Extraordinary Session.  All bills from the 1st session be introduced into the 
2nd session as they were last amended, with the same bill number.  

Forbearance Period Extended
Regarding the forbearance extended to SoCal by banker creditors, the parent 
company's credit has been extended until 30 June.  The utility's forbearance 
is until 15 September.

QFs Placing Liens on SoCal's Assets
The QFs are placing liens against SoCal's assets (property or freezing its 
bank assets).  As a result, SoCal is moving ever closer to bankruptcy, maybe 
as early as later next week.  These actions on behalf of the QFs are added 
incentives for the legislature to move quickly on an alternative to the MOU.

Alternative Plan to the MOU
The MOU for SoCal is essentially deal.  There are a number of alternative 
plans being proposed.  The legislature held meetings last night on Democratic 
Assemblyman Nation's Plan B alternative to the MOU.  This plan is gaining 
momentum.  According to sources, Republican Assembly leader Cox has signed 
off for people to work on the plan implying Republican interest.  Senator 
Burton's office also reported work on the same Plan B.  Governor Davis' 
office is aware of the plan but has yet to comment.  There is also no word at 
this time as to whether the Republican Senate leadership is in support of 
Nation's Plan B.

Key details of the Nation plan include a $1.2 billion option for the state to 
purchase SoCal's transmission assets.  This money would be given to SoCal by 
the state regardless of whether the option was exercised, a detail likely to 
be unpopular with voters.  The remainder of the undercollect, stated as $3.5 
billion or an amount determined by PUC review, would be paid through 
securitization of the undercollect by SoCal.  Moreover, the utility would 
sell the state additional power at a cost beyond the 10 years already agreed 
upon in the memorandum-of-understanding and additional power from other 
company sources.   Sources report that the Nation plan also currently calls 
for generators to take a 30% haircut. 

The Nation Plan B will likely be introduced as a bill tomorrow and will 
likely go through start the legislative process by early next week.  The next 
scheduled floor session is Thursday; we should be able to tell how fast the 
legislature intends to move the bill.  There is no indication whether SoCal 
Edison would agree to the Nation plan.  Sources believe it is likely that 
SoCal would object to at least some of the plan's provisions (for example, a 
PUC audit of SoCal's debt amount to determine the direct rate component to 
pay for the undercollect).  SoCal is very much at odds with the PUC and 
wishes them to play as little role as possible.  If SoCal does ultimately 
agree to the plan, the state reportedly may offer a similar deal to PG&E.

Subject: Re: Renunciando a ABRACEEL  

Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  

Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.

When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.

But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the "policy makers" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  

In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 

Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out 
so that you can provide assistance from the USA.

Thank you for your perseverance on this long fight.

Jose

Attached are the somewhat revised comments we plan to file tomorrow with the 
FERC in the docket revisiting the pipeline marketing affiliate rules.  Unlike 
some other parties, who have taken this opportunity to file very detailed 
comments, we are holding back at this point for several reasons.  This is 
very early on in the process, if the FERC decides more is needed, a NOI or 
NOPR will come out and we will have a lot more opportunity to address 
specific issues.  There is also a chance that the change of guard at FERC 
will kill this whole effort, or at least take in a different direction.   
Finally, we will participate at the conference on 1/31 and can respond the 
the issues and questions there. So look at this attachment and let me know 
what you think.  And Becky, can you add the certificate of service - it only 
needs to go to the Secretary.

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES 
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials "agent" when buying an 
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial 
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the 
"Impower" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for 
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). 

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings 
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they 
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron 
generally has to also file for "EWG" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to 
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business 
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not 
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

 
Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). 

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

Signs of Abuse Seen by Judge in Gas Case


By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

Internal documents submitted as evidence that the El Paso
Corporation artificially inflated natural gas prices in California
suggest that the company did indeed intend to manipulate prices.

Rick: 
This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and 
short talks with the various colleagues in India Team.  I do have a meeting 
with Wade tomorrow (June 13th) to understand his requests of support from 
GA.  While I do not expect much,  I shall communicate to Wade the standing 
policy of GA, namely, "GA shall provide the required support".  
Notwithstanding this mandate, I shall communicate it in a manner to give 
Houston the final say.   

In the context of regulatory support, there two important areas for GA 
contribution; they are: a) Dealing with the regulatory commission (MERC), and 
b) third party sales.  It is likely that India shall need a week per month, 
most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay.  
The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA, and exit 
India (but see point 5 below).  It is the understanding that there are teams 
in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation 
to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract (MSEB has to agree on the 
valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process).  It is 
noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market 
basis, but rather on accounting basis.  
As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely 
route (around 60%), renegotiation is not discussed much (hastily added 
however, renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated 
in Singapore the other day in the lenders' meeting; they also want ENRON to 
complete phase II which we are refusing).  
If renegotiation is to take place, its crux will be the reduction in energy 
and capacity costs to both phases and finding off-taker to Phase II (1400 MW 
kit and caboodle).  NTPC, or PTC are the likely parties to assume such 
responsibility.  Of course, we are trying to avoid any commercial risks 
associated with marketing this power.  Whether we accept it or not, every 
issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and 
solved.  
The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest 
level; that is directly from RMcDonald, and JS.  The fact that both of them 
did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned 
as a minus point.  Perhaps this point should be communicated to them.


As mentioned above, GA contribution could be in two areas, namely dealing the 
regulatory commission (MERC), and third party sales.  Starting with the 
later, third party sales, it is perhaps the most important point in the 
renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment 
(incidentally, Enron's commitment in the project is between $0.65 and $0.825 
billion--with B--depending on what to include and exclude).  Ironing the 
issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of 
renegotiation, but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there 
is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added.  As for 
dealing with MERC,  it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to 
expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you 
have any questions and/or advise.

Best regards


AI

Sue --

Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the 
Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt.  
Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed 
with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than 
Friday, August 17th.  I will be preparing a report for your use noting the 
final ratings of your Exempt employees from the PRC meetings and distribute 
that within the next week.

For your Non-Exempt employees, I have listed below all eligible employees for 
whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation.  However, I need the 
rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP system.  The 
descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as:

1 - Consistently performs above expectations
2 - Meets expectations
3 - Does not meet expectations

Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees below and 
return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.

Here's a summary:

? WGU focuses on "competency-based education"--apparently it gives credit for 
job experience, etc.  
? Degrees offered include:  AS, BS, MS in Learning and Technology, Graduate 
Certificates in Technology and Instructional Design, and an Undergraduate 
Certificate.  Focus is teaching and information technology.
? They appear to offer course-work as an employee-benefit and the potential 
to earn a college degree through "distance learning"--like University of 
Phoenix.
? On 11.27.00, WGU received "Candidate For Accreditation" status by the 
Inter-Regional Accrediting Committee (IRAC).  
? WGU partners with AT&T, Cisco Systems, Novell, Sun Microsystems, and 3Com.
? WGU has a "National Advisory Board," which aids WGU in planning and 
implementation.  The NAB consists of AOL, Apple, AT&T, Cisco Systems, 
Convergys, Drake International, IBM, ITP, KPMG Consulting, Micron, Microsoft, 
Novell, SallieMae, SCT, Sun Microsystems, and 3Com
? Participating States include all the WGA States:  the 12 Western states, 
Guam, Indiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas.
? Board of Trustees includes: the Chairman of 3Com, a VP of Sun, President 
Northern Arizona University, Representative from the Alfred P. Sloan 
Foundation, VP Gov't Affairs for AT&T, Nebraska Coordinating Commission on 
Higher Education, Roy Romer, General Manager of Global Education Industry for 
IBM, and Governor's Geringer, Knowles, Locke, and Leavitt.
? Governor Leavitt is Co-Chair with Governor Locke.

		 Subject: Ken Lay/John Lavorato Briefing Material

 I have attached the following: a) a high level outline of the speaking 
points for Ken Lay and John Lavorato for their meetings with Premier Harris 
and, I hope, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert;  and  b) a more detailed briefing 
note which outlines:   i) key developments since April 4 ,   ii) our position 
re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening 
the market this Fall, iii) differences between California and Ontario; and 
iv) Enron's assessment of the possible difficulties in NYC this Summer.  I am 
awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on 
NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the 
detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position 
in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of 
pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that 
piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured 
in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key 
issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I 
have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 
       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of 
the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et 
al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall 
if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide 
Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly 
New York and California) about which the government may have continuing 
concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward 
to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left 
me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit 
and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is 
evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing 
material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any 
changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken 
Lay.                                 I would appreciate your questions, 
comments and suggested revisions.

Rick - 

based on our meeting last week and budget savings information received so far 
attached is the revised headcount information for your review and comment

I have budget savings information from everyone except Jean Ryall and hope to 
get that information tonight; once I have all the numbers I'll send something 
to you

I hope to meet with Sue Nord today to talk to her about the cost savings for 
EBS G/A to make sure I understand what numbers she is offering


also - I asked Ginger to put me on your calendar for Friday afternoon 
(4:30-5:00) to go over headcount, travel policy, phone policy, budget 
savings, etc.; would you like me to work on the Europe, Asia and Australia 
budgets since those are now under your control; if so, are we looking for 
savings opportunities there as well

Thanks,

Eric

Some interesting feedback on Enron's entry into the steel market.   Hope 
you're enjoying your vacation.

		 Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, "Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had "sold material 
to Enron" and that "Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency."  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. "What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a "spot" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: "The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments."
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: "Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a "break even" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd)."
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: "I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the "Hunts of the steel business" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year."(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: "Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market."
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a "spot" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

Rick, Schnichels is positive, but has concern about timing (not now, but in 6 
months) and also, exactly what would he do? I said that we could arrange for 
him to meet the right people, but the ball is in his court for the moment; he 
wants to speak to his wife. Definately wants to moe to Frankfurt. Brendan

Rick - below are Harry's proposed budget savings; let me know if you need any 
additional information; I plan to go back and revise the individual budget 
sheets and once we get to an appropriate number I can have the overall budget 
numbers reduced with accounting; I'm not sure if you were planning to give 
money back now or later; let me know; thanks and have a good trip - Eric

Eric - my budget suggestion is this - I had RCR money for $350,000 related to 
Illinois (Com Ed) case.  I suggest cutting this back to $150,000 for now, for 
a savings of $200,000 of budget money.

I didn't have any other specifics.  Thanks.

COLORADO -- Gov. Owens OKs 'no-call' list

Gov. Bill Owens (R.) yesterday signed legislation allowing
citizens to place their names on a "no-call" list if they don't
want to receive telemarketing calls.  Telemarketers can't contact
persons on the list unless they have an established business
relationship with them.  Violators of HB 1405 will be guilty of a
deceptive trade practice.

The Public Utilities Commission must contract by Jan. 1, 2002,
with an agent to maintain the Web site and database containing
the no-call list.  By July 1, 2002, the agent must develop the
no-call database.  The PUC must promulgate rules by April 1,
2002, to administer the database.

______________________________________________________

SOUTH CAROLINA -- Wireless carriers not required to contribute to
state USF

The Public Service Commission yesterday decided to exclude
wireless revenue from its universal service fund (USF).  State
law requires all telecom service providers to contribute to the
USF, but the law defines telecom services as "nonwireline
services provided in competition to landline service."

Verizon Wireless, Inc., and the PSC staff asked the PSC not to
require wireless companies to contribute to the USF.  There isn't
"sufficient evidence" that any wireless company competes with any
local service provider in South Carolina, the PSC said.  (Docket
no. 97-239-C)

______________________________________________________

GEORGIA -- BellSouth amends SGAT

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., has filed a revised statement
of generally available terms and conditions (SGAT) for
interconnection, unbundled network elements, and resale services.
The revised SGAT implements recent Public Service Commission and
FCC decisions.

The SGAT includes several revisions that, among other things:
(1) clarify that BellSouth won't pay reciprocal compensation for
"fraudulent" traffic; (2) add forecasting requirements; (3)
expand requirements for notice, discontinuance of service, and
deposits; and (4) update service provider number portability
implementation procedures.  (Docket nos. 6863-U, 7253-U and
10692-U)

______________________________________________________

KANSAS -- KCC to review SW Bell proposed access cuts

The Corporation Commission has scheduled a June 27 hearing on
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s proposal to reduce its
intrastate switched-access rate from about 5- to 1.2-cents a
minute.  (5/18/01)  SW Bell made the proposal as part of an
agreement among the commission staff, United Telephone Companies
of Kansas, d/b/a Sprint, Sprint Communications Co. LP, and AT&T
Corp.

AT&T and Sprint agreed to pass through SW Bell's access charge
reductions to customers.  Sprint estimated that its average
residential per-minute rates would decrease 15% to 22%.  AT&T
said its "leading consumer" residential rates would decrease by
nearly 30%.

If approved, SW Bell's switched-access rate reduction would take
effect Oct. 1 and would cost the company $25-$28 million in
annual access revenue.  The revenue reduction would be offset by
increases in rates for residential and business access lines.
Rates for basic local business service would increase to a range
of $22.25 - $33.80 per month.  Rates for local business service
with optional expanded area calling service would increase to
$41.25 per month from the current rate of $36.25 per month, the
commission said.  (Docket no. 01-GIMT-082-GIT)

______________________________________________________

VERMONT -- Commissioner Burke to begin first full term

The state Senate has confirmed the reappointment of John Burke as
commissioner to the Public Service Board.  He had been serving
the remainder of retired Commissioner Suzanne Rude's term since
December 2000.

______________________________________________________

MICHIGAN -- House OKs number-conservation measure

The House has approved a resolution urging the FCC to approve the
Public Service Commission's request for additional number-
conservation authority.  According to HR 81, many of Michigan's
area codes are exhausting quickly because of "the lack of
efficient number distribution and the lack of FCC approval for
the PSC to institute [1,000-number block pooling]."

______________________________________________________

CONNECTICUT -- OCC says AT&T has had enough time to expand
network

The Office of Consumer Council (OCC) has asked the Department of
Public Utility Control to reject AT&T Corp.'s requested cable TV
franchise agreement extensions.  The OCC filed a motion to strike
AT&T's application that would give the company more time to
expand its Lakeville system network.  AT&T hasn't completed yet
the number of network miles required by the agreement.

The DPUC has granted a franchise term extension and instituted a
hearing to review and consider AT&T's request to modify a
franchise agreement in Vernon.  The OCC recommended revoking the
extension and objected to technical meetings.  The DPUC has ruled
that "further review and consideration of AT&T's request for
additional time to complete the system upgrade is in the public
interest."

______________________________________________________

NORTH CAROLINA -- @ Communications asks UC to arbitrate
interconnect pact

@ Communications, Inc., a data competitive local exchange
carrier, has asked the Utilities Commission to arbitrate an
interconnection agreement it's negotiating with Carolina
Telephone and Telegraph Co., d/b/a Sprint.  @ Communications
objects to Sprint's requirement that it compensate Sprint for
transporting traffic outside of Sprint's local calling areas if
the company designates one point-of-interconnection (POI) per
LATA (local access and transport area).  Sprint prefers that
CLECs designate one POI per calling area, Sprint said.

Even if it bears some responsibility for transport costs, it
should be limited to the company's percentage of originating
minutes, @ Communications said.  It said Sprint's requirement
that @ Communications "bear 100% cost responsibility regardless
of the direction of the traffic" violates the FCC's
interconnection rules.  (Docket nos. P-7, sub 969; P-10, sub 611

______________________________________________________

ILLINOIS -- ICC extends Ameritech 'alt-reg' proceeding

The Commerce Commission yesterday extended the comment schedule
on a hearing examiner's proposal rejecting a proposed rate cut
for Ameritech-Illinois.  (5/24/01)  Briefs on exception now are
due June 13, and reply briefs on exception are due June 25.
Briefs originally were due June 6, and replies were due June 13.

The proposed order addresses renewing Ameritech's alternative-
regulation plan.  (Docket nos. 98-0252, 98-0335, 00-0764)

______________________________________________________

ILLINOIS -- Essex asks ICC to settle interconnect dispute

Essex Telecom, Inc., has asked the Commerce Commission to settle
a dispute the company is having with Gallatin River
Communications LLC over implementing their interconnection
agreement.  According to Essex, Gallatin wants Essex to bear the
entire cost of the originating switching and transport within and
from each Gallatin local calling area to the interconnection
point (IP).

Essex has selected the Gallatin tandem in Dixon as its IP in the
LATA (local access and transport area).  Essex has established
collocation with Gallatin in Dixon.  The Essex switch is in
Sterling.

Essex says it wants to serve some customers "though what Gallatin
describes as 'virtual NXX service.'"  Essex, however, says it
provides service between the customer's physical location and the
NXX on its network.

According to Essex, "Gallatin takes the position that Essex must
compensate Gallatin for calls originated by Gallatin's customers,
routed over Gallatin's network, delivered to Essex at the IP and
then transported and terminated from the Dixon IP to the Sterling
POP to any user not physically located in the same NXX rate
center as the calling party."

Essex says Gallatin demands that it (1) have its customers pay
Gallatin for a business line between Dixon and Sterling, (2)
resell Gallatin's business line service to its customers, or (3)
pay exchange access to Gallatin before it will exchange such
traffic.  (Docket no. 01-0427 - Complaint and Request for Dispute
Resolution of Essex Telecom, Inc., Against Gallatin River
Communications LLC)

______________________________________________________

FLORIDA -- Sprint wants Verizon to resell features on 'stand-
alone' basis

Sprint Communications Co. LP has asked the Public Service
Commission to require Verizon Florida, Inc., to resell its
features on a stand-alone basis.  Verizon won't resell its
features at wholesale rates unless they are packaged with
Verizon's local dial-tone service, Sprint said.

Verizon's refusal to resell its features on a stand-alone basis
prevents Sprint from offering Internet call waiting or forwarding
to a wireless phone, "follow me" service, and "competitive"
voice-mail service, Sprint said in a petition asking the
commission to arbitrate renewal of its interconnection agreement
with Verizon.

______________________________________________________

CONNECTICUT -- '711' to be operational by mid July

The Department of Public Utility Control has set a July 16
implementation date for access to the state's telecommunications
relay service (TRS) using the abbreviated dialing code "711."
Currently, the state's TRS is accessed using an "800" number.
(5/18/99)

Because a majority of carriers support the "implementation of
education and outreach programs," the Department also has
required all carriers to develop and submit a 711 education and
outreach program jointly.  (Docket no. 99-05-15, DPUC
Investigation into the Use of 711 dialing to Access
Telecommunications Relay Service network)

______________________________________________________

MAINE -- Report extends area code's projected exhaust

The projected exhaust date for the "207" area code has been
lengthened by three years, according to a recent report by the
North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA).  The area
code, now projected to exhaust during third quarter 2005, was
delayed by the implementation of 1,000-number block pooling in
June 2000.  "Given that three years ago, the [NANPA] told us that
a new area code would be needed by June of 2000, we believe our
efforts have been well spent," said Public Utilities Commission
Chairman Thomas Welch.

______________________________________________________

MICHIGAN -- '269' to be new area code for '616' 'split'

The Public Service Commission has announced that "269" has been
assigned as the new area code for the portion being "split" from
the "616" area code.  The PSC order the split to relieve number
exhaustion in 616 earlier this week.  (6/6/01)

A north/south geographic split will be implemented with a
dividing line that follows the northern boundaries of Saugatuck,
Hamilton, Hopkins, Wayland, Middleville, Hastings, and Woodland
rate centers.  Customers in and to the south of these rate
centers will receive a new area code.  Customers to the north of
the rate centers will retain 616.

Permissive dialing will begin by July 13, 2002, and mandatory
dialing will begin Feb. 15, 2003.  Wireless carriers will have an
extended permissive dialing period through Feb. 15, 2004.  (Case
no. U-12850)

______________________________________________________

COLORADO -- ICG to withdraw from residential market

Bankrupt competitive local exchange carrier ICG Communications,
Inc., has informed the Public Utilities Commission that it plans
to withdraw from the residential local exchange service market.

The PUC will consider the application during its June 27 regular
meeting, a PUC spokeswoman told TR.  She said that ICG hasn't
disclosed to the PUC the number of Colorado residential customers
that it has.

______________________________________________________

ILLINOIS -- City mulls license for AT&T Wireless

Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley (D.) yesterday introduced an
ordinance that would authorize the Department of Aviation to
enter a license agreement with AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.
Under the agreement, AT&T would construct, install, operate, and
maintain radio-frequency transmission and reception systems at
O'Hare International and Midway airports.

______________________________________________________

KANSAS -- KCC wants more data on SW Bell OS proposal

The Corporation Commission has extended the deadline for
reviewing Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s application to
deregulate its operator and directory assistance services.  The
commission extended the deadline from May 21 to June 25.

The staff asked the commission provide more time to review SW
Bell's request.  "No service-specific data has been provided to
support [SW Bell's] claim of rampant competition for these
operator services," the staff said.  (Docket no. 01-SWBT-932-MIS)

______________________________________________________

NORTH CAROLINA -- Nextel transfers long distance customers to
ComTech21

The Utilities Commission has approved Nextel Long Distance's

A Company (who has not agreed to go on record, but Smutny knows who it is) 
has decided not to build two planned power plants in CA because of all the 
uncertainty and the threat of the windfall profits tax.  Instead (and I'm not 
making this up), the Company is sending the two turbines to Bulgaria!

Christi, Doug and Jean

Attached is Brad Jones' final version of the ERCOT Filing (the one labeled 
v.3).  I have also attached the copy that I sent Brad with my comments.  I 
think he did a pretty good job of incorporating my concerns. As I said on the 
reply to Thane I think we would be conspicuous in our absence from this 
filing if we don't sign on.  So far 11 entities have signaled there desire to 
sign on.  Does anybody know how many signed on to the first filing on this 
matter?  Christi, I have the instructions from Brad about where to fax the 
signature sheet - he needs it by 3:00 Friday.   What I am trying to do is to 
get the PUC Staff to understand that there is a fundamental difference 
between the way they (and us) are looking at an electricity market (ie with 
PJM glasses on) and the way that the market designers viewed things.  It has 
been clear throughout my discussions with them regarding congestion 
management that they don't understand the difference - not yet anyway, but 
they are getting better.  Once they do get a clearer picture of the 
differences they will better understand our arguments against balanced 
schedules.  With this in mind wherever possible I try to get John Meyer, Brad 
Jones, Barry Huddleston et al to articulate their philosophy more clearly - 
and the more they do that the greater our chances are.  Because, as Hogan so 
succinctly stated, their model doesn't work.  If it does...well...great.  
Anyway my recommendation is that we sign on.  Doug, although I would have 
written it differently,  I don't think the tone of the final version is 
overly critical or whining.

Please let me know what you think.  I won't be able to communicate much 
today...I'm presenting at a meeting on congestion management in SPP here in 
Dallas.

Regards, Ron

The CEO meetings on Thursday went very well, and we had great turnout.  
Attached is a final list of who Ken met with and a list of who we invited.  
The takeaway from both meetings was to draft a letter outlining our 
five-point solution proposal, and the CEOs would be willing to sign it and 
send to the governor and legislators.  Jeff and I drafted the letter and will 
finalize and send it to the CEOs on Monday.  I also think we ought to 
consider placing full-page ads with the letter and enlisting some of the CEOs 
to attend editorial boards.  At this point, it's important to keep Enron out 
of the picture.  We'll route the letter when it's finalized.  kd

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: April 6, 2001

RE: FERC Orders Issued April 6th (1) CalPX Chargebacks;
(2)CalPX  Rate Recalculations; and (3) Kern River
Certificate

We want to inform you of three significant orders FERC issued today, two 
relating to the California Power Exchange (CalPX), and the third concerning a 
pipeline project from Wyoming to California.

(1) Pacific Gas & Electric Company v. California Power Exchange Corporation, 
et al. (Docket Nos. EL01-29/33/36/37/43-000) "Order on Complaints Concerning 
Use of Chargebacks and Liquidation of Collateral"
In this order, the Commission addressed five complaints against the CalPx 
concerning its response to alleged defaults by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) 
and Southern California Edison Company (SoCal Edison).  Among other things, 
the Commission determined that "the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was 
not designed to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application 
in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable."  Accordingly, the 
Commission directed the CalPX to rescind all prior chargeback actions and 
refrain from any future chargeback actions relating to PG&E and SoCal 
Edison's liabilities, subject to further Commission action in accordance with 
the order.
Regarding the ultimate question of how the PX should account for the 
nonpayments by SoCal Edison and PG&E, the Commission deferred further action 
pending the outcome of SoCal Edison's State Court Complaint, as well as the 
Government Claims Board Complaint.  Finally, with respect to the PX's 
bankruptcy proceeding, the Commission concluded that section 362(b)(4) of the 
Bankruptcy Code allowed it to lawfully exercise its regulatory power under 
sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act, so long as it did not threaten 
the bankruptcy court's control over the property of the bankruptcy estate.

(2) San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary 
Services (Docket Nos. EL00-95-015/016 and Docket Nos. EL00-98-014/015) "Order 
Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting Compliance Filing, and Directing the 
Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates"
In this order, the Commission dismissed the CalPX's request for rehearing of 
the Commission's January 29, 2001 order, which found that the CalPX had 
violated the Commission's December 15, 2000 order and the Federal Power Act.  
The December 15 order required the CalPX to pay suppliers in the CalPX 
markets their as-bid price above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally, the 
Commission accepted the PX's compliance filing and provided guidance to the 
PX on an acceptable methodology so that the PX may implement the $150/MWh 
breakpoint for its January 1, 2001 invoices.  Additionally, as in the 
chargeback case, the Commission determined that its action in the instant 
case was exempt from the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

(3) Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Docket No. CP01-106-000) "Order 
Issuing Certificate"
Pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission denied the 
protests that had been filed and issued a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity to Kern River authorizing it to construct and operate its 
California Action Project, subject to resolution of the proceeding pending in 
Docket No. CP01-61-000.  However, the Commission rejected Kern River's 
proposal to utilize a return on equity for this project of 15.25 percent.  
Instead, the Commission directed Kern River to file a revised incremental 
rate to reflect a return on equity of 13.25 percent at least 30 days prior to 
commencing service.  Finally, the Commission conditioned the certificate on 
Kern River's compliance with the environmental conditions set forth in 
Appendix C to the order.

These orders can be found on the Bulk Power section of FERC's website, at 
www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm.  If you have any questions, comments 
or would like additional information relating to these orders, please contact 
either Julie Simon (jsimon@epsa.org) or Mark Bennett (mbennett@epsa.org) at 
(202) 628-8200.

Hey all. Here is a copy of the report that we provided to Dave Delainey 
yesterday.  We will be working with Jeff Ader in Delainey's group to review 
these opportunities and will most likely be coming back to you for further 
assistance once they have narrowed down which leads to pursue. 

Thanks to each of you on this e mail who provided input and assistance on 
this project--especially on such short notice. As you become aware of new 
situations or changes in regulatory or utility positions, please give either 
Dan Allegretti or me a call to discuss.

All--here's some thoughts on our work with the Governors going forward thru 
the next 3 to 6 months.  Although Paul and I have talked about picking 4 or 5 
specific issues or solutions to focus on, I am a bit concerned that we will 
not be able to get them to focus on more than 1 or 2.  We also have to give 
them some constituent cover, and the other overriding concern is that the 
Republicans will generally only support what Cheney/Bush support.  The 
Republican governors are clearly looking at the WGA as a vehicle to "cover" 
their interests as well as an entity to come up with a solution for new and 
improved transmission systems.  

Here's a few strategies we've been talking about in addition to what we're 
doing at the WGA transmission workshop meetings:


 1.  Convince the Governors that they need to send a strong message to all 
stakeholders that they expect RTO west to have met identified goals and 
guidelines by a certain date and be up and running by a date  beyond that.  
We would need to come up with that timeline in very short order, as the best 
shot we would have in getting those dates in the public domain on record 
would be thru the energy resolutions that will be passed at the WGA annual 
conference in August.  This would be a long shot because of all of the 
incumbent interests.  However, if we could get a VERY simple message on this 
goal we might have a shot.  


 2. Educate/mobilize the Governors to petition FERC to make sure that the 
refund settlement mania doesn't extend outside sales in California. Paul can 
talk about this a little more in depth tomorrow---my understanding is that 
Pacificorp is looking for that relief, but our argument would be that a 
bailout for them would in esssence punish all of the utilities that did right 
by their customers and planned well.  We could frame it as a shareholder vs 
consumer issue.  

 
 3.  Formalize a list of compatible items in both the Democrat and the 
Cheney/Bush plans and work to communicate those areas that could be agreed 
on.  I'm not sure how measurable the benefit to us would be in this 
endeavor---I think we would have to do tremendous PR in order for it to have 
any benefit to Bush and therefore the Republican Governors.  The individual 
benefits to Locke and Kitzhaber might be better relationships for us with 
their offices, but I'm not sure what else.



 And of course we would like the Governors to petition FERC to mandate open 
access--we're trying to set a time in late July for Steve Kean and Governor 
Geringer to meet.  Kean thinks Geringer might be a good messenger to FERC.

Subject: where does our energy come from?


Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

---------------------------------------------


***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)

It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to
identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high
profits
on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our
investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power
companies,
utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts
could
all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those
companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a
misrepresentation of fact.

FYI

May be I was too assertive in the press criticizing the stupidity of revoking 
Annex V and setting caps on spot.  Mr. Mauro Arce got upset, but he realized 
that his proposal to change the rules would face strong opposition, with 
solid arguments. 

In my simple view, he realized that not everyone would stay quiet.

Let's see.

Maurer,

Sorry, I forgot to copy you.
My opinion is that with this presentation and your  letter we are ready to go 
to Pedro Parente.

By the way:
Two non official news, but from reliable sources ( Assad and Fred) ;

NO CAP, MAE PRICE WILL BE 684 REAIS ( COST OF DEFICIT), announced by Mauro 
Arce
SUB-MARKET LIMITS BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE SAME USED BY ONS. No 
more Encargos de Servi?os do Sistema being artificially created ( this was a 
condition precedent in our/Abradee's proposal). Fred has the resolution draft.

Let's wait to see the measures published, and celebrate these to small 
victories latter. The big one is Anex V.

Attached document prepared by our guys ( Sergio, Fred, myself, and part of 
Abradee's team ) yesterday night in Brasilia and given to Mauro Arce today by 
Sergio Assad.
It is not perfect, but opportunity sometimes is gold.
Our idea (Orlando) is to go to Pedro Parente and present/discuss it with him.

After our discussion at lunch last Thursday, I think I need more advice from 
you on how to deal with the sort of intervention you can see below!! I tried 
really hard to cover all the bases on this initiative, nearly all face to 
face. Then Paul H didn't turn up at the staff meeting on Monday and I get the 
e-mailed questions you see below (when he could have come to chat to me about 
it.) I will of course try to smooth over things verbally with Paul, but if 
this is what happens when I "give up" 30% of the time of a direct report to 
benefit her career development and the company's biz. priorities, you will 
understand some frustration on my part at our current arrangements!!

Subject: Nailia's opportunity to work more on the trading floor  

I have made no formal request to HR for housing, Paul. As you know, I have 
agreed with Eric Shaw, Paul Mead, Paul Dawson and Alfredo Huertas that Nailia 
will spend c. 30% of her time in the next six months working on Italian reg. 
issues, and that to facilitate that role and to help her get better exposure 
to commercial teams on EU issues too, she will spend on average three days a 
week over that period on the trading floor, next to the Italian team. (We 
announced all of this in the staff meeting yesterday.)  

Her travel to London tends to be weekly already, and is done on a very 
reasonable Eurostar youth fare basis. I think the budget question then is 
simply: Is it more efficient for the company to pay for a hotel room two, 
three or four nights a week or to allow Nailia to take a cheap flat share? 
The latter may well work out better, especially taking into account the 
flexibility it will allow. I am told Tara Rozen has a suggestion. Let's see 
the comparison; then I agree the four of us should judge together. I'll keep 
you informed. Give me a call if you have any other concerns about any aspect 
of the arrangements.

Peter.

Peter

I understand from Sophie Kingsley that a request has been placed with her to 
secure housing for
Nailia in London for a few days each week for the next several months. I have 
discussed this with Doug and Paul.
We would like to discuss this with you to understand the thinking behind this 
as well as the expense. It seems reasonable
in these days of cost cutting that we make these decisions jointly. Thanks

Paul

Rick/Mark:

Thought you might want to see the concept board that SSK came up with.  
Please see note below, which SSK sent to a Constellation employee who 
couldn't attend the meeting last week.  
***************************************

lindy:

thanks for the input.

also, per your request from yesterday, attached please find a PDF file with 
the visual concept board that was presented at last friday's meeting.  again, 
as we discussed, this is NOT an ad, and it's not intended to be presented as 
an ad, despite the fact that it very much looks like an ad.  rather, it's an 
illustration of how the research-based strategic insights to this complex 
issue can be distilled down to a single-minded concept with an easy visual 
read.  as i mentioned yesterday, i am concerned that anyone who will view 
this ad out of context could misconstrue what it is and what its purpose is.

thanks again,

jonathan

Subject: WEST DESKS--FERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from
 industrials (and more)

On March 14, 01, FERC issued an "Order removing obstacles to increased 
electric generation and gas supply in the West.."  (Docket No. EL01-47).

 Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to 
licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 
12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer 
license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the 
industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES 
requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that 
request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and 
used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public 
utilities" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at 
wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated 
entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA 
(would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate 
schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and 
authorizations.
 -- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by 
state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce 
consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at 
market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An 
aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a 
manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load 
under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with 
contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of 
power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports 
would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with 
transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is 
wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  
FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are 
required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of 
incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service 
by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers "rolled in" rates for generation interconnection (rather than 
direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency 
standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a 
negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California 
and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching 
load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection 
requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) 
and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

Yes Rick asked me to look at it - and I will get back to everyone with more 
information.  From what I know at this point, there is a lot of confusion 
over the relationship between the new federal law and state efforts to enact 
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ('UETA"). (There are some very 
complex and unanswered preemption issues that remain).  I would not take UETA 
off of our state legislative agenda yet.

Subject: electronic signature legislation

Steve/Chris--I've been working on putting together a compilation of the 
individual state legislation that passed this year for the midwest region on 
electronic signature authorization.  I saw a blurb in the paper yesterday 
that Congress passed a bill this week out of the House on the same issue.  
Could you give me some insight as to whether the federal legislation is 
comprehensive and will it trump the state legislation or does it granfather 
state legislation.

Jim/Rick:

We have revised the draft paper on market objectives and attributes in
response to Jim's comments. This is attached. Much of the material is the
same but there were a few key items that needed clearing up.

The question of how short-term balancing and spot markets should be
organized is so critical (and potentially requiring a significant policy
shift) that we are writing a (much shorter) separate piece on this subject.
Should be ready late this afternoon for discussion on tomorrow's call.

Bill, the only date I have heard for issuance of a decision is July 12.  As
for the effective date, I wrote to Ann Watson and Linda Serizawa pointing
out that a retroactive suspension of DA would be extremely problematical to
ESPs and probably cause complaints to be filed by customers who had signed
in good faith.  It was then suggested that the effective date should be
subsequent to whatever date a decision is issued.  Watson responded
indicating agreement but pointing out that it was Wood, not Bilas, who was
suspending DA and that Serizawa needed to respond.  Serizawa's only response
was to remind me that the email was an ex parte contact and needed to be
filed, which I already knew, of course.  However, she did not respond on the
issue (why am I not surprised?).

By the way, the memo you discuss in your email was not attached to the
version I received.

GRAY DAVIS' NEW RADIO ADS CONTINUE CAMPAIGN OF LIES AND HALF-TRUTHS
DAVIS CLAIMS CREDIT FOR POWER PLANTS LAUNCHED BEFORE HE EVEN TOOK OFFICE

The launching of statewide radio ads by the Gray Davis campaign, a full 16
months ahead of Election Day, should not come to anyone's surprise.  Nor
should anyone be surprised that the new radio ads are full of the typical
Davis lies and half-truths.

Davis has made raising money for his re-election campaign the #1 goal of his
administration, and obviously that money will be spent to twist Davis'
failed record for those who don't know better. The real news in these ads is
the brazen half-truths that permeate these so-called "energy updates."

The ads are billed as almost public service announcements, but in a real
public service, we here at Russo Marsh + Rogers have to set the record
straight with the entire story:

"Of the 16 new power plants Gray Davis seems to be claiming credit for
almost personally developing and constructing, he actually deserves credit
for none!"

Here are the facts:  Of the 16 plants Davis takes credit for, every single
one was first planned for construction and siting before Davis even became
governor.

Ten actually began the licensing process or applied for state certification
before Davis' term in office began.

And the final 6 plants?  Building a power plant is a major undertaking.
Feasibility studies by the plant builder begin months before the first piece
of paper arrives at the Energy Commission.  If you assume that the builder
of a plant first started internal studies only twelve months before their
first license application, then guess what?  They were started under the
previous administration too!

Furthermore, Gray Davis did not appoint his third member of the 5-member
California Energy Commission until February 2001!  And even that third
appointee was a reappointment of Bill Keese, who was originally appointed by
you guessed it, Pete Wilson, "father of deregulation and all things evil in
California."

The truth is that while Gray Davis is boasting of personally licensing these
16 new plants - the heavy load was carried by the previous administration.
Davis is desperately trying to spin his way out of an energy disaster
created when he fiddled away precious time last year, denied utilities the
right to long-term contracting and falsely insisted he was on top of the
energy "challenge."

The Gray Davis spin machine now takes on a new phase with his $30 million
campaign war chest to rewrite history.   It's no news at all that his
desperate first campaign ads are filled with the same half-truths he's been
repeating since day one.

Fortunately, the RM+R Insider will be here for you, every time, to serve as
the "Truth Squad" against Gray's distortions.

Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us 
to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are 
not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file 
confidential.  

Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers 
if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to 
noncore customers.  
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases 
when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to 
businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is 
below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates 
significantly above the Lynch rates.  
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that 
it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by 
the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates 
again soon. 
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which 
will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or 
tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 
100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive 
market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.
All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome 
and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Elizabeth, etal --

Here is  the file updated from this morning's discussion.  See pages 5 - 11 
for the Re-reg stuff.  Still needs some work but a start.  

John Neslage is working on ensuring the accuracy of the numbers and providing 
a brief write-up.

By the way, the "soft" and "intangibles" are getting difficult to keep 
apart.  Maybe just "hard" and "intangibles" works better?  Any thoughts?

Jim

Electricity traders' tech habits get scrutiny 
Posted at 10:23 p.m. PDT Sunday, June 10, 2001 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


State officials investigating California's extraordinary energy prices are 
zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession 
-- from e-mail and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and 
online trading floors.

This technology may be key, they say, to helping traders acquire the intimate 
knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market. With 
minute-to-minute knowledge of market conditions, some traders went even 
further, two lawsuits charge, illegally coordinating bids and sending 
electricity prices to record-breaking levels.

The state Attorney General's Office has subpoenaed from power generators 
software used to formulate bidding strategies, names of employees providing 
computer support, communications with a prominent industry Web site and the 
name of firms that handle computer networks.

And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant 
to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the state's 
Internet-based spot market, among other things.

``Once you were knowledgeable about its operations, the opportunity to game 
it became pretty obvious,'' said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who chairs 
the committee.


Anti-trust laws

Working together, or colluding, to fix prices is illegal and violates state 
and federal anti-trust laws. 

Sharing sensitive industry data, if it involved financial markets, would be 
considered insider trading and would be treated far differently, said Anjali 
Sheffrin, head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator, which 
manages the state's power grid. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nation's stock markets, 
but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators.

San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin. Aguirre is part of a 
team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generators 
such as Dynegy, Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services.

``It's basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the 
sharing of inside information, and the only reason they're getting away with 
it is there's no SEC cop,'' he said.

Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation.

``All of these `What ifs?' '' said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. ``The fact 
of the matter is we've played by the rules, we've acted ethically, we haven't 
done anything wrong.''

Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board.

``That's something that we're proud of, that we have all of the tools to do 
the best possible job in the trading,'' said Paula Hall-Collins, spokeswoman 
for Tulsa-based Williams Co.

Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike 
prices.

Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus a 
red herring. California's energy problems are far more fundamental, they say, 
than click-happy energy traders with spreadsheets. The now-defunct California 
Power Exchange, for example, was something of a sitting duck, unable to 
freely shop around for the best electricity prices.


Wealth of data

Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around -- from river 
flows to 30-day forecasts of power line outages -- gives traders an unfair 
advantage. ``That's exactly the issue,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of 
the University of California Energy Institute. ``The issue is whether all 
this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to 
the efficiency of procuring and selling power.''

The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder.

In that incident, an energy industry association called the Western Systems 
Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive real-time data about 
transmission of extra-high voltage electricity in California. 

Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market, the state's 
grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the information 
off the site, which it did.

A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that he 
not be identified, said: ``When you can calculate exactly what a market needs 
and where its surplus is going to come from, then you have the ability to 
essentially fix prices. It's like a linear equation. You know exactly what 
the end equation is going to be.''

At issue are how traders employ the tools that, like the telephone and fax 
machine, are standard in trading electricity: software, data Web sites and 
Internet energy exchanges.

Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isn't clear how 
technology was used in suspected abuses. And no one has turned up slam-dunk 
evidence of collusion.

The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices 
through gaming. The high prices have cost the state at least $6.7 billion 
since May 2000.

``Energy traders trade information among themselves,'' the ISO's Sheffrin 
charged, comparing it to insider-trading. ``These traders are calling each 
other up all the time.''

The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy traders 
as a very incestuous group. 

They talk and e-mail every day. ``Sometimes many, many, many times a day,'' 
he said. ``Some of them have instant messaging.'' He said he believes it 
could amount to ``de facto collusion.''

But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult.

The sticking point, said UC's Borenstein, is showing exactly what energy 
traders did with the information.

``These guys aren't actually sitting down in a room together,'' Borenstein 
said. ``They sort of watched each other and said, `Well, other firms are 
keeping capacity out and we will too.' ''

The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove 
collusion because traders will cover their tracks. ``They're expunging 
hard-drive data as we speak,'' he said. ``The documents are long gone.''


Lawsuits

Two class-action lawsuits, filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco and 
by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, accuse the energy companies of colluding to 
drive up prices. Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies 
engaged in secretive data-sharing.

The Bustamante suit, however, targets a new Internet site for wholesale 
energy trading launched last fall by heavy-hitter energy companies such as 
Duke and Reliant. The Atlanta-based Web site, IntercontinentalExchange, is 
one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up on 
the Internet in the last four years. None of these trading exchanges -- which 
analysts say are the wave of the future -- are regulated.

IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the 
suit.

The lawsuit charges the site ``has several features that support collusive 
behavior amongst market participants.'' 

One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange and 
those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders 
out. And more importantly, Aguirre said, the energy companies who own many of 
these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all the 
trades.

``It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has access 
to,'' he said. ``It's a conduit for collusion.''

PENNSYLVANIA -- PUC conditionally supports Verizon interLATA bid

The Public Utility Commission today lent its support to Verizon
Pennsylvania, Inc.'s application to provide in-region interLATA
(local access and transport area) services, subject to several
conditions to ensure market competition.  Today's decision
concludes a formal investigation that began when Verizon
requested the commission's support in January.  (1/9/01)

In a 3-2 vote, the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a
permanent assurance plan with "self-executing" remedies based on
the New York model already accepted by the FCC and to increased
penalties for failure to meet performance standards.  Verizon
said that it will accept these conditions and that it plans to
file its interLATA bid with the FCC "shortly."

Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J. Fitzpatrick
dissented.  Commissioner Brownell said, "I cannot, in good
conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned
under the [federal Telecommunications Act of 1996]."  Both
dissenting commissioners listed several areas in which Verizon
had failed to meet the FCC requirements to determine that local
markets are open to competition.

A WorldCom, Inc., spokesman told TR, "We agree with the
dissenters and hope the FCC will recognize that problems still
exist and force Verizon to fix them prior to allowing them to
offer long distance."

Once Verizon files its market-entry bid with the FCC, the PUC
will present its recommendation.  Section 271 of the Act requires
the FCC to consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and
relevant state regulators before ruling on such applications.
(Docket no. M-00001435, Consultative Report on Application of
Verizon Pennsylvania Inc., for FCC Authorization to Provide In-
Region, InterLATA Service in Pennsylvania)

CONNECTICUT -- SNET challenges city's telecom certification

Southern New England Telecommunications (SNET) has filed an
appeal in Superior Court (New Britain) challenging the Department
of Public Utility Control's decision to grant the city of Groton
a certificate to provide telecom access services.  (Docket no.
00-03-12)

SNET argues that Groton "is not legally empowered to offer
telecommunications services to those who are not inhabitants of
its electric service area" under Connecticut General Statutes =0F5
7-233i.  Groton's customers as defined in its application would
all be noninhabitants, SNET said.

In its April 11 decision, the DPUC agreed with Groton's argument
that "[the statute] has no language prohibiting a municipality
from offering wholesale telecommunications service."

______________________________________________________

TENNESSEE -- BellSouth to ask TRA to support market-entry bid
soon

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., has notified the Regulatory
Authority that it plans to request support for its bid to enter
the Tennessee interLATA (local access and transport area) market
"by the end of July."  Compliance with the 14-point "competitive
checklist" of section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act
is a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region
interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department
of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the
applications.

BellSouth asked the TRA to schedule hearings on its application
for the first week of November.  BellSouth asked the TRA to
support its section 271 bid in 1997, but the company withdrew the
request before the TRA could decide whether to endorse it, a TRA
staff member told TR.

______________________________________________________

MICHIGAN -- PSC adopts '616' area code 'split'

The Public Service Commission yesterday approved a geographic
"split" to relieve number exhaustion in the "616" area code.

A north/south geographic split will be implemented with a
dividing line that follows the northern boundaries of Saugatuck,
Hamilton, Hopkins, Wayland, Middleville, Hastings, and Woodland
rate centers.  Customers in and to the south of these rate
centers will receive a new area code.  Customers to the north of
the rate centers will retain 616.

Permissive dialing will begin by July 13, 2002, and mandatory
dialing will begin Feb. 15, 2003.  Wireless carriers will have an
extended permissive dialing period through Feb. 15, 2004.  (Case
no. U-12850)

______________________________________________________

NEW YORK -- Nassau County restricts use of wireless phones

Nassau County today enacted an ordinance requiring the use of
hands-free devices when operating wireless phones while driving.
"Although mobile phones provide convenience for our busy lives,
their use must conform with the need for public safety," Nassau
County Executive Thomas Gulotta said.

Emergency calls to police, fire, ambulance, or health care
providers are exempt from the requirement.  The ordinance
authorizes the police department to fine up to $100 per
violation, a Nassau County spokesperson told TR.  The ordinance
takes effect July 1.

______________________________________________________

WEST VIRGINIA -- Verizon to appeal $18M access-rate reduction

Verizon West Virginia, Inc., yesterday said it plans to ask the
Public Service Commission to reconsider an order requiring
Verizon to reduce its access rates by $18 million over three
years.  The PSC's order addressed an AT&T Corp. complaint.  While
the reduction is smaller than the $27.6 million suggested by
AT&T, it's larger than the $6 million cut Verizon proposed.

Verizon said that, if given the chance, it would demonstrate that
the PSC was "misguided in seeking to mirror in-state and
interstate access rates."  The telco said the order gives AT&T
and other long distance companies a free ride on its network at
the expense of consumers.

The PSC ordered the access charge reductions to be passed through
to West Virginia toll customers.  Verizon responded, "People
shouldn't hold their breath waiting for AT&T to pass along any
savings."  (Case no. 00-0318-T-C, AT&T Communications of West
Virginia, Inc. v. Bell Atlantic-West Virginia, Inc.)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- Wood proposes 'anticramming' rules

Public Utilities Commissioner Charles Wood has proposed rules to
regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone
bills.  Existing law, which authorizes only communications-
related charges on phone bills, is scheduled to expire July 1.
(1/5/01)  The proposed rules are designed to prevent "cramming,"
which is the placement of unauthorized charges on phone bills.

The proposed rules require telecom companies to obtain a
customer's written consent before including noncommunications
charges on phone bills.  Customers may revoke their consent at
any time without charge and may identify a dollar maximum per
charge and per billing cycle on noncommunications charges.
Telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect
basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications
charges.

Under the proposed rules, telecom companies must take
"reasonable" precautions to screen vendors and billing agents
before agreeing to provide noncommunications billing services for
them.  Noncommunications charges must be identified in a separate
section of phone bills.  Comments are due June 20.  (Rulemaking
00-02-004)

MISSOURI -- House passes rights-of-way bill

The House has passed a bill restricting local governments'
authority to regulate public rights-of-way.  The measure now goes
to Gov. Bob Holden (D.).  Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and
competitive local exchange carriers support the bill, but the
Missouri Municipal League "fought the bill tooth and nail," a
league spokesperson told TR.

SB 369 would prohibit local governments from requiring telecom
companies to obtain a franchise to use rights-of-way but would
grandfather franchise agreements in effect May 1.  The bill would
prohibit rights-of-way rental fees but would authorize local
governments to impose rights-of-way permit fees, which would be
limited to "actual, substantiated costs reasonably incurred" in
managing the public rights-of-way.

Local governments would have to process rights-of-way permit
applications within 31 days after receiving a complete
application.  Telecom and cable TV companies would be authorized
to identify rights-of-way permit fees on customer bills.

______________________________________________________

GEORGIA -- WorldCom says FX calls subject to 'recip comp'

WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Service Commission to
determine that calls originated by BellSouth Telecommunications,
Inc.'s customers to competitive local exchange carriers' foreign-
exchange (FX) customers should be considered local and therefore
subject to reciprocal compensation.  Proper treatment of FX
traffic is required to meet item 13 (reciprocal compensation) of
section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996's 14-
point "competitive checklist," MCI said.

Treating CLECs' FX traffic as long distance provides "significant
competitive advantages" to BellSouth because it permits BellSouth
to assess access charges on local calls and "shields BellSouth's
local FX service from competition," WorldCom said.  (Docket no.
6863-U)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- ALJ suggests requiring Pacific Bell to permit
intraLATA toll presubscription

Administrative Law Judge Karen Jones has recommended that the
Public Utilities Commission require Pacific Bell to permit
MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLC's customers to
presubscribe to Pacific Bell's intraLATA (local access and
transport area) long distance service.  The recommendation was
made in a draft arbitrator's report about the companies'
interconnection agreement.

Pacific Bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers
and would require the company to identify a separate billing
channel or generate a bill solely for intraLATA long distance
service.

"It is blatantly discriminatory for Pacific to refuse to provide
intraLATA toll service to MCI's local service customers," Ms.
Jones said.  She said, "Pacific's arguments of 'customer
confusion' and 'billing' concerns do not have merit."  "Customers
could receive three different bills for the three different
services, and other carriers cope with billing for only one of
those three services.  There is no reason that Pacific should not
be able to provide a bill which includes only intraLATA
services."  Comments on the draft arbitrator's report are due
June 20.  (Application 01-01-010)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- PUC extends deadline for Pacific Bell interLATA
filing

Public Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has extended Pacific
Bell's deadline for filing information demonstrating its
compliance with the interLATA (local access and transport area)
market-entry requirements of section 709.2 of California code.
The section requires the PUC to find that permitting Pacific Bell
to enter the California interLATA market doesn't harm the long
distance market substantially.  The commission also must find
that Pacific Bell's entry is based on fully open local exchange
access and that the company isn't engaging in anticompetitive
behavior or improper cross-subsidization.  (5/7/01)

Pacific Bell asked the PUC to extend the deadline from June 4
until "mid-June," when the company plans to file its section 271
application with the PUC.  Mr. Brown granted the company's
request and said he would establish a comment filing schedule
after Pacific has filed its section 709.2 assessment and section
271 application.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043 and
Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)

IOWA -- Board mulls revoking LTDS's certificate

The Utilities Board has ordered LTDS Corp. to demonstrate why its
operating certificate shouldn't be revoked.  The board is
concerned that "actions on the part of LTDS do not appear to be
the actions of a bona fide competitive local exchange carrier."

The board said there appears to be no voice traffic from or to an
LTDS customer in any exchange other than Fairfield.  The company
ordered and then cancelled orders for voice trunks in the Pella,
Chariton, and Centerville exchanges.  It ordered trunks in the
Grinnell and Sigourney exchanges, although it has no assigned
"NXX" codes there.  The company's tariff also fails to include a
residential rate.  It was deleted in a Jan. 19 tariff revision,
the board said.

It said state law obligates each local exchange utility to serve
all eligible customers within the utility's service territory,
unless explicitly excepted from the requirement by the board.
(Iowa Code section 476.29(5))

LTDS must file direct testimony by June 22.  Petitions to
intervene are due July 3.  Additional comments from the consumer
advocate and intervenors are due July 17.  Prepared rebuttal
testimony from LTDS will be due Aug. 3.  A hearing is scheduled
for Aug. 14.  (Docket no. TCU-01-13 - In Re: LTDS Corporation)

NEBRASKA -- PSC to discuss implementing '511'

The Public Service Commission has scheduled an Aug. 15 workshop
to address implementation of the "511" dialing code as an
Advanced Traveler Weather Information System (ATWIS).  It will
provide route-specific weather forecasts and road condition
reports to callers based on specific location information they
provide.

The PSC approved implementation of 511 for the ATWIS May 23.  The
commission directed the Department of Roads and the Nebraska
State Patrol to begin deploying the ATWIS.  (Application no. C-
2506/PI-48 - In the Matter of the Application of the Commission,
on its own motion, to seek comment on the establishment and
implementation of '511' as a statewide three-digit calling number
reserved for access to ATWIS)

______________________________________________________

NEBRASKA -- PSC seeks copies of MDU contracts

The Public Service Commission has requested by June 15 copies of
all contracts that all certified telecom carriers have entered
into with multiple dwelling units (MDUs).

In April 1999 the PSC issued an order clarifying its policy for
residential MDU access.  Qwest Corp. appealed the PSC's order to
the Nebraska Supreme Court, which affirmed a majority of it.  The
court remanded to the PSC the issue of whether the rates it set
for MDU access comply with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit's (St. Louis) decision in Iowa Utilities Board v.
FCC (120 F. 3d 753).

After reviewing the case's testimony, the PSC said it's
"disturbed" that some telecom carriers still may be utilizing
contracts with MDUs that contain exclusive access and/or
exclusive marketing provisions "in apparent blatant disregard of
prior orders of this commission, as well as the FCC."  (Docket
no. C-2534/PI-50 - The Commission, on its own motion, to examine
the potential noncompliance with Commission orders entered in
Docket no. C-1878/PI-23)

CONNECTICUT -- DPUC expands Lifeline assistance in tribal areas

The Department of Public Utility Control has amended its Lifeline
plan to enhance assistance to individuals living on American
Indian tribal lands.  The measure adds language proposed by
Southern New England Telecommunications, which enhances
"subscribership and infrastructure deployment" within American
Indian communities by including a Lifeline credit of up to $30.25
per month and reducing Link Up service connection charges to
qualified applicants by $100.

The amendment follows an Oct. 5, 2000, FCC order to encourage
increased subscribership and infrastructure rollout in tribal
areas.  (Common Carrier docket 96-45)

MICHIGAN -- Customers can bring complaints without counsel

The Public Service Commission yesterday ruled that business and
residential telephone customers can bring "slamming" or
"cramming" complaints to the commission without the assistance of
an attorney.  The PSC's ruling involved a complaint filed by
Seaway Painting LLC against WorldCom, Inc., about a billing
dispute.

The PSC dismissed the complaint, as requested by the petitioner,
but concluded that Seaway may refile its complaint and proceed
"with the assistance of a person of its choice, who need not be a
licensed attorney."  The commission based its decision on a
provision of the Michigan Telecommunications Act, which provides,
"Hearings shall be conducted in a manner as to optimize
expediency, convenience, and the ability of end users to bring
and prosecute, without the assistance of counsel, complaints
alleging [slamming or cramming] while preserving the rights of
the parties."  (Case no. U-12863)

OREGON -- Group criticizes AT&T price hike

The Qwest Communications International, Inc.-backed Oregon
Coalition for Consumer Choice yesterday criticized AT&T Corp. for
its recent announcement of an 11% increase in consumer long
distance rates.  "This rate hike from AT&T just underscore the
importance of bringing real competition to the Oregon long
distance market," said Dan Lavey, coalition director.

The group said Qwest's entry into the Oregon interLATA (local
access and transport area) market would save a customer who made
only one 10-minute long distance call $2.80 per month, more than
$33 a year, over AT&T.

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

Best regards
Mark Crowther

Re:  the speech.

(1) Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated 
that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to 
speak.  The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in 
energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders.

(2) I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorp's reaction to the notion 
that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs 
(at the retail level).  Another representative for one of the coal concerns 
made the same comment.  These comments took us towards a discussion of what 
went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity.  

I partly agreed with PacifiCorp--i.e., I agreed that we were in a state of 
transition in the wholesale and retail markets.  I also pointed out that:  
(1) we couldn't look at California and reach any conclusion other than they 
messed up; (2) we didn't have an entirely free market in electricity in the 
West--i.e., it's a hybrid of regulation, etc.; and (3) that the model 
discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity (a point 
that the Gov. also made).  I said that it applies to wholesale electric 
markets in some areas, coal markets, gas markets, and that the model applies 
in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated.  

I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling, restructuring 
etc., because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to 
maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming.  The Governor on a number 
of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction (i.e., away from 
retail).  

(3) Nancy Vanderberg (El Paso--a former Enron employee) sends her regards.  
She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming.  
I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers.  

(4) The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from 
competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill 
off smaller local competitors.  I responded with the usual--make sure no 
barriers to entry, when the price gets high enough competitors will take on 
WalMart, etc.

(5) Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately.  
In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on 
RTOs, ensuring that all customers are treated the same, etc.  The Gov. gave a 
number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West, etc.

(6) The Gov. mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy 
resources available to producers in Wyoming.   He also pointed out 
deficiencies in Wyoming-East connections on both gas and electric as well as 
deficiencies in Wyoming-Calfornia pipeline constraints.  


A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne (FYI)

(7) The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission (Steve 
Reynolds) are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron.  I 
affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be 
contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient.

(8)  These guys are serious and dedicated.  The Commission was given a $1 
million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on 
behalf of the state.  During the meeting the Commission approved a series of 
additional meetings, working groups and advisory committees.  Sue Landwehr 
and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the 
meetings, working groups, etc.

(9) My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor 
and the Governor's staff are familiar with how commodity markets 
work--particularly ag products.  They understand the concept of basis and 
also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is 
adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity.  
They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission 
system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints moving north, 
south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline 
serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and some 
problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  While 
they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't been able 
to put it all together in a cohesive way.  

(10) Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west (and the rest of the 
country), but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent 
state.  (For example, the state moved from a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 
to an approximately $750 million surplus in FY 2000).  They also want to 
diversify the state's economy and bring economic development.  For example, a 
major focus of the state's Business Council has been to recruit "server 
farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  They talked about 
co-locating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state 
(which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available). 

(11) The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging.  In his 
comments to the Commission, PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the 
state should clarify the utility's responsibility to either:  (1) build their 
own power plants; or (2) acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge.  Steve 
talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how 
the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in 
2000/2001--because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices.  
Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail level--but 
silent on electric restructuring.

Rick, just giving myself a pat on the back for convincing FERC staff to 
release all of our wind generation projects from the FERC reporting 
requirements relating to monitoring of CA plant outages.  Regards,  Ray

I think this e-mail from FERC staff finalizes the matter, and we need not 
report the information sought in the FERC letters of May 1 and May 18 for the 
Green Power Project or any of our other wind power projects.  I would advise 
that we all keep a record of these e-mail exchanges, in the event a question 
ever arises.  Regards,  Ray

Dear Mr. Alvarez:
 
I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.  Enron does not have to 
report outages for its Green Power Project because it is a small wind unit.  
 
Sincerely,
 
Stuart Fischer

>>> <Ray.Alvarez@enron.com> 06/01/01 06:09PM >>>

Dear Mr. Fischer:

The Green Power Project is 16.5 mW. Enron Wind Corp. never shuts this plant
off; wind turbines are maintained individually. The plant has a 95%
availability, which means that only 5% of the turbines should be off line
for maintenance at any given time.

Very truly yours,

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

Dear Mr. Robinson:

Reference is made to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC)
letter dated May 1, 2001, directed to Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI),
relating to the above captioned subject.

The letter seeks outage information (the information) about generation
units in the State of California owned and/or operated by EPMI or any of
its affiliates.  As discussed in our recent telephone conversations,  Enron
Wind Corp., an affiliate of EPMI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp., owns and operates various wind generation units in the state.  All
of these units, save for one, are QF's, and it is my understanding that you
are not be seeking the information on such units since their power is
subject to bilateral contracts with IOU's.  The remaining unit is the Green
Power Project in Palm Springs.  Enron Wind Corp. has a bilateral contract
with EPMI on the Green Power Project.

As regards the Green Power Project, the name of the contact person you
request is:

Mr. Tom Biernet
Vice President- Operations
Enron Wind Corp.
(661) 823-6750

A review of our files indicates that no outage reports or notices have been
sent to the CAISO or CPUC as of May 1, 2001, relating to the Green Power
Project.  Should any such notice or report be generated in the future, it
will be forwarded to your attention.

Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (202) 464-9170.

Very truly yours,

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

Just a quick overview of observations/conversations from the South Sound 
Technology Conference in Tacoma yesterday.  The conference was a regional 
gathering on Puget Sound area leaders, telecom/tech, and educators.  Notable 
participants were Rep. Adam Smith, Sen. Cantwell, and Gov. Locke.  Rep. Norm 
Dicks' office was there but he was on a defense trip to Europe.  

Statements from Maria Cantwell:  
She hoped the change in the Senate will change the direction of the Bush 
Energy plan and she endorsed the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation as 
much needed relief for the Northwest.  
She described her support for competition in the telecom industry.  (while 
not specific, it was a reference to Tauzin/Dingell which she didn't seem 
supportive of).
She endorsed S.88, the Sen. Rockefeller bill to create tax incentives for 
broadband deployment.

I didn't get any time with Sen. Cantwell, but I did spend some time with 
Stacy Baird, her LD and her Chief of Staff (whose name escapes me at the 
moment).  I followed up with Stacy on our conversation last week in DC and he 
told me that he was interested in EBS' thoughts on telecom issues going 
forward after Tauzin/Dingell fades.

Statements from Gov. Locke:
Gov. Locke wanted the state to do a better job reaching out to area 
businesses and encouraged more public/private parnerships.  He gave the 
example of too many streets being ripped up for fiber and that the state 
should provide more leadership in managing infrastructure development.
The energy situation will be a critical factor in tech growth in WA.  He 
stated that some high-tech companies are threatening to leave Silicon Valley 
because of the energy crises and that WA may find itself in a similar 
position. 

Unfortunately I didn't get an opportunity to speak with Locke after his 
remarks. 

Statements from Rep. Adam Smith
He pretty much echoed Locke's concern that energy supply and prices may cause 
the region to lose jobs.  
He supported Tauzin/Dingell stating that he didn't think most people 
understood the "seriousness" of broadband infrastructure issues.  He seemed 
to believe that the RBOCs are the only hope for immediate DSL roll-out.

I spoke with Rep. Smith for about 10 minutes, mostly about telecom 
competition.  He mentioned that he had spoken to "Enron's DC people" about 
energy, but I was unable to ascertain if it was a positive dialogue or not.  
On telecom competition he had much the same perspective as Rep. Boucher last 
week (RBOCs need to invest in new facilities free of competitors), but 
recognized the point that the RBOCs should not be rewarded for years of 
foot-dragging after the Telecom Act.  

I also made a good contact w/ Rep. Dicks' district director who wants to 
follow up on telecom infrastructure/trading issues.

MEDIA:

I was approached by to reprters, TV and print, to discuss energy, Gov. Davis, 
and his meeting w/ Pres. Bush.  I declined and directed them to Karen Denne.l


Takeaways:

The conference was a good opportunity to get our message out - I was able to 
talk about the benefits of bandwidth trading AND the need to open the cable 
monopoly,
I made some good contacts with Qwest, Terrabeam (laser last-mile company), 
and the WA Software Alliance (Lew McMurran, their director of public affairs 
mentioned he knew and worked with Paul Kaufman).
Energy is a HUGE issue in the tech community and it was never far from the 
discussion.  I was asked on the panel, "If Enron is advocating a new 
commodity structure for telecom like it did for electricity, can we expect 
CA-like problems in the future?"  I think I answered it well, but I think we 
will find it tougher to separate out businesses/messages in the future.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Scott

As discussed with you last week, Governor Pataki is holding a fundraiser for 
his reelection campaign in Houston on Monday, June 4th. (His current terrm 
expires in 2002.) According to the fundraiser organizing this event, 
Elizabeth Blakemore (713-526-3399), there will be a reception from 5-6:30 
p.m. at the home of Judy and Jack Holmes in River Oaks, followed by a dinner 
at 7 for approximately 20 people at a location to be determined. Governor 
Perry will be attending the reception, but not the dinner. All proceeds from 
the fundraiser will go to the Pataki campaign. Tickets to the dinner are 
$5,000.00 per person.

When I spoke with Blakemore last week, she indicated that the event was being 
chaired by Bill Wise from El Paso, but she was willing to figure out a way to 
get Ken or Jeff equal billing. She indicated that they do not yet have a 
location for the dinner and suggested that it might be hosted in Ken or 
Jeff's home. She also suggested that if we were willing to commit to $25,000, 
we should be given co-chair status and would check with Pataki's office to 
confirm that. I spoke with Blakemore today (5/11) and she confirmed that we 
would definitely be given co-chair status for a $25k contribution. (She noted 
that there may in fact be one or two others as well.) 

I recommend that we co-host the event. As Rick correctly noted, we don't have 
much of a relationship with Pataki, and this would give us a chance to begin 
to establish closer ties with him. As you may be aware, NY law limits 
corporate donations to NY candidates in any one year to $5,000.00 in the 
aggregate. However, every individual corporation is allowed to make a 
separate $5,000.00 contribution. 

For the time being, I asked Blakemore to use me as her contact person. But it 
makes sense to get her hooked up with someone in Houston. Let me know how you 
want to proceed.

Richard S. Shapiro
Managing Director & Senior Vice President
Government Affairs - The Americas
Enron Corp.
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002-7361

Dear Richard:

Thanks again for taking the time for our telephone call last Wednesday. I
thoroughly enjoyed our talk. As per your request, I've attached a copy of my
CV for your review.

What I hope and believe you will realize as you review my qualifications is
that my skills, experience, problem-solving capability and drive to succeed
uniquely position me to make an immediate and lasting positive contribution
to Enron's government relations and public affairs activities at many
levels.

Firstly, my experience within the Ontario government and the network of
contacts I've developed as a result would be of immediate value to Enron. We
both know that an intense, coordinated and targeted effort will be required
from now to beyond the next provincial election to ensure that the Ontario
market opens successfully and remains open. My unique understanding of the
key players and issues involved in the opening of the Ontario market could
be of significant value to your company through this period.

Secondly, even as local market-opening events play themselves out in
Ontario, a broader set of potential opportunities is appearing for Enron
continentally, with the Bush administration's push for a hemispheric energy
policy. The unveiling of the proposed package by the President has ignited a
continent-wide debate that will have significant impact on the shape and
substance of the policies finally adopted by governments across the
hemisphere. Clearly, it is in Enron's interest to participate in and shape
this debate, to ensure that the final policy packages enhance your economic
interests. To meet this goal, a clear set of objectives must be identified,
an effective strategy to accomplish them developed and a coordinated,
sustained campaign planned and executed. My understanding of the varied
issues and actors at play in this debate, coupled with my understanding of
how to strategically plan and manage persuasion campaigns would be of
significant value to Enron as you prepare to meet this goal on a continental
basis.

Lastly, in addition to providing value to Enron both locally and
continentally in the specific ways described above, I would appreciate most
the opportunity to provide value to your company at a truly macro level, by
helping you participate and succeed in the ongoing global debate on the
ideology of open markets, entrepreneurial activity and free trade. The
ideological conflict between advocates of the state and champions of
individual freedoms and choice can be seen at the heart of all of Enron's
challenges, be they in Ontario, India or elsewhere, and the debate - with
its' significant global implications - is far from over. History clearly
demonstrates that opening markets and freeing entrepreneurial and consumer
activity is the key to enhancing the quality of life for individuals across
the globe. By pursuing these noble goals, companies like Enron are
performing a global public good. Putting my skills to work for Enron in this
global debate would truly be my pleasure.

Once again, I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss with you my
qualifications and how I can assist Enron in achieving your government
relations and public affairs goals. Please feel free to contact me at your
convenience.

Yours truly,



Bill Hawkins

FERC issued orders last night in the two New York dockets regarding extension 
of NYISO's $1,000 bid cap and extension of the ISO's TEP authority.  FERC 
grants extension of both authorities until October 31, 2001.  The ISO 
requested that both the bid cap and the TEP authority be extended for another 
18 months, but FERC found this time period to be too long, given that:  i) 
the ISO is fixing many of the problems with its markets, ii) new supply is 
being added in New York, and iii) demand response programs are being 
implemented.  

Chairman Hebert dissented from both orders, arguing that it is time for both 
measures to lapse.  Hebert is encouraged, however, by the majority's 
rejection of ISO's request to extend these measures for 18 months, and Hebert 
hopes that his colleagues will eliminate these procedures after this summer.

Please call me if you have any questions.  We're still waiting for the 
Commission's order on the Mirant complaint on the Circuit Breaker proposal.

Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week.  
Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses 
with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity 
hoarding are two examples.  The funny money argument assumes marketing 
affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess 
payment is going to the corporate bottom line.  Hoarding capacity to drive up 
price  may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone 
can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, 
but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to 
require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller 
entities put together bids.  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing 
compliance, but in a non-public way.

There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an 
opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.  I would like to put the 
following in these comments:

Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.  The best folks can 
do is make up stuff.
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the 
marketplace that abuse is not occurring.  But the issue is really whether we 
do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors 
who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).
The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules 
are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.
That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to 
include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate 
pipelines.
The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to 
download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently 
the case.

We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a 
discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.  
This was a deal brought up in the conference.

Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.

This confirms our discussion re:  staffing issues in San Francisco:

(1) I will contact Chris Calger when he returns to Portland next week and get 
his support for the change in Sandy's reporting relationship.  I will also 
contact Jeff Dasovich and Susan Mara.  

(2) I will contact H.R. to confirm our messaging for the PRC process and the 
lattitude I have in delivering the mid-term review.  

(3) I will deliver the change in reporting relationships for Sandy so that it 
coincides with the mid-year break in the legislative cycle.

(4) We will delay any other reporting changes in the West until after the 
mid-year PRC process.

I am not trying to flog an issue or point, but in going through some recent, 
but still dated, e-mails, I saw this one from Professor Littlechild.  It 
gives you some sense of what he is trying to work on for us.  It does not 
really do justice to all that he can do and has done, but before I delete 
this, I wanted to pass it along.  I know Peter supposedly has this marked in 
his diary for cancellation on the day it comes due, and you may well decide 
that that is the appropriate course of action, but at least wanted to pass 
this along, because I think any decision to cancel needs your objective 
evaluation, something I think is lacking in Peter's judgment (how you can 
decide to cancel without having seen the man's work, plus I do not think 
Peter appreciates/understands the value, nor the nuances, of the argument 
that you need a contracts market and retail competition, otherwise he would 
support this work, since it bears directly on the Acceleration Directives 
that he is supposed to be pushing in Brussels!).  Hope all is going well.  
See you at the PRC if not sooner.   mcs

Dear Mark
 
We had a brief but helpful meeting on 7 February,  since when I have 
discussed and signed a contract with Annette Patrick. I was  hoping to begin 
work before now, but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded  this. I thought 
it would be helpful to recap where we now are and what I have in  mind.
 
You summarised the three topics where further work  would be helpful to you as
1. What went wrong in California? (and why it  should not preclude further 
liberalisation in Europe)
2. The importance of accelerated EU directives,  including the importance of 
separation of functions.
3. The importance of retail marketing, including to  residential customers.
 
On the first topic, I have recently published a  paper in the Journal of 
Applied Corporate Finance, Winter 2001 edition (which  incidentally features 
Enron in a couple of the other articles). Copy attached.  Most of it is 
familiar stuff but there is a concluding section on California  which answers 
the What went wrong question. We could aim to bring this to a  wider 
audience, but there are lots of papers on this topic now, and the  situation 
changes almost daily, so it may be better to incorporate it into a  paper on 
Europe.
 
On the second topic, I accepted an invitation to  address an analysts' 
conference (UBS Warburg) this coming Monday, on the topic  of regulatory 
policy in Europe and where it is going. I knew nothing about the  topic at 
the time, but thought it would force me to learn.  Unfortunately  there has 
been little time to do this so far. The topic ties in with the work we  
discussed, and if acceptable to you I propose to spend the next couple of 
days  working on it under the contract, with a view not just to the 
presentation, but  to a  subsequent paper and publication. I should say that 
the conference  pays a fee, but only enough to cover travel and conference 
time and the  presentation itself, not any underlying research time. 
 
I see from press reports that there has been some  development or lack of it 
with respect to discussions on the EU directive.  I  hope to talk to Kyran on 
this and related topics, either today or tomorrow, and  maybe he has 
something that he can email me. Perhaps next week we can talk about  how to 
take this work forward, and where to aim at - either a journal like  PowerUK, 
or as a direct input into some EU process.
 
On the third topic, my ideas are embodied in the  paper on Joskow that you 
have seen.The question is how best to publicise and  apply these ideas - 
perhaps in a paper on Europe again? That is, to argue for  the importance of 
the directives in a particular respect, namely retail  competition, and to 
show how California failed to do this  adequately?
 
On now to European regulation.
Best wishes
Stephen

Subject:	Calif. regulators propose tiered electric rate rise

Calif. regulators propose tiered electric rate rise
(UPDATE: Adds details throughout)

SAN FRANCISCO, May 9 (Reuters) - The California Public Utilities Commission 
on Wednesday proposed two plans to increase electricity rates in the 
power-starved state through a tiered retail pricing system.

The parallel plans, submitted by an administrative law judge and CPUC 
President Loretta Lynch, are designed to encourage energy conservation by the 
24 million customers of PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - news) Pacific Gas & Electric 
unit and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) Southern California Edison 
subsidiary.

Higher rates also would allow the state to begin to recover money from 
utility bills to pay for power it has purchased on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities, Lynch said.

The plans are expected to be voted on Monday by the five-member CPUC. 
Approval would implement the commission's March 27 move to raise retail power 
prices to help recover soaring costs of wholesale power.

The March decision did not specify how the rate increases would affect 
different classes of electric customers.

The plans, announced by Lynch, would raise rates 20 percent to 50 percent for 
commercial and industrial customers, and 41 percent to 48 percent for all 
electricity used by residential customers in excess of a percentage of their 
existing base usage.

Lynch told a news conference, however, that up to half of California's 
residential customers who meet certain conservation targets would not face 
higher rates.

Electricity rate hikes for agricultural customers served by PG&E and SoCal 
Edison would be capped at 23 percent to 30 percent, she added.

Paul Clanon, a CPUC energy director, said the rate plans would raise $5 
billion this year from utility customers, with some of the money channeled to 
the California Department of Water Resources, which is buying electricity on 
behalf of the state.

The CPUC has not decided, however, exactly how much of monthly utility bills 
would flow to the agency.

California's power purchases this year have drained the state treasury of 
some $6 billion.

The state Senate on Wednesday approved a bill to issue $13.4 billion in bonds 
to pay for emergency power and sent the measure to Gov. Gray Davis, who is 
expected to sign it.

The Senate's approval came two days after the state Assembly passed the power 
bond measure as a piece of regular -- rather than emergency session -- 
legislation, meaning California will have to wait at least 90 days to issue 
the debt.

The bond issue aims to repay the state for the power purchases, with the debt 
to be paid off over 15 years through a portion of the monthly utility bills.

Some thoughts --

1. We argue against the PJM Installed Capacity obligation.  Basically it is 
another rent capture system for generators.  

2. Don't really understand your stranded cost recovery scheme.  Looks like a 
transmission level charge.  Is it $/mw or $/mwh?  

3. Your model for a pool doesn't solve the key problem of market power.  
Putting a pool in place w/o dealing w/ market power is a recipe for disaster.

4. You don't talk about "Market Based Rate" authority.  Would all generators, 
including incumbent generation be allowed to bid their price or must they bid 
cost?  This is critical.  This is the real carrot to get the Utilities off of 
the stick - mandatory participation with cost-based bidding for Incumbents 
until under 1,000 (?) HHI.

Good luck,

Jim

Subject: Recommendations for Japanese Electricity Reform

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

Best regards
Mark Crowther

The Following are our  recommended changes to the agreement( I would also 
like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):

Page 2, item (3) should read "The payment of a "project fee" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read "The payment of a "project fee" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to "project fee" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. ("Haywood Power"), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility ("Lagoon Creek"), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. ("Calvert"), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a "Development 
Project"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an "Approved Project"). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an 
Approved Project as defined herein.

Local Public radio over the weekend had a story that Gov Davis, once seen for 
dead on the national front, has risen from the dead now that he has gone on 
the attack against Bush's energy plan -- I don't agree that he has riden yet, 
but that is certainly his plan.

Link is for an Orange County register article that discusses his Gore hires 
and notes his Washington strategy.

Rick - 

 I've printed the budget report for your cost center.  

The cost center report indicates that the budget for outside services if 
8,685,000 so we will need to talk to Elizabeth or someone in accounting why 
that number is not 9,000,000.  

The cost center report indicates that we have spent 1,137,638.34 for outside 
services which leaves a variance to budget of 7,547,361.66 available.  

The RCR Budget Report indicates that we have approved 2,235,071 year to 
date.  If you take the amount spent for outside services plus the amount 
approved to date for RCR's the total equals 3,372,709.34.  If you take the 
3,372,709.34 less budget the variance is 5,312,290.66 available.  That 
assumes that the approved to date RCR will all be spent in 2001 and does not 
account for what has been spent to date for RCR costs.

The budget report for your cost center indicates that actuals year to date 
equal 4,951,697.40 compared to an annual budget of 21,437,591 leaves a 
variance of 16,485,893.60 available for the year.

 I hope this information is helpful and is what you needed.  Call with any 
questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

Rick - I'm running the SAP report for March for your cost center and that 
will confirm the budget number and let you know how much was 
charged/coded/paid to date for outside services; the total budget for outside 
services is 9 million; I'll send another email with the budget information as 
soon as the reports print; the RCR budget report shows the variance between 
amount approved and budget but does not show the amount charged to date 
against those RCR's but I can run a report with that information; let me 
know; thanks - Eric

Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, 
Joshua Sheinkman.

As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of 
operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more 
details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of 
financial information.
The additional details they are looking for include: what information should 
be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made 
available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested 
that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, 
whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned 
utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this 
happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending 
FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the 
legislation.
Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and 
forward to Linda. Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some 
legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at 
joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov.
Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the 
legislation.  (Linda)
It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to 
use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible 
for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction. (Linda and Joe)

		 Subject: Is Price Gouging Root of Crisis?

Following is the editorial that resulted from IEP's editorial board meeting 
with the Orange County register on 
May 24:


Is price gouging root of crisis? 
Orange County Register Editorial
May 21, 2001

The president is "allowing the price-gouging energy companies, many of whom 
reside in Texas, to get away with murder," Gov. Gray Davis said on Thursday 
in response to a George W. Bush energy plan that doesn't call for caps on the 
price of electricity sold by out-of-state generators to California. 

This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy 
problems: Blame everybody else, call for government price controls even 
though they historically have reduced the supply of energy, and use divisive 
and even conspiratorial rhetoric.

On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan, his 
appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told a 
newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack 
up prices. Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of what 
Ms. Lynch called "artificial shortages."

We're interested in seeing the evidence, of course. But it looks suspiciously 
like politicians are using the "power-gouging" theory as a way to bluster 
rather than come up with concrete solutions. It also is a way for those who 
are ideologically hostile to deregulation - perhaps cynical of business and 
capitalism in general - to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for 
a government takeover.

No doubt, wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. Prices zoomed from 
$200 a megawatt hour late last year to nearly $2,000 last week, according to 
the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a 
cause of the price spike.

Yet a number of analysts have found the price-gouging theory to be dubious. A 
Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data 
on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers. Yes, there were 
nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big 
producers in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. But, as writer Mark Golden 
pointed out, outages for all plants - including municipally owned ones and 
small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system - were 
658 percent higher in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. The writer notes that 
"four of the Big 5 are either constructing big new generators in California 
or have applied for permits to do so. That would seem to fly in the face of a 
withholding strategy."

An April paper co-authored by William Hogan, a professor at the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, could not prove there 
wasn't manipulation, but explained, "it is unlikely to be the dominant factor 
and may not even be significant."

The bigger issue, the Hogan paper argued, is the "seriously flawed" 
restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse. "[T]he 
principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the 
other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the 
underlying causes of the market meltdown."

Other analysts argue that, to whatever degree price-gouging has taken place, 
it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules 
that have distorted the market.

The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy, the 
power generators say, but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that 
have been overworked. Many of these are older plants that require more 
shutdowns for maintenance than new ones.

"People can invest money in various different markets," Jan Smutny-Jones told 
us; he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association 
in Sacramento, which represents QFs and merchant generators. With politically 
charged hearings, demonization of power generators, proposals for 
excess-profits taxes and threats of seizing property made by California 
Democrats, he said generators may conclude that California is a dangerous 
place to invest.

Gov. Davis said the Bush plan won't add any new electrical power. But neither 
will Davis' grandstanding about price-gougers. 

In fact, it may even dissuade electricity investment. The governor needs to 
apply his "will it create new power?" standard to his own rhetoric, then get 
busy leading the state out of this mess.

Rick - 

Attached are the monthly reports received from Linda Robertson, Jean Ryall, 
Paul Kaufman and Ricardo Charvel.  The monthly report for Canada is in 
progress but I have confirmed with Aleck that there are no changes to the 
project list he supplied for the Woodlands offsite.

In addition, attached is an updated Resources Report for your review and use.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

Pat Wood may be at FERC in about three weeks.  He will be in Washington next 
week and confirmation may take place two to three weeks from today. 

At the PUCT - still no selection of commissioners - at the top of list is 
Steve Barron from the Attorney General's office. (Pat Wood thinks he will be 
a good commissioner.) 

Gov. Perry's appointment person, Dealy Herndon, is pushing Suzie McClellan.  
Suzie has been at OPUC for the last couple of years.  She has never been 
pro-competition (quite the contrary).  However, she is the daughter-in-law of 
Carol Keeton- Rylander. I heard Gov. Perry and other have rejected her, but 
Dealy keeps pushing.  I don't think she will make it.

Gov. Perry wants to select someone he personally knows and trusts, that also 
has experience.  He has rejected the "short list" a couple of times.  Diana 
Liebman is still in the running.  Although many have said that Stephanie 
Kroger is conflicted out, I heard she may still be considered (Pat Wood 
really likes her).  Other names floating around include Julie Parsley and 
Scott Sherman.

The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said "some  people" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay "a ton."? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a "big  problem" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
"You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK."
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? "The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards."
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable"  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  "health and welfare" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities."? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
"potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration."? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are  suffering."? 
Continued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption,"  and that 
there will be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define "fair and justifiable";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  "fellow 
Republicans" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because "5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 
20, 2001 
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 


Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

		 Subject: RE: Lay/Harris Meeting

Rob, just to reiterate one point Paul and I were  trying to make on   our 
conference call  - We both  think it would be a  mistake to delete from the 
discussion with Harris et al  our views regarding prices and resource 
adequacy.  The biggest political  fear of the gov't going forward is that 
consumers will see a big jump in prices once the market opens.  For 
instance,  that fear underlies  the suggestion that  market opening should 
await the return to service of the first Pickering A unit.  - the idea (right 
or wrong)  is that Pickering will provide  greater reliability and price 
stability. The biggest fear  of the  government - based on our discussions 
with the politicians and their advisors  - is  the prospect of headlines in 
the Toronto Star et al about high prices in the IMO markets, whether or not a 
rebate is ultimately payable down the road. They saw the problems that  high 
prices posed for Klein earlier this year and are fearful of being caught in 
the same position. The Harris gov't is far more vulnerable than Klein  ever 
was.   We are concerned that it  is not an adequate answer to the gov't's 
political concerns  to say that high prices will simply increase the cashflow 
to the government's own coffers (via OPG) to be redistributed at some later 
date to  Ontario electricity consumers.  Remember that, in any event,  the 
MPMA rebate is calculated on the basis of annual revenues and that estimates 
are that consumers may not see an MPMA  payout until six months after the end 
of the year.  Our own extensive analysis and our own forward curves for 
Ontario indicate that significant price increases  (compared to the new OPG 
bulk power rate of $48 MWh ) are unlikely.  This is a reassuring assessment 
and we think it is important to share that view with gov't.   We can't rely 
entirely on the existence of the mitigants; we have to address the underlying 
concern about price spikes and high prices.  We think we have a good story to 
tell in that regard.  Pleased to talk about this further.  Aleck

            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

RE: National Energy Policy Issues

We received the attached document from Scott Miller on the OMTR staff at 
FERC.  Scott is concerned that the current discussion of a national energy 
strategy does not include a meaningful focus on critical electric issues.  
Both at FERC and with lawmakers, Scott is encouraging people to stress the 
issues identified in this paper in an effort to focus decision-makers on the 
needs of the electric industry in the current debate.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Julie Simon at EPSA, 202-628-8200 or

E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and
public utility law.

March 6, 2001

Supreme Court Grants Review of FERC Order No. 888

Earlier last week, the United States Supreme Court granted two petitions for
certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit's decision in Transmission Access
Study Group v. FERC, 225 F.3d 667 (2000) regarding FERC Order No. 888, which
required open-access and non-discriminatory transmission service.  The
Supreme Court has agreed to review legal challenges set forth in separate
petitions filed by several states led by New York and Enron Power Marketing.


The issue the multi-state petition presents for review is whether FERC may
preempt state jurisdiction over energy transmitted from generators to retail
customers in the same state.  The Court also granted Enron's petition to
consider two far-reaching questions with major implications for the power
industry: (1) does FERC have jurisdiction to regulate all transmission in
interstate commerce, including transmission for bundled retail sales; and
(2) does the Federal Power Act obligate FERC to eliminate undue
discrimination by requiring transmission-owning utilities to provide service
on the same terms to all users, including bundled retail sales?

The Court has joined the two petitions for purposes of oral argument and
decision.  Oral arguments in the two cases will not be scheduled before
October 2001 and a decision is not likely until 2002.

Rick:

Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?

I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how
the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion).
That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this
in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and
effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g.
PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely,
and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how
people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.

We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of
the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up
advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and
implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or
just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present
this to Steve Kean.

Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to
have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you
can reach me on (617) 513-5904 (cellphone).

Subject: Duty Calls

It is with mixed emotions that I must announce that I will be leaving
Calpine effective Friday, June 8th.  I have been asked by the Bush
Administration to go back and serve again.

In my new life, beginning on June 11th, I will be the Senior Electric
Policy Advisor to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.  In this role I will be
responsible for helping craft the Administration's electric
restructuring bill, evaluate the feasibility of a national electric grid,
help advise the administration on the steps necessary to help solve our
western electric crisis, work with Congress, and help craft many other 
policies that will
positively impact the competitive electric industry.  This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity that I felt I could not pass up.

I do not yet have a new email but will forward it when I get it.

My new phone number is 202-586-7131 (after June 11th).

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  While Steve got it wrong, I think that it doesn't hurt for Sarah and 
Linda to know Dan Clearfield.  He was the attorney that helped negotiate the

Subject: FERC Work

Jim, Steve Huntoon indicated that you are now in charge of federal lobbying 
(lucky you!)  I wanted to touch base and see if you thought that I might be 
of some service in light of Nora ascension.  One idea I had is some task 
force or other group (funded primarily by Enron) in support of state market 
opening steps.  The purpose of the task force is to push the FERC to take 
actions that help the states to continue to move to open markets and/or to 
oppose steps that aren't pro-competition.  I don't know whether this idea has 
any legs or not.  Or, perhaps we could participate on behalf of Enron at FERC 
on specific issues that fall into this category.  Just a thought. Hope all is 
well with you and your family.

I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.  I gave him this 
statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1) 
"what is Enron's actual exposure?", 2) "what was Enron's opinion of Gov. 
Davis' speech last night?", and 3) "was this PG&E's only option?"  I did 
respond to one follow-up question, which was "what options were available 
months ago?"  My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2) 
allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the 
siting process for new supplies.

Subject: Response Statement to PG&E's Ch. 11 Filing

It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing.

Please keep this under wraps.  We do not want to circulate this beyond the 
folks listed on this email.  Please let me know any concerns.   As we have 
known for several weeks, the report is not as explicit as we would want, but 
the White House , Vice President, and DOE have repeatedly but verbally 
assured us that they are making clear to FERC (via Pat Wood) exactly what 
this means.

Subject: RE: EFET Meeting with the CREG/Union Miniere feedback

 Ross, Paul

We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday.  
Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium 
went down very badly in the government.  Febeliec got a letter back saying 
that the govt was "disappointed and unhappy" with the letter, noting that the 
govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU, the finances of the 
communes (whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with 
Electrabel's extraction of revenues from captive customers) and something 
along the lines of "preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity 
supply".  Furthermore, there are suggestions of veiled threats (not from the 
government directly, but from those working closely with govt) of 
"retribution" ( taxes/environmental burdens) -presumably if Febeliec don't 
lay off.  Also confirmed Bruno's CREG feedback that border issues are not a 
priority.

UM however is going to persist.  Senior management (Marcel Goetstouwers, VP 
of Purchasing & Transportation) wants us to go back next week and present to 
him why exactly we can't commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next 
year and what it takes for us to be able to do so.  He intends to use this 
material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister.  We have of course been 
explaining all along the difficulties, but it has taken their recent Belgian 
tender (in response to which they received no offers apart from their 
Electrabel offer plus our OTM option) for him to take the issues seriously.  
UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission, which they may 
actually do now (possibly).  

Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their 
visit to the Minister.

Against this background, the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously 
symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt.  EFET Belgium needs to take 
this into account in moving forward. (Bruno - why not get some feedback 
directly, and independently, from Febeliec - and see if it confirms or not 
UM's report.)

On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid, I will take this forward 
with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday.  Following the recent 
pressure/letters from us on the issue to CPTE, they had indicated ARP trading 
on the grid would be in place by 1 July but this has since slipped to Sep or 
Oct, and of course, there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway (a promised 
press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of 
the nomination of the TS0, expected 21 July).  It will be interesting to see 
if Electrabel still give us a price, since there have been CPTE/Electrabel 
discussions on the matter since we raised it.

Just to clarify, we can buy from Electrabel in Belgium, but are told we can 
not SELL to them in Belgium.  Perhaps an even more crazy situation!

BTW, we intend to challenge this by doing a deal and just submitting a

market?  How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency?

As a simple example, we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to 
wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL (et vv) but refuses to allow us to 
buy from or sell to Electrabel - with significant implications for the Dutch 
as well as Belgium markets, given Electrabel's strong position in both 
markets.  In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN and/or COMP 
should take more interest.......but probably only if prodded by the Dutch to 
conisder it more of a priority (and pigs might fly on that one?)?

Obviously position of TREN key on this - what hot buttons can we press 
(assuming Dutch do nothing)?  Is there action that could be taken or 
threatened against Electrabel (although this would obviously need to be 
justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like).  Is the 
reported Electrabel/Distrigas "concert" another angle to raise with 
TREM/COMP?  Could CPTE be fined?

Regards,

Ross

Subject: EFET Meeting with the CREG - Elect. and Gas

The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not 
surprising. We met Christine VANDERVEEREN - President and Department for 
dispute settlement, Thomas LEKANE - Director of the technical operation of 
the electricity market,  Jean-Paul PINON - Director of the technical 
operation of the gas market, and Fran?ois POSSEMIERS - Director of gas price 
control. The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy, 
Mr. LEKANE was very defensive (and did not seem to understand the issues i.e. 
did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks), M. PINON was the only 
one that seemed pro-active, open and wiling to listen to market participants, 
and Mr. POSSEMIERS did not say anything. 

Electricity

We presented the situation - no access to market/transit, quasi monopoly 
situation at the detriment to consumers,  no wholesale and retail market, no 
wholesale trading allowed. We insisted that in the short -term, capacity 
should be available on a UIOLI bases, block exchanges should be put in place 
ASAP. They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented 
in the short run. In particular, at the end of the meeting M. Vanderverren 
told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for 
competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market 
issues, and not border issues, to insure the transposition of the directive 
to fend off the Commission's latest  infringement action. 
  
The CREG is still operating under the "we have no power" mode. The tension 
between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated. The 
CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministry's power, they 
are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on 
proposed legislation.   The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to 
impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO. They 
also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than 
draft decrees and certain "indicative plans" that are envisage (see below). 

Status of TSO designation:
The TSO should be nominated on 21/7. All important decrees will be passed by 
the 20/7. This includes the grid code, tariff related decrees (need 
precisions), and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries 
(including suppliers and traders).  Regarding this issue, the CREG is against 
additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable (due to political 
will), and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree 
is available (with the condition that there will be very little time to 
provide for comments)        

Grid Code
According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet, the grid 
code should be issued by the end of June at the latest. They are still 
considering including a concentration process on specific issues. EFET will 
be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly.   

Border capacity allocation:
It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one 
that would implement auctions by 2002 (this what they consider to be the 
short term solution). In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred 
solution would be market splitting. They are not considering any type on 
UIOLI procedure in the immediate (despite our stressing that this should be 
easily implementable).

Trading Arrangements:
We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures. It 
seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments 
on  the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had 
to offer comments to the ministry. (Again in previous conversation with the 
energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly 
looking to ask for a formal consultation process)

Envisaged Consultation:
Electric: 
 Decree on licences,
 Projected demand for the next ten years - projected imports, exports and 
transits - need for production
Gas: 
 Projected demand for the next ten years - the need for flexibility, 
competition, ....
 New Grid Code: Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the 
new law.  

Next steps:
EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks. Is 
Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month.
Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet (next issue to 
discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation, trading arrangements). June 6 Meeting 
with DGTREN to expose barriers in BE market. (At the end of the CREG meeting 
I asked that they meet with Enron and the responded that they did not have 
the time)

Stephen Littlechild used to be the UK electricity regulator. Paul and I have 
inherited a consultancy agreement Mark Schroeder signed up with him two 
months ago. He is going to do an EU-wide power markets competition review for 
me to use up some contracted hours. He has sent me the attachments below in 
preparation for the briefings on that review. You may find the second and 
third items, both of which make some reference to California, of interest.

Dear Peter
?
Thank you for the helpful telephone conversation  just now. I am attaching as 
promised the two recent papers and the slides for my  recent UBSW talk.? Any 
comments on the latter would be particularly helpful  in drafting the 
European paper we discussed. I look forward to receiving the  internal papers 
you spoke of.
?
Monday afternoon on May 21 looks fine at present  and I will pencil it in 
while you explore meetings with others.
?
With best wishes
Stephen

This is potentially important.  If FERC were to grant Puget's request to 
dismiss and withdraw its complaint, it could undercut the suggestion made to 
Ray A. by a FERC staffer at a recent meeting that FERC could potentially 
order WSCC refunds prior to the July 2, 2001 refund effective date 
established in the June 19 Order (which FERC could attempt to do by revising 
its previous dismissal of Puget's complaint on rehearing, which is pending.)

My guess is that FERC will not wish to give up the leverage that it has on 
this front, and thus will sit on Puget's motion to withdrawal for the time 
being while the settlement efforts are ongoing.

Attached is Puget's 06/22/2001Motion to dismiss & notice of withdrawal of 
pleadings of Puget Sound Energy, Inc re all jurisdictional sellers of energy 
and/or capacity at wholesale into electric energy and/or capacity markets in 
the Pacific Northwest etc, EL01-10.

FERC acceptance of this withdrawal would resolve the concern about the 
potential for an earlier refund effective date for prices charged in the WSCC.

Rick,

As requested in Peter's note regarding Steve's upcoming presentation at the 
Eurelectric Annual Meeting, I have pulled four articles from our German press 
archives on "California".   We only archive Enron mentions, so the file was 
limited to the four above, only.   The original articles were obviously in 
German, but what I have provided are simply our Agency's summary of the 
article's key points in English.

I hope this proves useful.  Please let me know if there is anything else we 
can provide.

Thanks,
Fiona

Rick / Maureen,


Here are  additional two papers on California which could be of interest. The 
first one has been drafted by EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders, 
which we are founding members of and where Peter is the Chairman of 
Electricity Working Group). The second has been prepared by the Electricity 
Association in the UK.

IBEW Statement on PG&E Bankruptcy

PR Newswire
04/06/01, 5:02p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to the bankruptcy 
announcement made by Pacific Gas and Electric, Edwin D. Hill, International 
President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), 
issued the following statement. 

"Pacific Gas and Electric's filing for bankruptcy could make a dire situation 
in California even worse. On behalf of the 13,500 IBEW Local Union 1245 
members employed by PG&E and the public they serve, we believe it is 
imperative that constructive action be taken now.

"Specifically, we call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to 
stop dragging its feet and impose price controls on the wholesale electricity 
market in California. It is obvious that price gouging by wholesale suppliers 
has bled dry the investor-owned utilities and precipitated this crisis. The 
state has purchased power in an effort to prop up the system, but it too has 
paid the same inflated prices. This only threatens California's budget 
surplus and places an unfair burden on taxpayers while doing nothing to 
address the root of the problem.

"We also believe that it is time for government and industry to work together 
to jump start projects to improve the interconnected transmission grid in the 
Western states so that power can be quickly and efficiently moved to where it 
is needed. Prompt action on such projects could have helped alleviate the 
current problems, and they should commence with all due speed.

"Another factor that has driven the crisis is the lack of adequate generation 
facilities to power the growth of California and other Western states. We 
urge the Western Governors Association to take the lead in helping to chart a 
course that will bring more facilities on line and provide short and long 
term solutions to these difficulties.

"Even though we have been assured that PG&E employees will still be paid, and 
we know that their pensions are protected by law, we will fight to ensure 
that our collective bargaining rights are honored during this process. We 
will work with our Local Union 1245, utility management, Governor Davis and 
all other parties to restore sanity and reliability to California's gas and 
electricity systems."

CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK) 
today issued the following statement: 

We regret that the collective actions to mitigate Pacific Gas & Electric's 
(PG&E) financial crisis were unsuccessful in keeping it from filing for 
Chapter 11 reorganization. However, the Chapter 11 filing provides a defined 
process to collect our past receivables and keep PG&E in business going 
forward.

Duke Energy had taken a number of aggressive steps to limit its financial 
exposure to uncertainties in California's energy market, including the 
potential bankruptcy of the state's investor-owned utilities. The company has 
also sold a significant portion of its energy output from its California 
plants through fixed-price, forward contracts to creditworthy entities.

Duke Energy continues to operate its power plants in California efficiently 
and effectively to supply the state's energy needs. The company is working 
with federal and state officials and members of the state legislature to help 
California solve its electricity problems.

Duke Energy, a diversified multinational energy company, creates value for 
customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and 
expertise. Duke Energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and 
electric supply, delivery and trading businesses -- generating revenues of

Reliant Energy Says Bankruptcy Action By Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Not 
Unexpected

PR Newswire
04/06/01, 4:11p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)



HOUSTON, April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI) said today that 
the bankruptcy filing announced by Pacific Gas and Electric Company was not 
an unexpected occurrence and does not increase Reliant Energy's financial 
exposure.

Steve Letbetter, Reliant Energy chairman, president, and chief executive 
officer, said Reliant Energy planned for such a possibility during the fourth 
quarter 2000 and continues to do so.

"Our exposure to financial risk as a result of Pacific Gas and Electric's 
action is not expected to increase," Letbetter said. "This development does 
not impact the level of first quarter results we have previously anticipated. 
We established a $39 million reserve in the fourth quarter of 2000, and we 
will continue to reserve appropriate funds."

According to Letbetter, bankruptcy is one of the mechanisms that will get 
outstanding receivables paid and can be a part of an overall, constructive 
solution to California's energy crisis.

"Despite this bankruptcy action, Reliant Energy will continue to work with 
the state to ensure our generating plants are available to serve California's 
electricity needs," Letbetter said. "We remain committed to helping find a 
long-term solution to California's energy crisis."

Reliant Energy plans to release its earnings on Monday, April 16.

Reliant Energy, based in Houston, Texas, is an international energy services 
and energy delivery company with approximately $29 billion in annual revenue 
and assets totaling more than $32 billion. The company has more than 23,000 
megawatts of power generation in operation in the U.S. and is one of only 
three companies to rank among both the five largest power marketers and the 
five largest natural gas marketers in the nation. The company also has 
wholesale trading and marketing operations and more than 3,400 megawatts of 
power generation in Western Europe. Reliant Energy's retail marketing and 
distribution operations serve nearly four million electricity and natural gas 
customers in the U.S., and its Internet infrastructure and communications 
company serves business customers in Texas.

Sempra Energy And SDG&E Reaffirm Strong Financial Position in Response to 
PG&E Bankruptcy

Business Wire
04/06/01, 4:00p
(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Sempra Energy and San Diego Gas & 
Electric (SDG&E) officials took the opportunity of today's Chapter 11 
bankruptcy announcement by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to reaffirm their 
companies' strong financial position and the significant regulatory and 
legislative differences between SDG&E and PG&E.

"We want to reassure our customers and shareholders that Sempra Energy and 
SDG&E remain very strong and financially viable companies," said Stephen L. 
Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy, the 
parent company of SDG&E. "SDG&E is continuing its record of providing safe 
and reliable gas and electric service for our 1.2 million customers today, 
tomorrow and for years to come. There are several significant financial, 
legislative and regulatory differences that distinguish Sempra Energy and 
SDG&E from PG&E."

SDG&E is covered under Assembly Bill 265, a law signed by the Governor last 
September which guaranteed that SDG&E will be able to collect the difference 
between the capped price of electricity and the wholesale cost of power, 
providing the power was prudently purchased. PG&E is not covered by AB 265 
and that guarantee. At the end of February, the under-collection in the 
balancing account was $681 million. Since the state's power procurement 
agency, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), has been 
purchasing power for SDG&E, the growth of the company's balancing account has 
slowed significantly.

Unlike PG&E, SDG&E has been able to pay its wholesale electric bills to the 
DWR, the California Independent System Operator, the California Power 
Exchange and Qualifying Facilities that cogenerate power for the utility. 
Additionally, the Sempra Energy companies have no significant credit exposure 
to PG&E.

"Sempra Energy and SDG&E have long advocated that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission institute temporary regional wholesale price caps to 
help stem the financial problems such as those experienced by PG&E," Baum 
added. "We are also committed to promoting and instituting comprehensive 
energy conservation programs for all customers to help control bills and 
decrease the chances of rotating outages this summer."

Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500 energy 
services holding company with 12,000 employees and annual revenues of $5.4 
billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries -- SoCalGas, SDG&E, Sempra 
Energy Solutions, Sempra Energy Trading, Sempra Energy International, Sempra 
Energy Resources, Sempra Communications and Sempra Energy Financial -- Sempra 
Energy serves more than 9 million customers in the United States, Europe, 
Canada, Mexico and South America.

Fitch Cuts Pacific Gas and Electric, So Cal Edison Ratings

Business Wire
04/06/01, 4:57p
(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Fitch has lowered its ratings for 
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pac Gas) senior secured and preferred 
securities into the default category based on the utility's voluntary filing

California Edison's (So Cal Ed) likelihood of accomplishing a sale of its 
transmission assets to the State of California. Consequently, Fitch has 
lowered So Cal Ed's senior secured debt rating and changed the Ratings Watch 
to Negative from Evolving. The Ratings Watch status of Edison International, 
the parent of So Cal Ed, is also changed to Negative from Evolving. The new 
ratings are:

Pacific Gas and Electric Company


   First Mortgage Bonds to `DDD' from `B-`;
   Preferred Securities to `D' from `C';
   Commercial Paper `D' Unchanged;
   Rating Watch Not applicable Negative.

Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's 
"at least one source-to-sink reservation" proposal.

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on 
transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was 
too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point 
was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that "at least one" reservation on a 
tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule 
would be denied for improper use.

Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with 
me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the 
Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two 
conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually 
pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was 
unacceptable.  

The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:

 1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.
 2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the 
transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will 
be approved
 3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the 
transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the 
transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will 
be denied

While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great 
deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same 
time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us 
to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without 
a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility 
within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under 
the IRCA.  

This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy 
S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to 
meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are 
necessary.

As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will 
allow for "partial" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate 
proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to 
accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability 
risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is 
tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much 
more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra 
providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change. 

A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4, 
Discussion item "Confusing POR/POD Naming," Discussion Item "MISO Proposal  
...time of scheduling," and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to 
those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.

Take a look at attachment below for guidance in any discussion with Ristori 
next Wednesday re Bush energy policy statement and comparative aspects of EC 
green paper on sec. of supply. To remind you of what Loyola said on CNN 
yesterday:
 - Agrees with need to re-evaluate role of nuclear plus future investment in 
it .
 - Disagrees with weight given to supply side and indigenous sources, 
compared with demand side and fuel diversity (also from external sources?)
 - Disagrees with exclusion of climate change considerations.

E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and
public utility law.

July 2, 2001

Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services

 Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate
authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary
services.  See Order No. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as stating: "The fact that we have authorized a utility to
sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized
the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates."  Accordingly,
an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with
regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.

 In markets that are currently administered by independent system
operators ("ISOs") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM"), the New
York ISO ("NYISO"), ISO-New England ("ISO-NE"), and the California ISO
("Cal-ISO") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general
market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to
the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary
services.  See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the
NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ? 61,102
(1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into
the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec. Co., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,039 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into PJM);
PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 91 FERC ? 61,021 (2000) (same); see also New
England Power Pool, 85 FERC ? 61,379 (1998); Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,062 (1999); Connectiv Energy Supply Inc., 91
FERC ? 61,076 (2000); AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C., et al., 83 FERC ? 61,358,
order on reh'g and clarification, 85 FERC ? 61,123 (1998), order on reh'g
and clarification, 87 FERC ? 61,208, order on reh'g, 88 FERC ? 61,096
(1999), order on reh'g and clarification, 90 FERC ? 61,036 (2000).

As a general proposition, companies that have sought authority to sell
ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket
authorization for sales of ancillary services.  Many companies have added
that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary
services and geographic markets, as the FERC may specify and authorize in
the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously
authorized to sell energy and/or capacity at market-based rates.  See Edison
Mission Mktg. and Trading, Docket No. ER99-2434-000 (unpublished delegated
letter order issued May 7, 1999).

 The authority to make sales of ancillary services at market-based
rates is not, merely, limited to only those markets were established by the
FERC with operating ISOs.  The criteria for seeking such authority in
non-ISO markets is found in the Avista case.  See Avista Corp., 87 FERC -
61,223, reh'g granted, 89 FERC - 61,136 (1999) ("Avista").  The problem
associated with obtaining market-based rates for ancillary services in
non-ISO markets has centered on the difficulty (or impossibility) of
obtaining estimates of other suppliers' abilities to supply ancillary
services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the
entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant
markets for ancillary services.  However, in the Avista case, the FERC
authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response, Energy
Imbalance, Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service, and Operating
Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service at market-based rates in non-ISO
markets with certain conditions.

 The Avista conditions require the Company to consider: (1) the
establishment of an internet site that provides information on, and
conducts, ancillary services transactions; (2) the posting on the internet
site of the offering prices of all available services; and (3) the ability
of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the
site.  Moreover, the entity must file with the FERC one year after the
internet site is operational, and at least three years thereafter, a report
describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets.  The
entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at market-based rates
to:  (i) regional transmission organizations ("RTOs") such as an ISO or
transco, i.e., where the RTO has no ability to self-supply ancillary
services but instead depends on third parties; (ii) a traditional franchised
public utility affiliated with the entity, or sales where the underlying
transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the
entity; or (iii) a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to
satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer
ancillary services to its own customers.  Id. at 61,833, note 12.

 The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary
services at market-based rates must be included in the market-based rate
schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority
as discussed above.  For entities which have already obtained general
market-based rate authority, an amendment could be filed in their underlying
market-based rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell
ancillary services at market-based rates consistent with the referenced FERC
precedent.

The break up is imminent. And the Norwegian government is in the course of 
determining how its corresponding new offshore pipeline TPA regime will be 
structured. I have set up a meeting with Maria Foster, Steve Asplin and Rudi 
Dautel, at  5 in London on Tuesday to explore opportunities this could bring 
for us.

FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders:

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous 
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) 
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in 
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically 
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of 
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order 
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load 
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a 
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to 
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator 
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all 
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and 
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to 
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may 
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in 
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.  
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.  
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some 
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing 
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides 
that "Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long 
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by 
Transmission Provider up to that point."  FPL's unfiled procedures allow 
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers 
includes similar procedures.  

What are "material changes" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's 
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) 
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the 
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions 
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more 
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) 
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the 
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, 
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can 
result in loss of queue spot.  

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.

Below is a concept to perhaps solve the problem confronting EES and the Ohio 
market.  It is a work in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are 
welcomed.

Problem - There is uncertainty about EES's ability to pursue what had been 
perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power (AEP) and 
Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves.  These changes 
reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns 
regarding load following and imbalances.

Proposed Solution - Negotiate a power swap with AEP and/or Cinergy.

How the Proposal Works - Under the proposal,  EESI would enter into a 
contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit, 
thereby offering savings to the customer.  EESI would then enter into a 
contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it 
currently does (similar to the market support generation concept).  EESI 
could agree to pay AEP a modest sum (a few mils/kwh, for example) as an 
incentive to do the deal.   EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to 
procure on- peak and off- peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to 
or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer, minus a percentage 
or millage which would be EESI's profit on the deal.  ENA would contract with 
AEP to provide the on-peak and off-peak power in the same quantities as AEP 
is providing to EESI  customers.

The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO 
adequately addresses load following, whichever comes first. The amount of the 
capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up 
to the amound required to get AEP to its 20%.   

Why AEP Might Consider the Deal - Currently, there is no customer switching 
in the AEP service territory.  Under SB 3, if less than 20% of the customers 
switch by the end of 2003, then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to 
address why.  The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit, 
which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek.  If no switching 
continues to be the issue, the Commission could take action sooner.  Also, 
under SB 3, if 20% of customers switch, anytime after mid-2003, any party, 
including the utility, can petition the Commission to go to market based 
rates and end the market development (transition) period.  It is my belief 
that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as 
possible for two reasons.  First, they have very little stranded generation 
assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in 2003.  Their 
Regulatory Asset Charge (which is where all there stranded costs really are) 
is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the 
Market Development Period ends.  The most compelling reason for AEP to 
consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to 
take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably 
like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low 
rates.  This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to 
sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return.  Finally, the swap 
leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder, EESI could add to the 
deal is just extra profit for them.

Benefits to EESI - EESI gets to do its deals, make a profit and get a strong 
foothold in the Ohio market.  EESI also gets a competitive edge over other 
marketers by securing physical capability.  Third, by moving AEP more quickly 
to market- based rates, this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron 
thrives on.  Fourth, once AEP goes to market-based rates they are required to 
conduct a competitive bid for default service.  This could potentially 
accelerate by as much as two and  a half years, the opportuntity for an EESI 
play as the default service provider.

Benefit to ENA - This provides ENA a large, longterm wholesale transaction. 
ENA's profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA (as described 
above) and the price at which it procures the power. 

Benefit to Customers - The customers get the benefit of lower rates and 
savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and 
the price negotiated with EESI.  They are indifferent as to the source of the 
power.

Next Steps - Assuming this looks like an idea that can work, I would set up a 
lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski, Senior VP who negotiated the settlements 
to explore this concept with him.  Rich is very practical and very 
bottom-line oriented.  If he thinks this is good for AEP, he might be willing 
to carry the water internally on this.  Judging from several years of 
negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere, I think there is a reasonable 
chance he would be receptive.   I could also arrange a similar meeting with 
Jim Gainer, VP, legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements.  I have a good 
relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward.  If 
he thinks this has merit, he will take it up with Jim Turner, president of 
Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, who I also have a good relationship 
with, although not as close.

Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.
Thank you,
Janine

Eric and Tim -- This is a note to bring you up to date on my attempts to 
resolve the ISU/IP issue.  As you are aware, IP has threatened to impose a 
retroactive standby charge to Illinois State University, our customers, if it 
uses its on site generation for peak shaving purposes this summer.  When ISU 
was an IP customer, the utility did not impose such charges, but noe that 
they have lost their PPO and have reverted to SC21 this was made an issue.

I spoke with Kathy Patton last week and told her the situation.  She 
responded to me today and indicated that a final answer cannot be given until 
early next week because the VP over major accounts is out of the office.  She 
indicated that her peole said that ISU never used on-site generation for peak 
shaving purposesand instead used them only for back-up, hence no standby 
service was required previously.  I told her that that was not accurate and 
that this is a new and unwarranted change in requirements that is not 
supported by IP's tariffs.  I also informed her that the units are 
electrically isolated from IP's system through a make-and-break switch system 
and could obviously not be served by two power sources. Further, since ISU 
has about 25 of these small units scattered around its campus in Normal, 
Illinois, the likelihood that a significant percentage of these units would 
fail and require IP to standby is virtually zero.  I also told her that she 
was in the middle of this and that I did not believe that she was getting the 
full story from her people but that I was not interested in playing a blame 
game, but rather wish to avoid an unnecessary confrontation that serves 
nobody.  She agreed and indicated that she would call me Tuesday, July 3 and 
give me IP's position.  I have positioned this as a misunderstanding on the 
part of IP's account representative.

Rick, here's the contact information.  We received a call this morning from 
our local MO political consultant Cagle that Ameren is applying extreme 
political pressure to move the bill.  It would be best for Ken to call Kinder 
on Friday, when Kinder is in his office in Cape Girardeau.  Number there is 
573-335-6611.

Subject: Missouri genco bill issues and a proposed strategy

(from Barbara and Kerry)

Ameren UE has been successful in developing political support for a bill that 
would permit each Missouri IOU to transfer its generation assets to a genco 
at net book value.  The genco would enter into a five-year term purchased 
power arrangement with the utility, with subsequent minimum three-year term 
renewals.  Each utility transferring its generation assets would be required 
to establish a "dedicated supply" tariff for large customers, who could elect 
to obtain energy from alternative suppliers in a buy-through arrangement.  
Alternative suppliers would be required to sell dedicated supply to the 
utility in a wholesale transaction; the utility would transport the power to 
the large customers, who, from an operational perspective, remain native load 
customers of the utility.  

The Senate Commerce and Environment Committee has passed the bill, which will 
be considered by the Senate sometime in the next several weeks.  If the 
Senate passes the bill, the debate will resume in the House.  Legislators are 
interested in moving the bill because they believe it will improve 
reliability of supply in Missouri.  Ameren UE has postponed building 
generation, and will require an additional 800 MW for next summer.  In the 
wake of the California situation, the legislative interest is not in 
providing a competitive discipline to the marketplace.  Ameren has promoted a 
genco structure as necessary for mitigating the investment community's 
concern over regulatory risk associated with building new generation 
facilities under traditional rate of return regulation.

There are a number of problems with the bill. From a retail aspect, it will 
be difficult if not impossible to compete for large customers, who will be 
able to procure power from the utility at FERC established cost-based rates 
that are currently below market.  In its present form the bill does not 
include meaningful code of conduct provisions, and it permits the utility to 
enter into billing and metering "experiments" in which customers can be 
aggregated and sold utility services at unregulated rates.  Although the bill 
requires that rates for utilities establishing gencos must be reestablished 
in rate cases within twelve months prior to  the transfer of generation 
assets, it is unclear the extent to which rates will be unbundled.  Finally, 
alternative generation suppliers and their customers would be subject to 
balancing charges, which render physical transactions untenable at this time.

 From the wholesale perspective, the bill is unacceptable because incremental 
resources required to serve Missouri retail load are not required to be 
competitively procured.  An earlier version of the bill would have permitted 
competitive procurement of additional generation sources at the utility's 
discretion, but was removed at the request of the Missouri PSC staff, who are 
sensitive to the legislature's focus on the issue of reliability.

The bill is sponsored by President Pro-Tem Peter Kinder, who in the past 
introduced comprehensive legislation that required competitive procurement 
for customers not choosing alternative supply sources.  Although Senator 
Kinder told Barbara and Roy Cagle that he would support passage of a bill 
this year, he does not appear to be taking an active interest in the details 
of the legislation.

Senator Kinder belonged to the same fraternity at the University of Missouri 
as Ken Lay, though they didn't attend college together.  Senator Kinder has 
voiced his admiration of Ken Lay, and met him at the Republican Convention 
this year.  It might be possible to persuade Senator Kinder to improve the 
bill, if Ken Lay were to communicate personally with him.

We recommend that Senator Kinder be persuaded to alter the bill to require 
competitive procurement for incremental generation resources.  On the basis 
of our discussions with EES and ENA, it appears that taking steps to address 
retail market structure problems will not put us in a position to compete 
effectively for large customers in the short and mid term.       

Barbara and I will prepare briefing materials for Ken Lay, if you wish to 
proceed in this fashion.  Please advise.

***************************************************************
AS COMMERCE COMMITTEE VOTE NEARS ON HR 1542,
BELLS SPAR WITH CLECs, IXCs OVER `SUBSTITUTE'

Bell company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband
Deployment Act, HR 1542, will clear the House Energy and Commerce
Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow.  Opponents, however,
hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen
Congress's enthusiasm for broadband "relief" legislation.

"It looks like it will pass," U.S. Telecom Association interim
President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S. Lytle told TR today
after a press briefing to review the legislation.  "It should get
somewhere in the mid to high 30s," he said, referring to the
number of members on the 57-person panel that USTA predicts will
vote for the bill at tomorrow's markup session.  The bill cleared
the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month
by a 19-14 vote (TR, April 30).

Meanwhile, a "substitute" version of HR 1542 that began
circulating late last night (Monday) has sparked another round of
bickering between Bell company interests and members of the
competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier
industries.  The substitute, released by Commerce Committee
Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.), incorporates the four
amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee.  It
also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs' resale of
advanced services and "line sharing" and new definitions for
"Internet backbone services" and "Internet access service."

H. Russell Frisby Jr., president of the Competitive
Telecommunications Association, said the new provisions would
make the legislation "go from bad to worse under the guise of
compromise."  The new definition of "Internet backbone services"
is too broad, he said, as it would include too many services in a
deregulated regime.

Mr. Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would
preserve CLECs' ability to implement line sharing.  The FCC's
line-sharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the
high-frequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to
provide voice services over the lower-frequency portion.  But Mr.
Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders
that "put the meat on the bones" of the line-sharing mandates.

According to a copy of the substitute draft, the FCC's rules on
line sharing would remain intact, but ILECs wouldn't be required
to provide access to the high-frequency portion of the loop at
the remote terminal -- a provision that another critic agrees
would "undercut" the Commission's line-sharing rules.  "If line
sharing is not allowed through remote terminals, then 35% of
consumers will be denied residential broadband competition
because of this bill," the CLEC source said.

That claim, however, was disputed by Thomas J. Tauke, senior vice
president-public policy and external affairs for Verizon
Communications, Inc.  Speaking with reporters at the USTA press
briefing, Mr. Tauke said the bill's new line-sharing language
would have a "minimal effect" on CLECs in Verizon's service
territory because "very few of them use" line sharing.  For
Verizon, the substitute language would eliminate the "economic
and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have
fiber in the local loop," he said.

Rep. Tauzin's substitute bill also has new language requiring
ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates
for as many as three years after enactment of the bill.  The
original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate
exemption from resale obligations.

Committee staffers were said to be working out last-minute
details on another amendment that's expected to be offered
tomorrow by Reps. Cliff Stearns (R., Fla.), Bobby L. Rush (D.,
Ill.), and Thomas C. Sawyer (D., Ohio).  According to sources,
the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief.  But
it would require ILECs to make about 70% of their central offices
DSL (digital subscriber line)-ready by a date certain, most
likely within three years of enactment.

Mr. Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout
requirements, saying "it's good public policy not to have a
buildout provision in this legislation."  The government should
mandate buildout requirements "only when the market isn't
working," he said.

Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the
telecom subcommittee's review are being teed up for tomorrow,
including several from Rep. Tom Davis III (R., Va.) and one from
Rep. Anna Eshoo (D., Calif.) to require Bell companies to
continue filing service-quality and accounting reports at the
FCC.  Rep. Tauzin has said he would address FCC "enforcement"
issues at tomorrow's markup session, but he may not tackle those
issues through legislation.

Asked by TR whether Rep. Tauzin planned to offer an FCC
enforcement amendment to HR 1542, spokesman Ken Johnson said
today, "I can only confirm that Reps. Tauzin and [Rep. Fred Upton
(R., Mich.)] will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the
House floor to substantially beef up the FCC's enforcement"
tools.


***************************************************************
JUDGE:  CLECs DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTS-OF-WAY

A federal district judge in Lincoln, Neb., has ruled that
competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) aren't required to
give incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) access to their
poles, ducts, and rights-of-way.  Judge Richard G. Kopf made the
determination in "AT&T Communications of the Midwest, Inc., v. U
S WEST Communications, Inc., et al." (case no. 4:97CV3286).

AT&T brought the lawsuit in 1997, seeking to overturn the
Nebraska Public Service Commission's approval of an
interconnection agreement.  That agreement required AT&T to give
U S WEST (now Qwest Corp.) "reciprocal access" to poles, ducts,
and rights-of-way.  Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by
judicial challenges to the FCC's landmark 1996 order on carrier
interconnection.

Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to
handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of
1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Section
251 of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers
(LECs) -- whether ILECs or CLECs -- to grant access to their
rights-of-way, the judge said.  But section 224 seems to require
that all LECs grant access only to competitive, not incumbent,
local exchange carriers, he said.

The FCC had based its regulations on section 224, and most
federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation,
Judge Kopf said.  But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit (San Francisco) has said it "doubts the soundness of the
FCC's interpretation of section 251."

Judge Kopf, however, followed the other district courts and
deferred to the FCC's interpretation.  He concluded that "in
light of the Act's purpose, [which is] to promote competition,. .
.the FCC's interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the
facilities or rights-of-way of a LEC or any utility under either
section 225 of section 251 is based on a permissible construction
of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of
the Act."

Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocal-access portion of the
companies' interconnection agreement violated the Act and the
FCC's rules.  He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of
the agreement.


***************************************************************
FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM

The FCC has proposed "streamlining and simplifying" the way it
collects Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions.  The
proposals, which include limiting how carriers recover
contributions from their customers and using a flat-rate
assessment, are aimed at dealing with recent changes and
developing trends in the industry.

The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce
the "lag time" between accrual of revenues and payment of
contributions based on those revenues (TR, March 19).  At that
time, it said it soon would consider "more fundamental modifica-
tions" to the USF contribution mechanism.  The USF supports
affordable service in "high-cost" areas and discounted service
for low-income customers, schools, libraries, and rural health
care providers.

USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of
carriers' interstate and international end-user telecom service
revenues.  The percentage is based on revenues as of six months
before the contributions are collected.  The FCC allows carriers
to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution
costs from their customers.

In a statement today, the FCC said the following industry trends
affect USF contributions:  (1) the entrance of new companies --
such as the Bells -- into certain long distance markets, (2)
growth in the wireless telecom sector, to the extent that
wireless carriers' interstate revenues may exceed the FCC's
interim "safe harbor" threshold for contributions, and (3)
increased bundling of services, making it difficult to
distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues.

The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers
to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues, rather
than a percentage of their billed revenues, to the USF.  It wants
to know whether it should assess contributions based on current
or projected revenues.

The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment,
such as a fixed per-line charge; if it should require that
carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution
recovery charges; and whether those charges should be limited to
the amount of the contribution assessment.


***************************************************************
FCC's WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON `E911'
COSTS

The FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with
public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of
the financial burden for installing Phase I "enhanced 911" (E911)
systems.

In a May 7 letter to the King County (Wash.) E911 Program, bureau
Chief Thomas J. Sugrue clarified that the 911 selective router
maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper
demarcation point for allocating E911 implementation costs
between wireless carriers and public safety answering points
(PSAPs).

The bureau's determination supports the view held by PSAPs.=20
Carriers, on the other hand, had maintained that PSAPs should be
responsible for E911 network components or upgrades beginning at
carriers' switches.  The bureau sought comments on the issue last
year in response to King County's request for a clarification of
the FCC's position (TR, Aug. 21 and Sept. 25, 2000).

In the letter, Mr. Sugrue stressed that the agency "continues to
favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and
efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations
for implementing Phase I."  But PSAPs still will have to bear
some costs, he said, including upgrades to the 911 selective
router, trunking equipment, and other hardware and software.


***************************************************************
STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE
PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS

Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a
small percentage of vehicle accidents, according to an analysis
of accident data released today.  The University of North
Carolina's Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for
the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Crashworthiness
Data System.

The data were collected from 1995 to 1999 on 32,303 vehicles
involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from
the scene.  Results were weighted to calculate national
estimates.

In crashes where driver distraction was a factor, 29.4% of the
time that distraction was something outside the driver's vehicle,
the study found.  Drivers' attempts to adjust car radios was a
factor in 11.4% of collisions involving driver distraction, and
passengers were a factor in 10.9% of those crashes, the study
said.

Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver
distractions.  Use of wireless phones preceded 1.5% of crashes
where driver distraction was a factor, the study said.  The
margin of error for each category varied from 0.4% to 7.2%; for
mobile phone use, it was 0.9%.

Jane Stutts, manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center
and the study's author, told TR that the mobile phone results
were "surprising just because people assume that cell phones
cause a lot of crashes."  But she stressed that many drivers may
be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a
phone.  "They may try to hide it," she said.  The estimates for
mobile phone use were based on only 42 reported cases.

Ms. Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as
"unknown" for almost 36% of the cases studied.  She said this
fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident
data.


***************************************************************
CABLEVISION WON'T HELP AT&T SELL $2B CABLEVISION STAKE

Cablevision Systems Corp. executives today said they don't intend
to help AT&T Corp. sell $2 billion in Cablevision shares.  AT&T
had asked Cablevision, a cable TV system operator based in
Bethpage, N.Y., to register the 30 million shares with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing for a public sale
(TR, April 16).

"Cablevision has notified AT&T that we will not proceed at this
time with the registration of their shares" of Cablevision common
stock, said William Bell, Cablevision's vice chairman.  Instead,
Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise
funds to improve its cable TV networks, he said during a
conference call with investors and analysts.

Cablevision's decision may complicate AT&T's efforts to sell the
shares, which it inherited in the 1999 takeover of Tele-
Communications, Inc.  AT&T wants to sell the stake to raise funds
for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings.  The FCC's
rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being
vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.  But AT&T has
been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation
for the enactment of new rules.

AT&T still can sell the Cablevision shares, Mr. Bell said.  AT&T
has "piggyback" registration rights that entitle it, under
certain conditions, to add its shares to Cablevision's public
stock offerings, according to SEC documents.  "AT&T may or may
not be able to exercise some piggyback rights," Mr. Bell said.=20
"It really will depend on market conditions and what
Cablevision's needs are."


***************************************************************
FCC SEEKS EXTRA $4M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM

The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an
additional $4 million for its fiscal year 2002 budget.  The funds
would help pay for a new "Excellence in Engineering" training and
recruitment program.  President Bush has proposed $248 million
for the FCC for FY 2002 -- an 8% increase over the Commission's
current appropriation level (TR, April 16).

In a letter to Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.), FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell says the extra money would be used for
recruitment incentives, educational initiatives for advanced and
"non"-engineers at the FCC, and upgrading the agency's technical
equipment.

"The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the
Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that
it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as
are the entities it regulates," Mr. Powell said in the May 4
letter.

Mr. Powell's letter included draft legislation that would allow
the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical
and professional hires that are "more competitive with the
private sector."  The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner
to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the
three professional assistants they currently are allowed.

A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was "working with Mr.
Powell to submit the budget request."  Sen. Burns is chairman of
the communications subcommittee and is a member of the
Appropriations Committee.=20

nature of the violations at issue, combined with the fact that
CEI is a going concern."....

Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a Houston-based energy exploration and
production company, has agreed to make a $15,000 contribution to
the U.S. Treasury and to implement a rules-compliance program to
settle charges that it transferred control of 49 land mobile and
microwave licenses without FCC approval.  The company has signed
a consent decree with the FCC's Enforcement Bureau.  A memorandum

Another victory at FERC!

Although Enron did not file a protest in this docket, nor was a signatory t=
o=20
the joint Coral/Dynegy protest, I worked with Dynegy on forming the argumen=
ts=20
against the proposed change to OASIS (first to confirm after scheduling=20
deadline) at NERC.   Dynegy and Enron and a few others voted against the NE=
RC=20
request but lost the vote thus leading to the NERC filing.  In my opinion,=
=20
such a practice would advantage incumbent utilities and their affiliate=20
marketers who tend to buy pre-confirmed Firm service.

One of the main arguments I made at NERC and a chief reason why FERC denied=
=20
the request is cited in the order:

"Dynegy/Coral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of=20
unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accept=

transmission requests, but does not address the underlying problem caused b=
y=20
the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of=

requests for daily, firm transmission service, even when customers submit=

their requests early. "

FERC further acknowleded:
"If transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily,firm=20
transmission service on a timely basis, then customers would have adequate=
=20
time to confirm before reservations are scheduled, and the MIC's proposed=

business practice might not be needed."

This is the correct message for FERC to send back to NERC - to put the burd=

on the transmission providers to expedite requests - not penalize the=20
customers for getting OASIS requests in early.=20

     Open Access Same-time Information
       System (OASIS) and Standards of           Docket No. RM95-9-013
       Conduct


     ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR EXPERIMENTAL BUSINESS PRACTICE STANDARD

                           (Issued June 29, 2001)

          We will deny the request from the Market Interface Committee

     of the North American Electric Reliability Council (MIC) for

     expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of

     unconfirmed requests for daily, firm transmission service, for

     the reasons stated below.

     BACKGROUND

          On May 29, 2001, the MIC filed a request to modify the

     Commission's OASIS Business Practice Standards adopted in Order
             1
     No. 638,  to add a new business practice standard dealing with

     accepted daily, firm point-to-point transmission service that has

     not been confirmed and to modify a related footnote to Table 4-2

     on Reservation Timing Limits.  The MIC requests that the

     Commission implement this proposal on a mandatory, experimental

     basis for six months beginning no later than June 30, 2001.  The

     MIC further states that, within four months of the effective

     date, it will provide the Commission with an assessment of the

               1
                Open Access Same-Time Information System and Standards of
          Conduct, Order No. 638, FERC Stats. & Regs., Regulations
          Preambles 1996-2000 =0F4 31,092 (2000).







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -2-

     experiment and whether it should be revised, discontinued, or

     made permanent.

          On June 5, 2001, the Commission issued a notice of filing

     and request for comments regarding the MIC filing.  The notice

     gave a brief description of the MIC proposal and invited comments
                                2
     on or before June 11, 2001.   Comments were invited on the MIC

     proposal generally and specifically on whether Commission action

     is needed by June 30, 2001, as requested by the MIC.

          On June 11, 2001, Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. and Coral

     Power, LLC (collectively "Dynegy/Coral") jointly filed a protest

     opposing the MIC request.

     Dynegy/Coral argue that the MIC proposal should not be granted on

     an expedited basis and that it should be rejected outright.

     Dynegy/Coral's protest was the sole comment filed in response to

     the June 5, 2001 notice and request for comments.

     DISCUSSION

          We will deny the MIC s request for expedited approval of its

     proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for

     daily, firm transmission service for three reasons.  First,

     although the MIC requests expedited approval of its proposed

     experiment, the MIC s proposal presents no reason why expedited

     treatment is needed.  Moreover, although our June 5, 2001 notice

     specifically invited comment on this issue, no comments were

     filed in support of expedited treatment or giving reasons why


               2
                This shortened comment period was used to accommodate the
          MIC's request for action on or before June 30, 2001.







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -3-

     prompt action is needed.  In fact, Dynegy/Coral s protest, the

     sole comment filed, argued against expedited approval of the

     proposed experiment both because it opposed approval of the

     experiment outright, and because Dynegy/Coral argues that

     implementation during the summer peak period would cause problems

     for customers denied service under the MIC s proposal.  Given the

     absence of a showing of need for expedited treatment, we will

     reject MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed

     experiment.

          The MIC proposal would allow transmission providers, at

     reservation request deadlines, to retract their prior acceptance

     of unconfirmed customer requests for daily, firm transmission

     service and substitute pending pre-confirmed requests for such

     service, in order of queue time, up to the amount of daily, firm

     available transmission capability remaining.  The proposal

     includes phrases such as, "the transmission provider has the

     right to move to a retracted status" and "after which time that

     request may be retracted."  These phrases do not provide a

     standard for the transmission provider to use in deciding whether

     to retract customers' unconfirmed accepted requests for daily,

     firm point-to-point transmission service.  Careful monitoring

     would be necessary to insure that the proposal is not implemented

     in a discriminatory manner.  A customer whose request for

     transmission service had been accepted would have no way to

     predict whether a transmission provider might choose to retract







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -4-

     its acceptance, which would make it difficult for the customer to

     make alternative arrangements.

          Dynegy/Coral argues that the proposed standard addresses the

     problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers

     not confirming accepted transmission requests, but does not

     address the underlying problem caused by the practice of some

     transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests

     for daily, firm transmission service, even when customers submit

     their requests early.  Dynegy/Coral contends this practice puts

     customers in a bind that forces them to make alternative

     arrangements as a protective mechanism.  Dynegy/Coral argues that

     customers should not be punished for taking such precautions,

     even if they result in some unused transmission capacity.

     Dynegy/Coral argues that a better solution to avoid unused

     capacity would be for transmission providers to more uniformly

     respond to requests for daily, firm transmission service on a

     timely basis, rather than by taking the unwarranted step of

     giving greater priority to pre-confirmed service requests.

     Further, Dynegy/Coral argues that the MIC proposal would force

     customers to purchase transmission services they will be unable

     to use.

          We agree with Dynegy/Coral that the MIC proposal does not

     address whether the time period for transmission providers to

     evaluate requests for daily, firm transmission service needs to

     be clarified or shortened and that this is a relevant issue.  If

     transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily,







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -5-

     firm transmission service on a timely basis, then customers would

     have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled,

     and the MIC's proposed business practice might not be needed.  We

     request that the MIC reconsider its motion in light of the

     concerns raised by Dynegy/Coral.  After considering these issues,

     the MIC may, at its option, make a revised request for an

     experimental business practice standard.

     The Commission orders:

          The request by MIC for expedited approval of a proposed
     experiment on the

     treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily, firm transmission
     service is hereby denied

     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

     By the Commission.

Here's an editorial that gets to the heart of the matter.

Ghost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol 
Gray Davis is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos




JOHN M.W. MOORLACH 
Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector. 

A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced 
that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's 
subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has 
caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not. 
The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's 
annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the 
same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned 
utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the 
precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring 
a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face. 
That's why I'm gnawed by this "d,j. vu" sensation. The similarities and 
parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are 
frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer 
Robert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. 
The "experts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment 
scheme. 
No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing 
improprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how 
he was investing and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The 
unexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of 
borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated. 
It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized 
a $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck 
the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a 
half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the 
utilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire 
electricity through the use of long-term contracts. 
Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity 
spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the 
available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In 
spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis to avoid or 
minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history. 
It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rates 
and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The 
expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 
billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled! 
And in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced 
and only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no 
Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He 
has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of 
California by subsidizing their electricity bills. 
Bravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has 
anyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that's not all. He wants 
it back! Davis now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent 
reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail 
prices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop? 
And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not want to raise rates last 
summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically 
largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The 
ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davis is gone about his 
expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power 
grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say "no." 
If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers 
will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask 
Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 
million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis walked into his 
position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to 
show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No 
infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments. 
Wasn't that Citron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the 
citizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. 
Over 15 years it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, 
squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting 
from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership! 
It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial 
and continues to play the "blame game." Orange County played the "blame 
game," too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law 
in securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I'm not so sure 
California will have a similar result.

FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids

On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL=01,s proposal to implement a system where=
=20
generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up=20
price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price.  NEPOOL al=
so=20
proposed that when a supplier=01,s total revenues over a day from the energ=
y and=20
operating reserves markets were less than its total bid costs, the shortfal=
l=20
would be paid to the supplier as net commitment period compensation (NCPC)=
=20
uplift.  There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these upli=
ft=20
costs.

In approving NEPOOL=01,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system =
is=20
consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM.  With regard to=
=20
NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL=01,s exiting method of=
=20
allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is=20
appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of=20
uplift costs.  The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001.

FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information

In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a=20
discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathere=
d=20
by the ISO.  Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosur=
e=20
of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor=
=20
the actions of others.  FERC rejected Braintree=01,s arguments, finding tha=
t=20
FERC=01,s rules strike an appropriate balance between the need to disclose =
as=20
much information as possible and the desire to avoid disclosure requirement=
s=20
that will make it more difficult for the ISO to obtain information from=20
market participants in the first place.  FERC states that because data=20
collection is critical to the ISO=01,s ability to monitor the NEPOOL market=
s, it=20
does not want to take action that would impede the ISO=01,s ability to coll=
ect=20
this information.

Information Policy

NEPOOL submitted a March 5, 2001 request for revisions to NEPOOL=01,s=20
Information Policy, to be effective May 5, 2001, which permits FERC to obta=
in=20
NEPOOL Participant confidential information directly from ISO-NE.  On April=
=20
25, 2001, FERC issued an order approving the filing.  FERC stated that ISO-=
NE=20
should be able to turn over confidential information to FERC without first=
=20
being required to notify the affected member of receipt of a request for=20
information.  However, the Commission notes that the information given to=
=20
FERC will be treated confidentially by FERC until FERC rules otherwise, and=
=20
those Participants' whose information is given to FERC will retain the=20
opportunity to oppose release of that information to the general public=20
before FERC makes the information public.

Market Monitor Information Collection

ISO filed revised procedures intended to give ISO the authority to monitor=
=20
for generator physical and economic withholding as a way to raise prices. =
=20
Under the revised procedures, a reference price is calculated for each 10MW=
=20
block for each generating unit.  The specific reference price is an average=
=20
of in-merit bids over the last 30 days.  ISO will investigate all bids that=
=20
deviate significantly from the reference price. =20

Under the ISO's proposed procedures, prospective mitigation will occur if I=
SO=20
determines that the bid will have a significant effect on the relevant mark=
et=20
clearing price or uplift payment and the generator cannot adequately justif=
y=20
why its bid is not anti-competitive.  If a bid is mitigated, ISO will=20
substitute the generator=01,s reference price as its default bid.  ISO will=
=20
implement these new mitigation measures on July 1.  ISO also proposed to=20
release bid data after a 3 months delay (FERC previously ordered ISO to=20
release bid data after a 6 month delay).

Many generators opposed the procedures; Braintree argued they do not go far=
=20
enough.  On April 26, FERC accepted ISO=01,s changes, finding that they do =
not=20
give ISO too much discretion and are consistent with NYISO mitigation=20

Power in East Europe 

Issue?57 | 14/05/2001

Poland's SOK in limbo as Belchatow withdraws

Will Poland's long-awaited transition levy scheme to dissolve long-term power 
purchase agreement's (PPAs) - System Oplat Kompensacyjnych (SOK) - see the 
light of day? This has become one of the burning issues in central European 
electricity deregulation ever since the first draft was published in April 
2000. Subject to perennial delays and uncertainties surrounding its 
implementation as well as criticism from generators and banks, SOK has become 
the laughing stock of Polish power reform. This is a pity for it holds the 
key to price and regulatory transparency, as well as the proper functioning 
of the Polish Power Exchange (Gielda Energii) as its head, Jan Buczkowski, 
never ceases to point out.

SOK's credibility has been dented by the decision of Elektrownia Belchatow, 
Poland's largest and most fuel-efficient generator and the linchpin to a 
competitive power market, to exclude itself from the first group of producers 
to be covered by the scheme. Belchatow, along with Elektrownia Opole and 
Elektrownia Jaworzno III, were to start dissolving their PPAs on 15 April. 
But Belchatow, afraid that if it joined SOK its financial condition would 
worsen considerably since it would be paying in to the system instead of 
receiving payments, is not renegotiating its PPA with state grid PSE. Unless 
the plant is able to rid itself of its punitive below-market contract, which 
relieves it of its low-cost advantage, the prospects for a competitive power 
market are dim.
Opole and Jaworzno hope for 1 July
In an article in the daily Puls Biznesu on 2 May, representatives from Opole, 
Jaworzno III and Elektrownia Dolna Odra (which has taken the place of 
Belchatow) are quoted as saying that they are optimistic that they will be 
able to start phasing out their long-term contracts on 1 July. But investors 
have heard it all before. SOK was supposed to be implemented in the 
second-half of last year, then in the first-half of this year, and now it's 
questionable whether the 1 July deadline is realistic. All this creates 
uncertainty. 
"This is what investors hate the most. What's more, it's extremely difficult 
to estimate the effects of SOK given that there isn't any historical 
precedent," Puls quotes Piotr Samojlik, general director of financial 
advisers CAIB in Warsaw, as saying. But even a botched SOK, many believe, is 
better than a dead SOK.
One of the stumbling blocks concerns the ministry of finance's reservations 
regarding the calculation of VAT in the payments. Apparently, this has yet to 
be addressed. But Puls quotes Jozef Pekala, the president of Opole, as saying 
that his plant and PSE have already reached a tentative agreement on the 
model of the annex to the PPA and are now awaiting the final text. All 
Opole's units are under a long-term contract set to expire in 2012 and worth 
an estimated ZL5bn. 
Jan Kurp, meanwhile, the high-powered president of Jaworzno III (who also 
doubles as head of the mammoth Poludniowy Koncern Energetyczny), is also 
upbeat and hopes to close negotiations by the end of this month. The 
following month will be devoted to talks with the banks, Kurp tells Puls. 
Jaworzno has a long-term contract set to expire in 2008 and a smaller 
contract (covering 12-15% of capacity) expiring in 2012.
Juchniewicz ready to free prices
On 10 May, Leszek Juchniewicz, the head of Poland's energy watchdog URE, 
confirmed he would stick to his July plans to exempt generators from the 
obligation to submit tariffs for approval despite the distinct likelihood of 
a continuation of the PPA regime. This is one of the few pieces of good news 
that has come out of the Polish power sector for some time and will be 
greeted positively by investors. In an address to parliamentarians, 
Juchniewicz said that while wholesale prices will be freed, retail prices 
will, for the time being, be capped in order to protect small and 
medium-sized consumers. 
SOK's fate, however, ultimately rests with the banks and the plants who, for 
a variety of reasons, are not particularly enthusiastic about the programme 
and have serious doubts whether the issue of stranded costs can be resolved 
in a fair manner. With parliamentary elections looming, it is vital that SOK 
be implemented as quickly as possible in order for there to be no 
backtracking and/or revisions after the elections.

Rick:
Eight new projects--of which some are significant in size-- have been added 
to the list of the hot deals for May 25th, 2001.  They--and their suggested 
action items--are as follows:

 Project  Originator  Description     
EBS:
 Advertising JV  Erik Simpson  EBS to provide risk management to media 
buyer   ($28 million)
 Raven   Jeff Donahue  Purchase assets of managed hosting company ($400 
million)
 Samsung DRAM Ken Wang  1 month financing of DRAM Inventory (5 million)

Suggested Action Item:  Communicate findings to Sue Nord and compile GA 
comments for RAC, if any.  Lisa Yoho is also informed given the very 
interesting structure of Samsung DRAM deal that is likely to be repeated with 
other seriously backwardated commodities.  
EWS/EGM
 Weirton   Tammy Mulroony  Rolled Steal forward purchase ($ 75 million)
 Timber      Sale of 100 MM asset at cost  ($100 million)
 DPR accelerated put Mike Beyer  Exercise Put and reinvest in coal related 
assets  ($11 million) 
Suggest Action Item:  Communicate findings to J. Steffes, and Lisa Yoho and 
compile GA comments for RAC, if any.

Finally, I am taking the liberty to contact Paul Kaufman to inform him of 
project PortMorrow which is the developing of 47 MW peaking facility in 
Oregon for PGE (originator Chuck Randall).  I shall follow up with him in 
case that there are any needed action item.  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

This NERC announcement references that FERC would designate the new electric 
reliability organization.  In yesterday's FERC Technical Conference on 
Inter-RTO Seams, several of the Commissioners asked whether GISB and EISB 
were appropriate forums for the establishment of commercial/market business 
practices.

Subject: Broad Coalition Supports Electric Reliability Legislation


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and a broad-based
coalition of electric industry and state organizations urged members of
Congress and other key energy officials to support prompt passage of
federal legislation to promote and ensure the continued reliability of
high-voltage electric transmission systems in the United States and
throughout North America.  In letters to DOE Secretary Abraham, members
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representatives
Tauzin, Dingell, Barton and Boucher, and FERC Chairman Hebert, the
coalition stated that "It is critically important for Congress to act on
reliability legislation as soon as possible.  It will take many months
after legislation is enacted for FERC to adopt implementing rules and
designate the new electric reliability organization that the legislation
provides for.  In the meantime, consumers are exposed to increased risk
of failure of the transmission grid as more and more demands are placed
upon it."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
coalition's support is shown below.

A copy is also posted on the following NERC web site:

If you have any questions, let me know.

Sincerely,

Broad Coalition Supports Electric Reliability Legislation

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and a broad-based
coalition of electric industry and state organizations urged members of
Congress and other key energy officials to support prompt passage of
federal legislation to promote and ensure the continued reliability of
high-voltage electric transmission systems in the United States and
throughout North America.  In letters to DOE Secretary Abraham, members
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representatives
Tauzin, Dingell, Barton and Boucher, and FERC Chairman Hebert, the
coalition stated that "It is critically important for Congress to act on
reliability legislation as soon as possible.  It will take many months
after legislation is enacted for FERC to adopt implementing rules and
designate the new electric reliability organization that the legislation
provides for.  In the meantime, consumers are exposed to increased risk
of failure of the transmission grid as more and more demands are placed
upon it."

For three decades, NERC and its member Regional Reliability Councils
have worked cooperatively and voluntarily to set reliability standards
for high-voltage transmission systems so that customers could enjoy
reliable electric service.  As electricity markets become increasingly
competitive, this voluntary arrangement will no longer suffice and needs
to be transformed into a mandatory system to assure a continued reliable
supply of electricity to America's homes and businesses. "Congress must
act soon on reliability legislation," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC
President and CEO.  "Enacting this legislation now is an important step
to ensure the continued reliability of the nation's high-voltage
electricity system, and one that should not wait."

Signing the letter are the North American Electric Reliability Council,
American Public Power Association, Canadian Electricity Association,
Edison Electric Institute, IEEE-USA, Large Public Power Council,
National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, National
Association of State Energy Officials, National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, National Electrical Manufacturers
Association, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Northwest
Regional Transmission Association, Transmission Access Policy Study
Group, and the Western Interconnection Coordination Forum.

For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit
NERC's web site (http://www.nerc.com/).  The web site also includes
information on the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery
programs and activities.
*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

		 Subject: Re: IMO Meeting Highlights

This message came back to me (too big) - I am resending and will send 
garrett's paper separately.

__________________

Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three 
points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO 
Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving 
Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four 
Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that 
Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior 
people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in 
electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and 
the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the 
Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering 
A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling 
stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the 
government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize 
prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the 
Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting 
until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's 
financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the 
concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may 
be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim "force majeure" in respect of the 
Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition 
of "force majeure"  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if 
OPG  can claim "force majeure",  the predetermined "force majeure replacement 
cost" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to 
offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other 
words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market 
development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe, 
from OPG's perspective, now a "bad deal") that OPG made in 1999.  We should 
discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without 
compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward 
Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and 
day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this 
will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is 
a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away 
from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been 
working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material 
get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event, 
I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board 
and OEB.          `

		 Subject: IMO Meeting Highlights

Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:

 - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the 
1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news 
is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should 
have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March 
was highly probable.

 - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck 
I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.

 - Forward Market development - IMO "wants to make this happen". Assessing 
two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a 
conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward 
market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked 
re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke 
(WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market 
transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We 
need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market 
place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with 
creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie 
information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want 
to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this 
already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting 
from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise 
and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  
Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim 
Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform 
Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor 
operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to 
meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John 
Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" 
they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader 
subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or 
otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than 
the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the 
benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the 
DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.

Chris,

I think the letter looks fine.  I just made some very minor typo/cosmetic 
changes.  I guess the biggest remaining issue is the identity of the 
addressee?  To whom should Ken send this letter?

Thanks,

After a thorough internal review of Jim Doty's nomination, there seems to be 
unanimous support for the nomination of Jim Doty.  This has been confirmed 
after receiving input from Enron management in legal, commercial, and 
government affairs. 

One concern was that a future PGE sale would be in some way be impacted if 
Jim Doty were to recuse himself given his relationship with Enron. All agree 
he would recuse himself, which we knew when he was retained, and that the 
impact would be minimal.  Another concern, was the Washington media reported 
that Doty had in some way alienated Sen. or Mrs. Gramm, it was reported back 
to me that is not the case and the Gramm's do not oppose the Doty nomination.

The SEC nomination process is still moving rather slow and that no candidate 
has pulled in front, according to our DC consultants. 

The letter states Enron's broad support for Doty's nomination. It does not 
advocate any particular policy position or issue.

Please see attached a brief overview of the current legal framework for the 
control of NOx emissions in the EU as well as changes under preparation. 
Please note that the two EU directives which govern the current regime of NOx 
emmissions abatement plan on the pan-European level only set the minimum 
requirements. Nothing precludes Member States setting tighter limits on 
emissions when implementing these Directives into their national legislation.

Please see the attached New Democrat Coalition Energy Policy outline.  While 
not a comprehensive document, it does NOT call for price caps.  The New Dem 
plan does call for the development of national interconnection, as well as a 
creation of an Energy Reliability Organization to help facilitate the role of 
RTOs.  

This is in stark comparison to the DNC and Democratic Policy Committees 
approach.

I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag 
system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an "Adjust List" that is 
issued when TLRs are called. An "Adjust List" is a recommendation from the 
IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve 
needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to 
Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that 
are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination 
Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace 
of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current 
process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security 
Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend 
specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, 
leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or 
resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is 
sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the 
confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation 
to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for 
the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When 
all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out 
as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard 
Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are 
only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail 
different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to 
local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists 
should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and 
curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the 
majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final 
curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim 
Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris 
(Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily 
business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their 
assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and 
cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement 
this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  
Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how 
it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently 
Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am 
intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez 
to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our 
E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any 
questions.

		 Subject: Copy of Message from Judge Stirling, and a small Correction

I want you folks to read, carefully, the note I received from Larry
Stirling, who is an accomplished California politician, and currently a
Judge on the California Supreme Court.  Please keep the note
confidential.

I think you can see the dilemma.  Larry's vision has significant merit.
I don't see how we can get there.

Maybe this can be part of our discussion next Wednesday.

Also, I misstated the number of Board members necessary for a quorum.
It's 8, not 7.

Lots of good insight in your experiences.

it is always better to tell the truth. And it is better to tell it well to a
hostile group. That way you get noticed and remembered.

When only one side shoots, the other side dies.

Pete Wilson taught me that you do not get noticed fencing with yourself. If
he wanted a message out, he picked a fight with someone, that way the press
covered it. 

Here is one opportunity begging to be exercised.

Go give Lockyer hell for his unforgivable comments. He is after all the
Attorney General of the State, bound with an oath to uphold the law.

He is a long-time friend, racquet ball partner, power sharer. But his
comments give you an opening the size of  the run way for the space shuttle.
You should Nuke him for it in public.

Also, you have it right on the television bits. The talking head of a techie
male is not the answer.  

Also, the location of the interview itself has to be telegenic.

So, you need someone to soften the image.  You should considering hiring and
educating someone like Starr Parker, a brilliant black woman, committed to
private enterprise solutions.

Raoul Lowery Contreras, an articulate and unabashed Republican business
oriented Hispanic that knows exactly how to handle the press.

Since the face of California is changing, the face of the spokespersons has
to change with it to be credible.

I can get you in touch with either if you are interested.  I know that they
would like to help. But both need to be retained.

All the best, Larry Stirling

Rick and Jim:

As Linda and I discussed with Rick, attached are two memos which lay out the 
plan we discussed last week in Washington in how to restructure the 
Washington office.  The first memo is a narrative summary, and the second is 
more of an outline of the questions we addressed during our meeting last week.

I am still working on the last document which compares all of the legal work 
performed by Bracewell during the year 2000, and the work that we could 
perform in house if we are properly set up.

Let us know if you have any questions.  We look forward to talking with you 
about this.

Sarah and Linda

As mentioned in a separate email, visits to the EJ website peaked last Friday 
at 3,766, the day we placed the Brattle paper on the website. The two 
attached graphs show site visits on a monthly basis and page hits last week. 
The vast majority of visits on Friday were to the Japanese version of the 
Brattle paper.

Rick, I heard from my Bolivia regulatory team that the supreme decree is a 
reality and that it is very positive- including full recovery of the $100MM 
gas deferred account that we were hanging out on.  I will provide more 
details as soon as I receive them.  Ray

DWR now has authorization to buy down load at market prices.   

 Press Release 
   
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01: 285
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001 



GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE 

Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans 

LOS ANGELES 

Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes 
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, 
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large 
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power 
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating 
customers. 

"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor 
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even 
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources 
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they 
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."

The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent 
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent 
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned 
Utilities. 

The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer 
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be 
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the 
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated 
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of 
customers who sign up.

	EnergyIRS Resumes Issuing Private Letter Rulings
On Section 29 Tax Credit for Synthetic Fuels

The Internal Revenue Service announced April 20 in Revenue Procedure 2001-30 
that it will resume issuing private letter rulings on whether synthetic fuels 
produced from coal qualify for a tax credit under tax code Section 29. 
Section 29 provides a credit for the production and sale of "qualified fuels" 
produced from a nonconventional source, IRS said, including liquid, gaseous, 
or solid synthetic fuels produced from coal or lignite. In Rev. Proc. 2000-47 
(209 DTR G-1, L-1, 10/27/00), IRS stopped issuing rulings under Section 29 
because it said it was concerned that taxpayers claiming the credit were not 
processing the coal in the manner intended by Congress. 
IRS asked for information on the processes used to produce solid fuel for 
which taxpayers claimed the credit. It received numerous comment letters, 
many urging it to resume issuing rulings, others agreeing that some processes 
should not qualify for the credit. 

Ruling Requirements

In Rev. Proc. 2001-30, IRS said it will issue a ruling on processes it had 
approved prior to 2000. The production process must meet the following 
requirements, IRS said: 

substantially all of the coal used as feedstock must undergo a significant 
chemical change; 
the feedstock coal must consist entirely of coal fines or crushed coal 
comprised of particles no larger than 1/8 inch; 
the feedstock coal must be thoroughly mixed: (a) with styrene or other 
monomers following an acid bath, (b) with quinoline or other organic resin 
and left to cure for several days, (c) with ultra heavy hydrocarbons, or (d) 
with an aluminum and/or magnesium silicate binder after being heated to a 
minimum temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit; and 
the treatment method must involve elevated temperature and pressure that 
results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer 
may represent that the omission of these procedures will not significantly 
increase the production output of the facility.

The revenue procedure applies to both pending and future ruling requests. 
Rev. Proc. 2001-30 will be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2001-19, 
dated May 7. 
Text of Rev. Proc. 2001-30 is in Section L. 
Text of a Treasury Department news release on the revenue procedure is in BNA 
TaxCore.

Can you circulate the attached chart to Government Affairs staff.  The 
subject line should read "West Desk Organizational Chart."  Please put in the 
cover note that the chart is for internal Enron use only.

Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get 
personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.  Three 
expressed willingness to help.

Scott McNealy (Sun):  contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); 
scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.  Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a 
"cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 
elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the 
political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent 
time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of 
suggested contacts.
Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and 
Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.  Sharer wants the same 
information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to 
call a meeting of other California CEOs.  Sharer will also be having 
breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today.
Robert Day (Trust Co of the West):  said that he is very close to the mayor 
of Los Angeles.  He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).  Ken would 
like some talking points for that call.

Jeff - please put these items together.

Nailia and I are taking care of circulation of relevant material from Energy 
Council of Mon. and Tue. this week. She is also following the EU-Russia 
energy dialogue. 
Would either of you like to flip through the 135 page Competition Report and 
let others in the group know your conclusions (in less than one side A4!!)? 
By the way, you should meet each other, as soon as Brendan makes it to London 
or when Jan next comes to Brussels.

Dear Nailia,

Please find attached the first conclusions of the Energy Council which took
place yesterday. You will note that the Council intends to take a position
on the proposals for the opening of the energy internal market by the
Barcelone Council in spring 2002. We will contact several permanent
representations and the Presidency of the Council to ask about Member
States' positions on this issue.

Attached you will also find the agenda for the EU-Russia summit on 17 May.

I also include the 30th Annual Report on Competition Policy which deals with
the competition policy in general and by sectors, issued today by the
Commission. The report states that competition in the energy markets will be
introduced if the following  conditions are met:
* suppliers are free to compete for customers;
* customers are free to change suppliers;
* an effective, non-discriminatory and cost reflective TPA regime is
introduced and maintained.
The report also deals with the proposal for a new Regulation dealing with
articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, setting out the competition rules
applicable to restrictive agreements, decisions and concerted practices, and
abuses of dominant positions.

Would you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Regards,

Amaia

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and 
EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer 
filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power 
into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for 
these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  
We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.

Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC 
power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar 
to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file 
specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the 
industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  

Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  
We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may 
be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi  
37007.

Rick,

Unfortunately, contrary to the performance management system's reply (see 
below), performance reviews are not confidential in the DC office as the 
office manager has access to the passwords of some of the Vice Presidents.  

I would like to comply with your request to give a performance review for 
Cynthia Sandherr, but unless I can send it to you in a confidential envelope 
I have no guarantee it will not be seen at some point by my colleagues.  
(Your are listed as her supervisor according to the PEP system.)  This poses 
a problem for me.

Your advice is welcome.

is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w=

need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=

sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr=

at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes=
 our=20
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other=20

future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be=20
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),=

effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be=20
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and=20
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=
=20
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July =

all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe=
r=20
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable. =
=20
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=
nt=20

r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=

travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=

without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=

common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=

business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=

will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

 Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
"Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

The Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for the EPA to enforce its new 
"NOx SIP Call" regulations aimed at reducing NOx emissions in the eastern 
half of the U.S..?  The Court refused to hear an appeal by several electric 
utilities and Midwest states, which contended that the EPA had used improper 
criteria in setting the regulations.? The Supreme Court's decision lets stand 
a March 2000 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that 
upheld the regulations.? 

This means the NOx SIP Call regulations will go into effect with an 
implementation date of May 2004.  

Under the original SIP Call regulations, 22 states (AL, CT, DE, GA, IL, IN, 
KY, MD, MA, MI, MO, NJ, NY, NC, OH, PA, RI, SC, TN, VA, WV, WI) and the 
District of Columbia were required to submit State Implementation Plans 
(SIPs) to EPA by October 31, 2000 (with a grace period until December 31, 
2000).   Some states submitted SIPs by the deadline, but many are still in 
the process of developing SIPs.  Those states that do not submit SIPs or 
whose SIPs are not approved by EPA will be subject to a fallback Federal rule 
(FIP) and lose the ability to control NOx emissions from their sources.  A 
few states were excluded from the SIP requirement as a result of the 
litigation, but those states are in the process of developing SIPs anyway.

Now that the SIP call is final, we will be back to you shortly with further 
analysis of the SIP development efforts the states and other intelligence 
about what states and sources may be doing in anticipation of the regulations.

Please call if you have any questions.

Attached is a memo with an update on the status of hot-rolled investigations 
currently conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Preliminary 
determinations have been made in countervailing duty cases.  However, the 
actual duty rates will not be available until April 20, 2001.   Shippers will 
have to start posting cash deposits or bonds in the amount of duties on all 
entries of hot-rolled merchandise from S. Africa, India, Thailand, and 
Indonesia.  Duties on imports from Argentina were established in mid-March.

The memo identifies countries and individual shippers currently under 
investigation.  The regulatory group will provide an update as soon as duty 
rates will become publicly available.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Lisa Yoho or Masha Arefieva.

Greetings:
In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't 
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency 
level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

George Strong's contract with Enron expires on June 30, 2001.  Do I need to 
draft a letter thanking him for his service to Enron?  Or, should someone 
else send a letter?  Is it better to merely allow the contract to expire?  
Please advise.  

Joe is planning to attend NCSL in San Antonio in August.  He indicated today 
that he wants to attend the Southern Legislative Conference in Georgia in 
July .  I am planning to attend both of these conferences.   What are your 
thoughts?  Is it proper for me to approve reasonable travel for him, or would 
you prefer to discuss in advance?

Should we organize some type of lunch or celebration for Joe's retirement or 
transition to consultant?  

Thanks, Jean

Jeff --

A few other things that may be helpful. 

1. Mwhrs Sold and Total Revenues by Month (would be nice to have hourly 
info).  The Judge threw out a point that maybe the right answer was just 20% 
to Total Revenues.  I think that this would be horrible.

2. Reliant is providing to all other Sellers a Hourly Power Price using the 
March 9 FERC order.  Question - Can we determine from Oct 2000 - May 2001 the 
implications from this re-stating of prices?  Similar to the analysis last 
night, just different prices.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: RE: PR with Brussels correspondents

Eva,

No problem, as well as general European scen it may be topical to pick up on 
a couple of issues re' "Benelux" namely recent price spikes and actions that 
need to be taken to improve working of Dutch market (transparency on cross 
border, market power etc)  AND (linked) proposal by Electrabel to combine the 
Dutch and Belgium grids ie nice idea, devil in the detail such that need to 
solve causes of price spike issue before or as a condition of linking the 2 
grids.

Obviously Peter would need to present things a little more elegantly but that 
would be key messages.

Ross

Ross, Julie,

There are a few Brussels-based corerspondents we haven't dealt with yet with 
whom we would like to start building a relationship.  In general, we pitch 
for one-to-one media briefings with Peter Styles that cover general EU energy 
issues with sometimes a bit of a national angle.

Would the time be right at the moment to do this with some of the Dutch and 
Spanish correspondents or are there any sensitivities that we need to keep in 
mind? Ross, I already checked with Teun who said that he did not see any 
problems with this.

Please advise because we would like to get on with our "pan-European PR 
programme".

Many thanks
Eva

SBX 28 (Sher), related to expedited siting, passed out of both houses
today and was sent to Governor Davis.  The bill was amended to remove
the unemployment provisions which the Chamber and Manufacturers objected
to.  Some of the key provisions of the bill are as follows:

Expedites various CEC procedures for siting power plants;

Limits to 45 days and 100 days, until January 1, 2004, a local
jurisdiction's time for initial review and final review, respectively,
of an application submitted to the CEC;

Requires CEC to certify repowering projects within 180 days;

Extends from August 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002, the date by which
temporary "peaker" power plants must be in
service so as to qualify for the four-month siting process.

Requires ARB to develop expedited programs for retrofitting and
identifying and banking of emission credits;

Requires air districts to adopt an expedited program for permitting of
standby or distributed generation facilities and natural gas
transmission facilities;

Authorizes payment to air districts of mitigation fees for a new power
plant in lieu of obtaining actual emissions offsets, when the owner or
operator of the plant has shown that offsets are not available;

Waives conditionally, for a period of 10 years, standby charges imposed
by electrical corporations on customers who have installed non-gas-fired
distributed generation equipment five megawatts or smaller that commence
operation by September 1, 2002.  Provides that the waiver for gas-fired
units shall only apply until June 1, 2006.

Permits a gas corporation, until June 1, 2002, to exercise the power of
eminent domain to condemn any property for the purpose of competing with
another entity  in the offering of natural gas and services related to
natural gas.  Additionally, until June 1, 2002, prohibits CPUC from
making a finding on a petition or complaint  filed pursuant to Section
625 of the Public Utilities Code, and requires CPUC to dismiss the
petition or complaint.
