Subject: Lay WTO Speech

Rob has provided everyone a new set of slides for Ken's speech. They want Ken 
to speak for 20 minutes.  Once we agree on these we have to put together 
talking points for Ken to use. I would like to be at that point this 
Wednesday so we have the rest of the week to get feed back fro Ken and 
finalize the speech next Monday or Tuesday.

Let me try out some themes.

We need to put energy developments in the context of globalization. The 
world's economy is integrating as never before as transborder trade 
increases, capital becomes more mobile. technology speeds this process. To 
compete in this new arena countries must have access to the most talented 
labor, the most advanced technology, and the lowest cost, highest quality 
suppliers of goods and services. No where is this more critical that in the 
areas of energy production, transportation, distribution and use.

Historically, energy trade has focused on technology to explore, produce and 
export energy. In the 1990's the focus shifted to using that energy 
internally to fuel the tremendous economic growth experienced by developing 
economies. The focus became infrastructure development and inter-regional 
trade as governments removed the legal and regulatory barriers to private 
energy and infrastructure development. With energy demand increasing at high 
rates, the potential for price increases, the need to develop and use new 
energy technologies and the related environmental problems associated with 
economic development, the next focus must be on opening these same economies 
to the world class suppliers and partners which have the intellectual 
property, talent, networks and technology to provide the answers to the more 
efficient  production, transportation and use of energy. By opening their 
economies to an expanded trade in energy services, these countries gain 
instant  access to the skills and capabilities that have taken decades to 
develop elsewhere.

But it's not just governments that benefit. In the US and Europe today we 
have seen an explosion of customer choice in their providers of products, 
services, prices and terms.   The service industries have led the way in 
providing more value at better prices. This will help economies leverage 
their own financial, technological and intellectual capabilities.

Having put the need to have energy services on the WTO agenda I would now 
turn the problem of defining the energy services sector.  I don't like the 
third chart, Energy Services Overview - it's confusing. I don't know if you 
are listing the companies involved in services, in the coalition or what. I 
far prefer the type of chart Rachel Thompson uses in her environmental 
services presentation on page three: Some examples of environmental goods and 
services. We can briefly talk about the historic issues here, but also 
forward our recommendations on how energy services should be considered in 
the WTO GATS discussions. The inclusion in the next GATS round is not an end 
in itself but will start a process that will:

 Clarify the definition of energy services
 Identify the barriers to trade in energy services
 Set the goals for the desired level of market openess
 Establish commitments on transparency, due process and regulatory 
implementation

>From here we do a summary of global trends, the important role energy 
services will play in a globalized economy, how expanded trade in energy 
services can be a direct channel for technology transfer. This is the 
"win-win" section.

In turning to the slides Rob provided,  I have already mentioned my concerns 
about the second slide. The list of members of the coalition can stay- it 
represents the depth and variety of businesses in this area. The energy and 
infrastructure slides fit the initial story. The energy services megatrend 
slide has a long way to go. Maybe we can show the trend: production and 
export,  private infrastructure development, and the next step: mass 
customization. The privatization slide doesn't go here but I'm not sure what 
the point is or how we want to tie privatization to energy services. The 
globalization slides need to go earlier if we are to use the story I outlined 
but the globalization of energy trade slide is about the trade in 
commodities.  It doesn't fit- we are after data on the goods and services 
that make this trade happen, not the commodity per se. 

The customization is fine- we need to have solid talking points about why 
customization of energy services helps economies.  This will be a tough 
section- I don't think we have anything in the can exactly on this point. Do 
we need new markets for competitive energy?   Energy outsourcing and 
information age are fine,  I like the nexus between energy and environment. 
The talking points here should focus on this part of the energy services 
business.  EES should have lots of talking points in this area. The benefits 
slide can be expanded. I don't see the need for the fragmentation slide.  
Point? 

On the conclusions don't be so threatening. Rather than say must adapt, we 
should be talking about the benefits of embracing the new energy market.  Add 
a point about rising demand, environment problems, the need to produce and 
use energy more efficiently.

Subject: WTO -- E-Commerce



Joe -- I had a conversation this morning with Jonathan McHale at USTR on
the status of E-commerce after Seattle.

McHale said that the E-commerce moratorium put in place by ministers in
May 1998 was schedule to run through the Third WTO Ministerial (i.e.
Seattle).  Since that Ministerial was suspended (and not formally
ended), the US view is that the moratorium is still in effect.

As to the work done in Seattle, McHale observed that the E-commerce
people had reached a fair degree of consensus on an extension of the
E-commerce moratorium, a work plan to look at the applicability of the
WTO's rules to E-commerce, and a commitment about not imposing
unnecessary regulations on E-commerce.  Since the Ministerial was
suspended, that progress is in limbo, and the US and other WTO members
are considering how best to proceed.

I asked him about the comments attributed the EU officials that the EU
would agree to an extension of the E-commerce moratorium only if other
countries agreed to the EU's assertion that all E-commerce falls under
the WTO services agreement (GATS).  He said that the US would never
agree to that, and that other countries shared the U.S. position.

As to next steps, he suggested that it would be important for companies
to go through the current WTO commitments and the UN's Central Product
Classification (CPC) code to make sure that whatever E-commerce
activities they are engaged in are covered.  I mentioned the work we are
doing on energy services, and he said the work in E-commerce in
analogous -- we should go through and see what services already are
covered, and let USTR know if we think that something we are doing is
not covered and needs to be brought into the service definitions.  In
other words, define who we are, what barriers we face (or what areas
need to be kept barrier free), and what our key issues and markets are.

As Enron considers what its interests are in E-commerce, you probably
will want to think both about the activities you are directly engaged
in, and those activities your customers are engaged in.  For example,
the benefits of having the pipeline (i.e. bandwidth) unencumbered by
tariffs or unnecessary regulations would be limited if the products
delivered over the pipeline were subject to significant restrictions.

McHale was very open, and I expect he would be pleased to meet with
Enron if you wanted to get into a more detailed discussion of the issue.

Regards -- Bob

Subject: 

Maureen- would you distribute this note Friday morning  to everyone who 
participates in the Friday call. Thanks.T

Again I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from 
participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing 
to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address 
that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key 
activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over 
to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  
Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the 
broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group 
participates.

At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and 
Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions 
to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally 
putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. 
The MITI schedule is :

 November 19 -file comments
 December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to 
MITI/guidelines are official
 December 2 -submitted comments are made public
 December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws 
changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring
 January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs
 March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff schedule

Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may 
take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect 
many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received 
from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can 
actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  
Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the 
end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back 
to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the 
obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the 
rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met 
with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with 
USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European 
experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  
experiences we've seen in Europe.

Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in 
Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group 
that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also 
wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was 
created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I 
along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to 
represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP 
best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which 
provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do 
attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This 
was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite 
teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We 
just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner 
as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is 
life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the 
temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to 
some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their 
protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. 
Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against 
attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong 
endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative 
process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and 
kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with 
US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and 
plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong 
deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as 
open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face 
with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us 
to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.

Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle 
Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual 
effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.

Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the 
Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was 
to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services 
will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is 
included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been 
designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the 
period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The 
side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia 
conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), 
Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a 
conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about 
Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in 
separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's 
key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.

Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he 
knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to 
hearing from her how it went.

What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has 
become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's 
a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment 
and industry: 
 
 an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive
 demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the 
trade rules
 clarify the US trade agenda
 give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation
 open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out

Open markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to 
decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of 
the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC 
presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental 
groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the 
WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. 

I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for 
the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has 
cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have 
also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for 
violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is 
working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really 
at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a 
environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also 
be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous 
communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern 
cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting 
of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief 
and lessons learned.

Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks 
like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for 
holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that 
took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final 
budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of 
KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. 
Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal 
Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.

It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree 
that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long 
as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to 
Bangdalesh may come true.

We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political 
factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas 
through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal 
debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a 
great job.

We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start 
generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, 
Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy 
session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real 
opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. 

Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand 
book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can 
provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we 
have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs 
which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the 
future.

Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon 
trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects 
that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other 
companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an 
inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which 
projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is 
inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any 
project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are 
developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of 
Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we 
could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton 
project i have ever seen.

We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone 
problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.

I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan 
for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project 
along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El 
Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled 
with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and 
Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and 
infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas 
will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.

Steve:

Joe called and asked me to summarize for you the meeting between Nick and 
Carla a few weeks ago.

Nick outlined the current state of play in Tokyo.  To summarize what I took 
as his central message -- now is a particularly sensitive time for Enron in 
Japan.  They have a high profile and are establishing good relationships with 
the right government officials and business leaders, both publicly and behind 
the scenes.  They're in the process of bringing on a senior Japanese national 
in the reg/government affairs team, and an experienced PR person as well.  
Both come with their own set of contacts and experience that Nick would like 
to give an opportunity to develop.   With the electricity deregulation still 
shaking out, and Enron Online Japan just being launched days ago, Carla's 
high profile might be valuable at some point and on certain issues -- but now 
may not be that time. 

Carla replied that she understood the need for sensitivity.  She outlined her 
contacts in Japan, which are impressive.  She said she would only go to 
reinforce a message that a client wanted delivered -- to have another party 
support the Enron message to the right people is often valuable, especially 
in Japan.  She said she understood timing, and reiterated that she was happy 
to help when called upon.

No decisions were made on short-term travel by Carla to Japan.

To get our message out we need to go electronic.

Please click on this link:   http://www.pecc.org/energy/esc.html

This was done in only a few hours.  A job done by professionals would look
much better.

But as our friend from the French embassy mentioned, we really should have
a web page to disseminate our information to a broader audience.  We can
put a great deal of our information up for public information.  We can even
create a "members section" where the coalition members use a password to go
for latest developments, information on progress on the working groups etc.
 We can have a "chat" section where we talk to each other, and again, where
working group members exchange information with each other and with Hills &
Co.

The possibilities really are endless.  But efficient!

Terry:

I think I was alone among the energy services group in staying through the 
bitter and surprising end of WTO. I was together with Rachel Thompson of the 
OECD and services trade specialist Julian Arkell, who have been advising our 
group from a European perspective. So I thought I would give you my account 
of the final hours of the "Seattle Round." By the time you read this it will 
have been covered in great detail by the world press, but as of Saturday 
morning only the west coast papers seem to have gotten the full story, which 
broke around 9:30 pm Seattle time, Friday night.

I went back to the convention center about 11 pm, and as I walked up the 
block -- still cordoned off by riot police -- delegates were already 
streaming out of the building. Emotions ranged from tired to disgusted to 
dispirited. Inside, a final plenary session was underway led by WTO director 
general Michael Moore and US host Charlene Barshefsky. I watched the final 
moments of the plenary session on TV in the media center, where journalists 
laughed as Moore made lame jokes about Seattle hospitality and vowed to 
resist pressure to step down as DG. "I intend to fulfill my contract," Moore 
said. "I have a background of fulfilling contracts in the labor movement." 
This was a poor choice of language since it was probably the US-influenced 
attempt to launch discussions on labor standards that killed the round more 
than anything else. Following the plenary, Moore and Barshefsky held a press 
conference followed by another by representatives from the European Union. I 
sat in as an observer to the two press conferences, which lasted until just 
after 1 am Saturday.

The collapse of the launch of the "Seattle round" is extremely significant. 
For one thing, it means that there will be no Seattle round. Although Moore 
has been charged to come up with suggestions about re-starting the process 
beginning early next year, it is unlikely that either the political will or 
interest to do so will be sufficient before the US election campaign blows 
everything else off the calendar. Re-launching the round will depend very 
much on the complexion of the next US Administration, how committed it is to 
trade, how much it owes to labor, whether it can stand up to the 
environmental and labor groups that helped to derail the launch. Past 
experience suggests that it will take several years (three to four is 
average) to organize another attempt IF there is strong political motivation. 

The collapse seriously undermines US credibility in international economic 
issues. There was a strong feeling that the Administration had played the WTO 
meeting to domestic political interests, and overplayed its hand to the 
extent of jeopardizing the structure of the negotiations. One European 
journalist (Guy de Jonquiere, FT) asked Barshefsky what she thought about the 
common view that this was a "terrible mess, the worst organized conference" 
and that the sabotage was in part deliberate or at least that failure had 
been seen as a political option by the US. Barshefsky angrily rejected the 
question, and defended her failure on the grounds that "issues that had been 
intractable remained intractable." Nonetheless, the question expressed a 
general hostility towards the US as host organization, based perhaps partly 
on the discomfort of delegates who were beaten up on their way into the 
convention center, locked for hours on end in their hotels, and forced to 
hide their WTO identification tags whenever they left streets belatedly 
cordoned off for the event. Not to mention dodging protestors chaining 
themselves to hotel doors, boarded up stores, and transportation difficulties 
(several taxi companies went on strike on Tuesday and were thin the rest of 
the week).

The failure of the Seattle round comes at a time when the other Bretton Woods 
institutions -- the IMF and World Bank -- are under attack as well as the 
WTO. All three have suffered from retrenchment of US funding, relentless 
criticism by the US Congress, and waffling support from the Administration. 
The Seattle fiasco will put more pressure on regional organizations, such as 
the EU, NAFTA, FTAA, APEC, and ASEAN to continue to move towards 
liberalization and give them more reasons to move into defensive modes. We 
can expect to hear a lot in the next months about the possible fragmentation 
of the global trading system into regional blocks, just as we did in the late 
1980s when the Uruguay Round nearly collapsed. But a drift towards 
regionalism may not be all bad. To the extent that regional organizations 
themselves have a strong stake in keeping the global trading system open, or 
at least in preserving access to major markets, they may provide the momentum 
to continue work in some of the areas of interest to multinationals -- for 
Enron, energy services, environment and trade, and regulatory harmonization. 

Rachel Thompson, as an observer for the OECD, was in the so-called "green 
room" where negotiations shifted on Friday afternoon after the attempt to 
craft a ministerial declaration through working groups was abandoned. This 
represented a return to a more traditional GATT/WTO mode of horsetrading "in 
camera" or in a relatively small room, as opposed to the innovative but 
failed US strategy of crafting a text in pieces through five working groups 
(on agriculture, market access, implementation and rules, systemic and 
"other" issues including competition policy, investment, and the 
environment). The idea behind the working group structure was to open up the 
negotiating process, particularly to developing countries, and make it more 
democratic. Instead, it resulted in chaos. Rachel said that the green room 
discussions fell apart about 8 pm Friday when it became evident that the 
negotiators were "too far apart on too many issues." A crucial element, she 
said, was the outrage felt  by developing countries over Clinton's statements 
on labor rights and sanctions, in an interview en route to Seattle. Rachel 
described this as a political miscalculation similar to Clinton's bungling of 
the China deal during the visit to the US of Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji 
last March, when he played 

At a midnight press conference, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
defended the Administration's strategy, argued that the interruption to the 
WTO process was merely temporary, and described all the agreements reached 
prior to the breakdown as "frozen" and ready to move ahead once the round was 
launched. Barshefsky described the collapse of the talks as a "timeout" along 
the lines of previous occasions when GATT has floundered, as in 1982 (failure 
of the US to launch a services negotiation) and 1990 (failure to bring 
Uruguay Round to a conclusion as planned; the Uruguay Round ended finally in 
1993). Barshefsky was immediately challenged by EU commissioner Pascal Lamy, 
who said that the proposals submitted in Seattle were "dead" although some of 
the ideas would live on. 

"What I think happened -- this was the fourth in a series of this kind of 
episode -- was that the delegations came, they proceeded to work 
exceptionally hard and in good faith but were not quite willing to make 
political decisions," Barshefsky said. Lamy agreed that the issues were 
complex but added that the "posturing" of some of the actors helped block the 
launch. He blamed the collapse partly on faulty procedure. "Two days ago 
prospects seemed brighter [before the working groups were formed]. This is 
something that we do have to reflect upon." But he went on to say that the 
WTO itself was to blame for the problems. "The process has to be reassessed, 
reinvigorated, refurbished and maybe rebuilt," Lamy said. "Efficiency and 
transparency are common problems in modern institutions. The WTO does not 
have the institutional strength, the culture, or procedures to do this right."

What happens next, and what are the implications for Enron's effort in energy 
services?

First, nothing new will happen on energy services until a new round is 
launched;
This, however, gives us time to work on definitional issues. If the round had 
started as planned in March 2000, we might still be unprepared with arguments 
to support the "broad" definition of energy services we have promoted
Third, we will have time to build a dialogue with the EU and Japan in 
particular on energy services, and to cultivate programs similar to the APEC 
work program on energy services in other regional organizations
Finally, although we have viewed the proposed APEC work program on energy 
services as weak and a distraction from WTO work, this may turn out to be the 
strongest available vehicle to work on basic issues of definition and best 
practices

In terms of WTO itself, two streams of activity are possible, maybe three.

First, existing working groups will continue (separate from the drafting 
committees that were set up this week). The most important of these is one on 
domestic regulatory issues that is not time-specific, according to Julian 
Arkell. Julian describes domestic regulation and regulatory harmonization as 
the biggest future area of difficulty for WTO, and it is also one that is 
directly relevant to Enron's interest in regulatory standardization in 
electricity and natural gas regimes globally. The domestic regulatory working 
group has started programs on transparency, "necessity," equivalency 
(including harmonization), and international standards. Arcane as these 
discussions may be, they have enormous ongoing importance for the rules based 
global trading system.
A second possible stream is to push ahead with the so-called "built-in" 
agenda on agriculture and services. Barshefsky seemed to be arguing that the 
built-in agenda could go ahead regardless of the failure to launch a 
comprehensive round. Rachel and Julian both felt this was dubious. In any 
event, it does not help energy services because this was not among the 
"built-in" service sectors.
A third possible stream would be separate negotiations to complete the 
previous services round in 1994, along the lines of the 1997 information 
technology agreement and proposed ITA Two. Theoretically, energy services 
could be discussed or negotiated in terms of a reference paper indicating the 
unique features of the sector and advancing the agenda on domestic 
regulation. This also seems unlikely, given that the question of a broader 
services round now overhangs any discussion in services.

On electronic commerce, we might expect to see some different viewpoints 
along the lines of the basic split between Barshefsky and Lamy. However, Lamy 
said in response to a question that "nothing has been agreed" on e-commerce. 
"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The followup is probably up to 
the normal WTO process. Once that is settled, [the moratorium on e-commerce 
taxation] wouldn't be a problem and we can take the issue rapidly."

I may find out more during the day depending on who is still left in Seattle. 
The Coalition of Service Industries closed its room early this morning after 
doing a terrific job in terms of informing its members and corralling 
Administration officials to give briefings. We should take heart from CSI's 
experience. It was formed in 1982 to get services on the agenda of the 
Uruguay Round. It took four years to launch the round (in 1986) then another 
eight years to get the first broad services agreement (in 1994). This was a 
setback, but the meetings provided an opportunity to meet some new service 
industry players, such as the brand new Japan Services Network (established 
Oct. 15, 1999), a new services industry group in Hong Kong, and the European 
Services Forum. Back to the drawing board, but the drawing board itself is 
much bigger.

Cheers,
Edith Terry

INSIDE (AND OUTSIDE) THE WTO

 The World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial meeting began yesterday in=

OUTSIDE THE WTO
 A small band of demonstrators, most dressed like skeletons, animals, and=

Subject: Response to Carol Balassa Question No. 7


To all -- Below is a proposed response to Carol Balassa's question,
which gets at the impact of the energy services effort on government
monopolies for the ownership and provision of energy.  As I have
received various comments from a variety of people, I have tried to
reflect what I see as a general consensus.  The response is drafted as
coming from USTR, not from the ESC.

We should be prepared to discuss this on Monday [Tim, I know you will be
away, so if you have any comments, I'd welcome them before you head
out.]

Regards to all -- Bob

7.  What impact would such a description of "energy services" have in a
country where the government retains a monopoly over the ownership and
provision of energy?

"The United States welcomes and supports the efforts of countries that
are privatizing and deregulating their energy and energy services
sectors.  It believes such actions are in all parties' economic
interests.

However, as part of WTO negotiations on energy services, we seek neither
to require governments to privatize ownership of energy resources or the
provision of energy or to break up existing monopolies.

Our goals are market access commitments and a regulatory framework that
ensure that energy services firms are able to compete with all suppliers
in the provision of energy services on a fair, non-discriminatory basis,
under a timely, transparent and independent regulatory framework,
including access to transmission and distribution networks.  We want to
ensure that where monopolies exist, that they do not abuse that
position."

US-ASEAN Business Council Briefing Paper

PRIORITY BUSINESS ISSUES

prepared in advance of the
WTO Ministerials
November 1999


A group of 400 of America's leading companies, the US-ASEAN Business
Council prides itself as being dedicated to effectively strengthen
bilateral and US-ASEAN relations through strong economic and commercial
ties. The Council is committed to promoting open and free trade globally
with the belief that such an environment is of benefit to all. Open and
transparent markets translate into economic growth and the opportunity
to raise the standards of living of the world's people. In addition to
providing a larger range of goods and services, rules-based, open
markets allow countries to be more competitive in the international
arena.

In this spirit, the Council's members offer this briefing paper as a
compilation of the commercial issues we consider of highest priority at
the onset of the new round of the WTO negotiations. This is not a
comprehensive roster, rather attention has been given to issues which:

* Hold priority status for American businesses seeking to expand
their trade and investment ties in ASEAN; and,

* Have been advanced significantly through the APEC process and
have a realistic prospect of being concluded within the three year
timeframe.


PRIORITY ISSUES

Accelerated Tariff Liberalization: The agreement reached at the recent
APEC Leaders' Meeting in Auckland has provided the critical mass
necessary for action on accelerated tariff liberalization in eight
priority sectors within the framework of the WTO. Continued tariff
reduction will have wealth creating and efficiency enhancing effects on
global trade. The end result would be a larger international market that
will encourage the continued foreign investment and global capital
flows.

Agriculture: A robust global food system that efficiently links food
production, food processing and consumption, is vital to continuing
development world-wide. Council members support initiatives to remove
all export subsidies and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products. The
Council also supports activities to ensure market-access for
agricultural products enhanced with the use of biotechnology. Use of
this technology provides a safe and sufficient food supply while
ensuring the safety of food sources and environment through strong and
transparent science-based domestic regulatory systems.

Customs issues: The Council is encouraged by the positive progress being
made in the area of Customs reform and liberalization. In the context of
this on-going cooperation, members hope to see the adoption of the
International Express Carriers Conference (IECC) Guidelines for Customs
and encourage governments to continue to address: electronic
pre-clearance in a paperless environment; twenty-four hour customs
operation; elimination of export clearance procedures; higher deminimus
levels; transshipment without processing; and payment of duties and
taxes for imports at defined periods rather than upon arrival. Each of
these actions would improve the speed or lower the expense of shipment.
Countries that have adopted measures along the lines of the above have
reduced the bottleneck effect that Customs can create and have improved
the competitive environment for companies within their borders. This
attracts investment, which creates jobs and wealth.

E-commerce: In the past few years, electric or "E-Commerce" has expanded
the depth and breadth of global commerce. Although the physical
infrastructure is quickly spreading to support such transactions, the
legal and regulatory framework is still being developed. Both suppliers
and consumers of E-commerce will benefit from an improved legal
environment and measures to benchmark policies and best practices in
member economies. To ensure that the industry continues to develop, the
WTO should give special priority to adopting a permanent moratorium on
the imposition of duties on electronic commerce.

Energy: With growing demand for energy and calls for clean and efficient
use of resources, the WTO should look to promote the diversification of
energy supply and a market-driven energy infrastructure development.
Well-functioning markets, greater energy efficiency and information
flows among market participants will aid in sustainable and equitable
growth globally. The WTO should support initiatives like the APEC
Natural Gas Initiative signed by the Energy Ministers at Okinawa last
year and the ongoing policy dialogues to address energy service-oriented
issues related to the development, extraction, production, distribution,
marketing, consumption of all energy products..

ITA: The US private sector applauds the advances made under the 1997
International Technology Agreement (ITA) and looks forward to the
beginning of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement. While
the November 1998 ITA II package does not meet all of our expectations,
the Council's members are confident agreements resulting from the
successful passage of ITA II will increase product coverage, encourage
progress on the elimination of non-tariff measures, and lead to the
harmonization of tariff classification of products already covered in
previous negotiation rounds. The continued review and revision of the
ITA's product coverage will further expand and distribute the benefits
of information technology globally, and is a fundamental necessity for
such a fast-paced, dynamic industry.

Although the Council would encourage discussion of ITA-II during the
upcoming round of WTO negotiations, we believe that the ITA-II
negotiations should remain independent and should be concluded as soon
as possible.

I've set an interview for Ken Lay with David Ivanovich of the Houston 
Chronicle for Tuesday morning at 9.  David knows that we are "playing a major 
role" in the WTO, wants to know what we're there for, what our message will 
be.  The attached one pager is the basic point of our position on energy 
services--anything else that I should ask Ken to stress?  Rob, will Ken's 
speech be in good enough shape to either pull bullet points or let Ken peruse 
the speech beforehand?

David heard that Exxon has not signed on to the energy services coalition and 
wants to know why. I have found out from Joe Hillings the answer and will 
tell David that Exxon is most welcome to join the coalition and all parties 
would value their input.  Beyond that he can find out from Exxon why they are 
monopolistic!  (I won't say that part). 

Ken may be asked about our position on China's involvement, which we can 
handle.  Anything else you can think of that we might be asked regarding the 
event itself or the scores of protesters that will be there?

arbitration, and international transactions, he will work with resident
attorneys to provide clients with strategic counseling on a wide range of EU
issues. Ambassador Paemen will also assist attorneys in the firm's six other
European offices with matters involving EU law and policy.

"Ambassador Paemen has given the European Union outstanding representation
here in the United States," said Clayton Yeutter, Of Counsel to Hogan &
Hartson and a former United States Trade Representative. "He is a brilliant
diplomat and one of the world's most gifted and respected trade negotiators.
His international trade knowledge is encyclopedic."

"I view this next phase in my career as continuing my life-long commitment
to fostering better international trade and investment relations, in
particular between Washington and Brussels," said Ambassador Paemen. "I have
long been impressed by Hogan & Hartson's experience in these areas and the
sophisticated advice they offer their clients. I look forward to joining the

                 U.S., CHINA SIGN HISTORIC TRADE AGREEMENT

BEIJING, November 15, 1999    U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
and National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling today announced the
successful completion of bilateral talks on China?s accession to the World
Trade Organization.

Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling issued a joint statement that said,
AWe are glad that after thirteen years of negotiation, China and the United
States have agreed upon a strong, commercially viable WTO agreement for
China.  This historic agreement is a win for American export-related jobs,
for Chinese economic reform, for our global trading system and for the
long-term U.S. - China relationship.

Outline of the Agreement

This agreement provides significant access for U.S. agriculture, industrial
products and services.  China will reduce both tariff and non-tariff
barriers to industrial goods and farm products.  The agreement contains
strong provisions to address import surges and unfair trade practices.
China has agreed to take specific actions to ensure fair treatment for
businesses operating in China.  These include limits on technology transfer
requirements, offsets and export performance requirements.

Some specific examples from the agreement include:

China will cut duties from an overall average of 22.1% to 17%.
China will make even greater reductions on agricultural items of particular
     interest to the United States.
China will establish large and increasing tariff-rate quotas for wheat,
     corn, rice and cotton with a substantial share reserved for private
     trade.
State trading for soy oil will be phased out.
China will eliminate export subsidies.
American companies can provide auto financing.
New access for U.S. companies, including banks, insurance companies and
     telecommunications businesses.
Distribution rights for U.S. exporters.
Improved access for computer services, business consulting, accounting,
     advertising,  and financial information services.
Increased imports of foreign films, on a revenue-sharing basis, to at least
     twenty films per year.

In textiles, the U.S. and China agreed on appropriate measures to avoid
     market disruptions during and after the phase out of current quotas.


Next Steps

This agreement represents a crucial step in China?s WTO accession process.
Several important steps remain ahead.  First China must conclude bilateral
negotiations with a number of other WTO members, including the European
Union.  Multilateral negotiations on China?s accession protocol must also
be finished.  China must then complete its own domestic procedures for
accession.

In response to the commitments contained in the agreement signed today,
President Clinton will work with other WTO member countries to gain China?s
entry as soon as possible and will seek from Congress the approval of
permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR).

Current Situation: US and the European Community have proposed launching 
limited negotations in early 2001 with the appointment of working groups who 
would negotiate a limited number of items (as of yet unidentified) with a 
view towards reaching agreement by 2002.

14-16 WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated. Many believe 
that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included 
in the General Agreement on Tariff Services (GATS) and merely need to be 
tweaked for defination purposes. There is also recognition that a number of 
energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial 
services provisions.  We believe this is good news because it reduces the 
amount of bargaining that pro-energy services negotiators may find necessary.

Our trade counsel (Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our day-to-day counsel)has 
been very involved in the e-commerce issues and starting to get up to speed 
on financial services discussions. Both are quite contentious even among US 
industry. USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance 
in this sector because of these differences. A new element called 
audio-visual has emerged which Bob Fisher, Steve, Chris and I believe applies 
to our interest in "streaming." It too is quite contentious especially with 
the Europeans who want to control this potential item.

Cross-cutting Issues: You will recall in our earlier inside-Enron discussions 
we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles 
overlapping energy services, e-commerce and financial services. In a 
horozontal type of negotiation, effectiveness and vigilance in identifying 
cross cutting issues can become critical. These are now emerging as we had 
expected. This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and 
each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has 
application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative 
effect.

Concerns? The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the 
energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable 
in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece. That is 
good news. However, the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled. 
The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture. Agriculture 
has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services 
hostage unless getting their way.

What do we need? Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider 
China's accession. The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier 
date. The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues 
that China wants addressed in their entry document. Such an item as price 
controls on energy services and e-commerce. We're uncertain how important 
that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies. The 
politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the 
table. The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could 
recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council. The critical 
task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a 
negotiation.

USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present 
information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early 
October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets. Attendees would 
be WTO delegations and staff.

To put our best foot forward, we need to get energy companies in non-US 
countries actively involved in the presentation. Some potential countries 
with energy sectors who are strong politically in the WTO are Venezuela, 
Brazil, India, Egypt and South Africa. That will take work between now and 
October 1st to get organized. We have also asked AEI to get one of their 
contacts with developing nation standing to do a paper on the value of an 
energy services provision using Rachel Thompson's paper as a basis. We need 
this by September but don't know if AEI will comply. We met with Claude 
Barfield three weeks ago but he has not responded to our suggestion as yet.  
Rachel Thompson has proposed an outreach strategy run by APCO and Associates 
which is her employer. We would prefer to have Hills and Company run the 
program with people like Rachel providing assistance.

Budget: I have asked Hills and Company to prepare a budget proposal for 2001 
based on the assumption that Enron will continue to lead and provide the 
biggest amount to fund the US effort. If we can get GE, Halliburton and 
others to put in funds that would be excellent but is unlikely to materialize 
without Ken Lay speaking directly to GE, Halliburton and whatever other 
players we can identify. I see from the energy trade press (Energy Daily) on 
Thursday or Friday that Chevron has started an energy services division so as 
a member of ESC they too might contribute.

Our basic cost to maintain what we are currently doing will be approximately 
$320,000 for 2001. The outreach as I see it would require another $200,000. 
Hills and Co. would be responsible for what they are currently doing on 
energy services and e-commerce, the administration of the ESC and the 
outreach program. It would be great if we could get others to put in funds.

Successful to date: We have made good progress to date and believe that we 
are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation. The additional 
interest in e-commerce and possibly financial services seems to make our 
leadership and involvment commercially important.

 The attached matrix is a very thin start at what we are trying to do
in the Hydrocarbon Working Group.  We are listing our issue and want to fill
in the blanks for each issue.  Members of the working group will,
undoubtedly, add more issues but this is a start.  I do not know what
arrangement you have with Joe. So, Joe, let me know whether this is
something we can ask of Hills or not.  I look forward to both of your
responses.

To all ESC members:

At our meeting this past Monday, Carol Balassa (USTR) told us that she would
be sending to us for comment a matrix/concordance of the commercial
activities and commercial descriptions that the ESC provided the USG this
past spring (our illustrative lists) with the system used by the WTO to
classify services (the Provisional Central Product Classification [CPC] and
the GATS' own classification document W/120.  That matrix is attached below.
Also attached is a document that describes the meaning of the various CPC
classifications, so that you may interpret more accurately the matrix
prepared by the USG.  The materials largely were prepared by the ITC, which
has done yeoman's work and deserves our thanks.
The purpose of these materials is to see where our activities fall within
the WTO GATS classification system.

The immediate task for us is to try to answer various questions the USG
interagency team has about the types of activities we have told them our
sector does.  These questions are in boxes along the left-hand margin of the
text.  They often ask us for clarifications about what we have said we do
and to provide specific examples.  Beyond that, if there are elements on
which you have questions/comments, we should give that feedback back to
USTR.

The ESC Executive Committee would appreciate it if all members would look at
the questions and send us any guidance they can on issues of relevance to
their companies/associations.  We also would ask that the Chairs of the
various Working Groups (hydrocarbons, electricity, technology, and
renewables) particularly look at the document to see if they need to get
their Working groups together to review the questions and our responses.

Carol noted that these same documents will be submitted to the ISACs for
comment.  For those of you who are on the ISACs, it will help Carol and her
team if we can note where there might be a duplication in the comments
provided by the ESC and various ISAC members who also are ESC members.

Please direct all comments/questions to Bob Fisher at Hills & Company.  His
phone number is 202 822-4700.  His e-mail address is
"rcfisher@hillsandco.com".  Carol has asked for our comments by September 1.
In order to meet her deadline, we need to have comments to Bob by August 30.


With thanks to all for your assistance - Joe Hillings

Subject: Aaron letter change



Dear Transborder Data Flow Working Group:

A significant change has been made to the letter to Aaron.  The following
two paragraphs have been rewritten to achieve recognition of the adequacy of
the existing federal and state legislative framework.  Under the procedures
of the Directive, the Commission will have to make a determination of
adequacy, thus, the rewrite to soften the suggestion of how they make that
affirmative determination.

Article 25 of the EU Directive calls for "adequate," not "equivalent"
protection, and the Financial Services Modernization Act, added to the
existing federal and state legislative framework, establishes a high and
enforceable standard for notice, choice, access, and security of consumer
information. This comprehensive legislative framework achieves equivalency
to the Data Protection Directive in protecting customer information covered
by Title V of the FCRA.

Over the next 18 months, the European Commission should follow the process
of rulemaking and implementation of the Act during the Safe Harbor
transition, in order to make a subsequent determination of adequacy based on
how the Act is interpreted and applied.  In the short-term the Commission
should conclude that the federal and state financial services regulators,
with their new statutory privacy mandate, can serve as the independent
enforcement bodies for those financial services companies that choose to
certify under the Safe Harbor.

Please let me know if you object to this change.  The comments are due
today.

Sincerely,

Linda Schmid

Subject: Re: EWG meeting  

The Energy Business network survived the EWG meeting in Wellington. I'll give 
you a quick recap and my impressions and  we can decide if I should send a 
note out to everyone next week or wait until we meet on the 15th for my 
report. The official  report should be on the internet Monday.  A meeting of 
the EBN has been scheduled in Melbourne on March 18-19 to coincide with the 
Davos Meeting.  They are also talking about an EWG meeting in March also.

I will be late for the meeting on the 15th. I have a black tie dinner on 
Tuesday night and will take the first plane to Houston from New York 
Wednesday  AM. Sorry but I can't get out of the dinner, it's been planned for 
a long time and I have guests.

20 countries were present. If you look back on the agenda for the 18th 
meeting of the EWG business network  on November 18-19 in Wellington, four 
agenda items were of particular interest to the Energy Business Network:

 1) the report on the 2nd meeting of the  EBN meeting:  we were forewarned 
that the activities of the EBN would be under attack by the Japanese, Chinese 
and Mexicans.
 2) the discussion and report on the EWG implementation Committee's Visit 
Team to Thailand, 8-10 November 1999.
 3) the DOE recommendation on a Proposed Plan of Work on Energy Services- 
again very controversial.
 4) the proposed Energy Ministerial in the US in the Spring.

Mexico, China and Japan were not happy with the proactive push of the EBN.  I 
assume it was Mexico that made sure we were excluded from the discussions on 
the Thai visit and energy services, two EBN initiatives  Barry and I would 
only be allowed in the room for the EBN report, something I protested prior 
to the meeting. With the help of Tim Mackey,  we somewhat circumvented the 
restriction by his going around the room one by one after Barry's report  
asking for reaction to what was said.  This forced a discussion with us in 
the room.  Both Barry and I responded to the issues raised.

The dissenters maintained that the EBN was working too fast  and that we were 
taking the initiative away from the EWG and becoming too independent. Japan 
supports the concept of the EBN but made it clear that it was the EWG that 
sets initiatives.  The EBN "summary of decisions" was a particular affront.  
We had strong support from Australia, Canada, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
the Philippines (they are concerned that the EBN not duplicate EWG 
initiatives) Singapore, Thailand, and the US.  China surprised us by 
complaining that the EWG and EBN meetings were now separate, not back to 
back. Barry explained this was more an accident that anything else.

It took some effort, but I think we made our case. I emphasized strongly that 
the EBN consisted of some of the best and brightest in the energy industry 
and that we would not be shy about  offering our ideas. We operate with a 
great sense of urgency seeing that APEC will eventually $30 trillion of 
investment to meet their energy needs. Each economy could accept of reject 
these ideas but I doubted they wanted to be a rubber stamp for the EWG. As 
for energy services, as I understood it, the DOE program was designed to get 
the EWG up to speed on what energy services are, an educational effort that 
compliments what is going on at the WTO.  Services represented stage three in 
energy development that would increase the efficiency of the infrastructure 
and offer new products and services to users of energy.  The key discussion 
would occur on Friday in our absence.

There were two official reports on the Thai meeting, one by the secretariat 
which was more of a recap of the process and agenda with no evaluation of the 
success and one by the Thai's, the last paragraph of which was very 
favorable.  Ironically, the controversy concerned the process by which we 
participants were chosen. No one has been able to explain to me why the EWG 
would care about this issue and I honestly believe that the USG was a major 
factor in stirring this up and when you cut through the bull, it's about 
exerting control over the EWG.  Again, everyone was in support of the 
consultative process and the value it  brings in opening dialogues on 
difficult issues.  I noted that the Thai's should get particular credit  for 
being so open and candid in the discussions.

In our absence there was a long discussion on the Energy principles endorsed 
by the EBN which were turned back into an Energy Charter.  They agreed that 
an Energy Charter statement would be drafted by the secretariat and 
circulated to member economies.

The implementation committee discussion on Friday was supportive but as I 
noted but  focused on the process, not as I emphasized it should be- on the 
results which were a success. They was strong support led by DOE/USG to 
eliminate the steering and implementation committees. I did not see the final 
language and was presented with two conflicting versions: one that letters 
requesting a visit would go to the secretariat who would forward them to the 
EWG and EBN for suggestions on who should participate, the Secretariat 
deciding, and one where the Secretariat sends the request to the EWG and they 
consult with their EBN representatives and decide.  I made it clear that the 
latter process was unacceptable and the EBN would strongly oppose it. This 
process would take months and the EWG was in no position to decide who could 
best provide the people to address an economies specific request.  I told 
this to the USG delegation and they assured me the former would be the model. 
We'll see.

Energy services was also a long discussion and the Japanese focused on 
severing this initiative from anything to do with the WTO. In my private 
discussions with the Japanese, they expressed the concern that this could be 
considered an endorsement of the liberalization of energy services and used 
against them in the WTO negotiations.  Again, I didn't see the final outcome, 
but I understand that at the next EWG meeting, will present a trimmed own 
version of the work plan minus any reference to the WTO. It was agreed that 
there should be a seminar on the topic  but the EWG would only consider a 
seminar at the next meeting. This is way to slow and Barry and David think we 
need to get a white paper before the EWG in the next few months and push for 
a seminar at the next EWG meeting.  This is awkward for me since the US EBN 
has no position, but the entire EBN supports this effort as does the USG and 
we need to work with everyone to make the effort a success.

With great skepticism that the US can organize a Ministerial in five months 
(Edmonton took ten months), the EWG agreed to a Ministerial May 8-12.  At the 
EWG meeting on Thursday, I pushed the idea that the day before the official 
meeting should be dedicated to a series of direct interactions with the 
business community much like the Latin meeting in New Orleans.  The USG said 
they will include this idea in their proposal at the January steering 
meeting. The Ministerial will be on the west coast.

I am glad that I was there even though many of the discussions were painful. 
We beat down and reconfirmed strong support for the EBN, although it may be 
watered down, energy services is still on the table and can still be a 
valuable  educating process while meeting the concerns of some of the US EBN 
members, the consultative process is alive and well -- we'll see if it's been 
wounded -- and we may have a great opportunity in May for direct interaction 
with the energy ministers.

Wish you had been there. It rained for four days.

Justin/Amita - I just got off a conference call with some of my colleagues in 
the States who deal with public  policy issues for Enron in the US and 
abroad.  We talked about some emerging issues in e-commerce.  I told them 
about your excellent presentation on Monday on some of the issues that arise 
in due diligence for new EnronOnline products, and even though it is not 
directly on point with some of their issues, I think they all felt it would 
be enlightening to at least have the benefit of a copy of your presentation.  
May I ask one of you to send a copy by e-mail of your presentation materials 
to the other addressees on this e-mail?  thanks  mcs

I. Exhibit

The WTO Energy Services Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the 
word on the goals of ESC.  We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace 
- the name of the exhibition.  We distributed hundreds of the one-pager on

II.  Energy Services Panel: How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade 
Negotiating to Secure and Expand Markets

Chair:
Terry Thorn,  Senior VP, Enron
Panelists: 
John Easton, VP, Int'l Programs, Edison Electric Institute
Ian Miller, President, EDS Global Energy Business
Tim Richards, Sr. Manager, Int'l & Gov't Affairs, GE
Rachel Thompson, Administrator, Trade Directorate, OECD

Attendance at the panel was impressive with over 40 academic, government 
(officials from the US, Norway, Portugal, Costa Rica, Holland, and Israel) 
and private sector participants - in fact, we had to keep adding more chairs.

Terry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future 
of the industry in a liberalized market.  Tim Richards provided a summary of 
GE's view of energy services, outlined the current WTO commitments related to 
energy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services, 
identifying barriers, and setting a negotiating approach.  John Easton 
outlined the debate on classification of energy services (goods vs. 
services).  Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to 
the EU (especially the German and French) liberalization experience.  Rachel 
Thompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services.  Rachel went 
on to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental 
services with its focus on a win-win approach to trade and environment (this 
is similar the win-win-win approach USTR has adopted).  The OECD work program 
on environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services. 

A lively discussion ensued on the following:  the link between environmental 
and energy services, the NAFTA (negative list) negotiating strategies, 
challenges of definition and classification, and e-commerce effect on energy 
services.

Terry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him 
contact information so we can create a global network on energy services.  We 
can do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network, which 
is an informal, private sector-led on-line community dedicated to 
liberalization of services (we can start a sector specific network).

Thanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such 
a success.

Please see Terry's and Tim's panel presentations attached below:





WSC Plenary

On Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the 
panel recommendation to the WSC Plenary.  Each chair was given 3 minutes to 
present its recommendation and 4 Gov't representatives then responded.  The 
recommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in 
advance of Seattle.

In addition to energy services, recommendations were delivered on e-commerce, 
banking, insurance, entertainment, transportation, China, accounting, legal 
services, and express delivery.

Terry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation.  Attached below are Terry's 
transcribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation.  



The government responses were as follows:
Stuart Harbinson, Permanent Rep. of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the 
WTO Council on Trade in Services: 

Any guidelines on energy services must be general in nature.  
Industry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to 
raise energy services as a priority. 
 Gov't of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services.

Joseph Papovich, Assistant USTR, Services, Investment & Intellectual 
Property: 
Energy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the 
private sector.  
Energy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated 
accordingly.  
Note of caution:  attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if 
countries (often developing countries) view this as a mandate for gov'ts to 
privatize energy assets.  Instead, it should encourage open and transparent 
regulatory processes when privatization occurs.
U.S. supports including energy services in the services round.

Katsuhiro Nakagawa, Special Advisor, Ministry of Int'l Trade and Industry, 
Japan: 
Japan is currently deregulating its energy sector
 A "primitive" debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs. 
service
Resource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese 
negotiation.

In summary, I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global 
allies in our efforts.  Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they 
were in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a 
short time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings' outstanding leadership of the 
ESC.  Thanks to all for making the World Services Congress a success.

Please contact me with any questions or concerns.

INSIDE (AND OUTSIDE) THE WTO

INSIDE

 Renato Ruggiero, former Director General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for
Service Industries on Wednesday evening.  His remarks were some of the best
made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably
not appear in print.  Among his observations were:

* 1.7 billion people residing in 30 countries are trying to get into
the WTO at this time.  The WTO is regarded by many as the organization
needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find
themselves.
* Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have
their issues heard.  Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO.
That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only
understandable, it is flattering.
* (Concerning the demonstrations) "As long as reason rules over
emotions in this world, the WTO will prevail.  The demonstrator's goals may
be right.  I don't know.  But, their aim is wrong.  The WTO should not be
their target."
* The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more
determined to finish their work.

The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result.  Environmental
groups previously in disagreement or acting independently, have taken the
occasion of the WTO meeting to unify.  Greenpeace, The Sierra Club, Friends
of the Earth, The National Wildlife Federation, and The World Wildlife Fund
have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round.  Their goal is to put
a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO.  As of this writing, it is not
clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made
part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely.  What ever they
decide, the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to
be heard in the future.

Prior to the President's arrival, agriculture and other difficult issues
were making significant headway towards resolving differences.  The
President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would
have a positive effect on negotiations - but the opposite occurred.  His
ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the
WTO to include the demonstrators and, until he granted an interview with the
Financial Times, the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations.
The Times article was published on Thursday, however, and it upset everyone.
In the interview, President Clinton stated that core standards on labor
should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements.  If they
were not followed, they should be enforced with sanctions.  Until these
remarks, the administration had maintained that only a working group on
labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between
trade and labor.  The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the
interview was published.  The United States Trade Representative was rumored
to be very upset and the President's remarks met with almost universal
condemnation.  Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong
statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations.  Many see
the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTO's mission.  There was
speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with
labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really
believe they would have any effect within the WTO.  They did - and the
effect was all negative.

President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to
include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African
Trade bill.  At one time, prior to the President's arrival, there were 30
members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.)
and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs.  Individuals
representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side
with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party,
all waiting for the President.  When he didn't appear, the congressional
representatives left the stage and mingled with about 100 guests.  It was a
lobbyist's dream!  For 45 minutes, they talked, joked and lobbied while they
waited for the President.  He arrived, made a predictable speech and left
the stage only to find that, for security reasons, he would have to remain
in the room awhile longer.  It turned out to be one of the most festive
events of the week.

OUTSIDE

 498 people were arrested as of Thursday morning.  Delegates from
many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and
expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets.  Third
world countries have been the most critical.  Their concerns focus on
improving their economies   They need infrastructure and financing before
they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that don't even
boarder their countries.  Many of them do not disagree with America's basic
goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of
third world countries progress.

 As days of disturbance continue, the humor of the demonstrations is
diminishing.  What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on
destruction.  The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people
in Seattle is now beginning to show itself.  King Country Councilman Brian
Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening, surveying the damage and
trying to mollify the crowds.  He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a
vandalized Starbucks and he approached him.  Derdowski told the would-be
looter he really shouldn't take the bag of beans and the man dropped the
bag, hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots.

 Nancy Woodland and her husband, both Seattle attorneys, saw the
violence on television on Tuesday.  By Wednesday afternoon, they were in the
heart of town with Windex, Comet, SOS and elbow grease.  They spent most of
the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses.

 Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store, has seen his business
drop by 90%.  When interviewed by a local newspaper, he simply smiled and
reached for one of his cards.  He handed the reporter a card that read,
"Tough times are like speed bumps.  They only slow you down for a little."

 This will be my last report from Seattle.

Rick,

Here are some articles which examine the ineffectiveness of WTO agreement  
(1997) on the opening up of the telecommunication markets around the world. 
One of the major forthcoming issues is Japan's risk of tbeing aken to the WTO 
over its high access costs in the Japanese domestic market.  
Both the US and EU have been urging the Japanese to bring down the cost or 
face the consequences.  We are still waiting to see what will happen in 
Brussels? Whether the WTO have enough power to enforce its regulations would 
be a major factor in determining the its prowess in the future.  




best regards,

1.   I am glad to be on the group.   However, I will be in Singapore Jan 13/14
during your Houston meeting.   I can perhaps call in for part of the time on 
Friday the 14th
from Singapore ( I will be offsite at a company event).   Please include me 
when 
you give out the call-in number. 

2.   What I can do:   You asked for us to think about associations we could
get involved in this.   There are several.  I have been asked to form an 
energy
committee of the Singapore American Chamber of Commerce.   We hope several
US energy companies will join.  The committee will cover all of SE Asia.   So
I could vet this survey and whole ESC concept with them  if you like.    Same
goes for AmCham Thailand and AM Cham Singapore.

3.   The survey.   I have tried my hand at a notional (quick and dirty) 
response
to the survey.   It is attached for openers but it is incomplete.   A full 
professional
response on all the legal/commercial barriers would require me to pass it by 
regulatory affairs, lawyers, commercial, etc. for our region.  Do we need 
that?

Steve: I had a memo from Rick in response to our trip report last week 
regarding the meetings we held in Helsinki and Brussels. He again has raised 
the issue whether or not we are expending too much effort on the energy 
services liberalization and has no doubt that we are.

I did call him as requested on Tuesday morning Houston time after Ken Lay's 
presentation (it was excellent and has been getting good press) and suggested 
that you, Rick and I get together for an update. Rick wants to have another 
group conference call but I would prefer that we not have any such call 
because several of the participants have no day to day understanding of what 
has been accomplished and what can be accomplished.

A lot has happened in the last several weeks and the WTO Committee on 
Specific Committments meets again next week. USTR believes that it is likely 
to be important for the Energy Services Coalition to conduct a work shop for 
WTO delegations in Geneva during October. USTR and others are pushing for a 
launch of actual negotiations late this year or in the first quarter of 2001. 
Our goal  continues to be to make certain that energy services is one of the 
sectors negotiated. That is not yet decided but the October and possibly 
Novemeber meetings of the Committee on Specific Committments is thought to be 
ready to recommend a launch.

Ken and our people in Japan believe that we should follow up the invitation 
of Mr. Kushakawa and brief Japan energy officials on our energy services 
campaign. Carla Hills is prepared to go to Japan late this month. Bob Fisher, 
Steve Burns and I would also go. We have been talking with Nick O'Day to 
coordinate with our people in the region to advantage their goals and from 
the correspondence I just forwarded to you, I see our people in Japan 
supporting whatever we can do using Carla Hills as the principal messenger on 
energy services at the WTO.

While in Paris, Ken Lay met with Rachel Thomson and me to get updated on the 
energy services campaign. I have asked Rachel to put togeher a package on 
helping us within the WTO and in educating certain strategic delegations that 
have persuasive powers withing their regional blocks. She has made that 
proposal. Ken believes that several ESC companies such as GE and Halliburton 
should be able to put up funds to handle that part of the cost and is willing 
to call Messrs Welch and Chaney directly if we go forward.

Based on what I have heard over the last few months I believe we now need a 
paper supporting energy services from a distinguised expert from a developing 
nation essentially supporting the Rachel Thomson material.

What I am suggesting is that if the company continues to feel that pursuing 
an energy services liberalization at the WTO is positive and accelerates our 
own efforts to get nations to agree to liberalize sooner rather than wait for 
a two or three year WTO process then I think that the items mentioned in this 
memo should be approved and go forward. If the company disagrees then after 
this July meeting of the WTO Committee on Specific Committements and after 
the meeting in Japan near the end of July should be the time for us to plan 
the "exit" strategy. Whether or not Halliburton or GE would pick up the 
campaign is unknown to me. I do plan to get together  with the ESC Executive 
Committee early next week to tell them in detail about the new proposal by 
Rachel Thomson.

I would like your authority to move forward on the several items I have 
suggested including funding for a developing nation paper, the trip to Japan 
later this month and at least an initial funding (estimated at about $30,000 
for APCO (Rachel's employer) to get the ball rolling on a longer range 
strategy through October). I would prefer to have any conference call 
postphoned until you, Rick and I meet and have a thorough discussion.  I do 
believe that Ken Lay supports this effort and feel that if I am correct then 
Rick needs to understand that he is sending a conflicting message. If I am 
wrong then I need to know it and the discussion of an exit strategy needs to 
be discussed in detail.

Please review and advise.

Joe

Scott: Steve Kean and I discussed a conversation that Tom Gros had with him 
regarding assistance relating to the WTO. You will recall that Carla Hills 
and Company is providing assistance to the US WTO Energy Services Coalition 
and I raised the issue of e-commerce with Bob Fisher of that company this 
morning. He was kind enough to send the attached paper which will of of 
interest to you.

I also spoke with Allan Miller of EDS who is leading the Coalition of Service 
Industries e-commerce effort and he briefed me on several WTO related matters 
likely to be considered during the three or so years of upcoming 
negotiations. I believe several of those issues especially the desire of the 
US e-commerce industry to fight efforts by the Europeans to restrict 
cross-border committments, add costly regulation (the US e-commerce industry 
opposes regulation but does want to have services addressed) and achieve 
technical neutrality are potentilly important to ECI.

Allen is also sending me a paper that I will forward to you.

You were good to introduce us to Steve Miller of your Washington, DC law firm 
group who is experienced in global regulatory and trade developments. He sent 
us both several e-mails but I (for fear of running up legal bills 
unnecessarily) but I have never responded nor asked him to get involved.

We plan to have an addition to our Washington staff in January or February of 
an executive who can address these matters globally.

After you or your ECI collegues reviews the various papers, I would be 
pleased to review your priorities relating to WTO.

Regards,

Joe

Bill Thomas's staff related to energy services and e-commerce.  Our
understanding is that Mr. Thomas plans to circulate the materials to
other members.

If there is anything we can do to help you on e-commerce, just let us
know.

___________________________________________________________________________
Dear Friends: Please review, correct, make additions and return. Joe


The Energy Services Coalition (please note that we are no longer using
US
WTO ESC) met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her
perspective
on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs
to
accomplish as well as a time perspective.

Present from the USG were Carol Balassa (USTR), Josephine Ludolph and
Richard Boll (DOC), Russ Profozich (DOE), Patricia Norman (DOS) and a
regular from the ITC.

Joe Hillings, Christina Bolton, Bob Fisher, Steve Burns, Brian Petty and
Chris Long represented the ESC.

Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several
phases
of activity. She started the session by telling those present that the
lack
of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish
this
coming year. We are on track and need to produce various position papers
as
early as the end of January.

Articles 19 of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on
agriculture
and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to
achieve
agreement..

Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations
beginning in January.

A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility
to
draft issues. The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC
by
the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the
Committee.

A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On
Domestic
Rights.This group is chaired by Peter Collins. Peter needs to know what
are
the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members
as
reasons not to liberalize various sectors. This information is to be
supplied in the first half of 2000.

In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of
their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are
needed
to be tabled in the negotiation. They expect these working groups will
begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer.

Three basic columns headed by (1) Market Access, (2) National Treatment,
(3) Additional Committments (Could be proposed annex such as the process
Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing
examples) is the format to be developed for the two groups.

Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention
of
getting Less Developed Countries (LDCs) supporting our basic principles
in
case a multilateral negotiation is not launched. We should work the
current
liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA
negotiations..

The next phase of Carol's presentation addressed the recent response
USTR
received to the questions they submitted to DG 17 (it no longer exisits
under the new commission) asking the EU to address their feelings about
the
liberalization of energy services.

We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms.
Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure
industry responce. Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting
are
trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they
characterized
as "confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current
practices and developments in the energy services sector."  We do know
that
the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU
response that electricity is a good and not a service. Our immediate
response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members
and
the EU staff. The movement of electricity across national boundries may
be
a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service.

The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that
many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT
covered
such as construction, engineering, etc and therefore, may not need to be
raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least
need
some sort of annex to make sure they are included.. The EU believes that
if
you own or operate electricity producting  then its a good but if you
operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties, its a service.

We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover
renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in
Europe's
plan to diversify and develop green energy.  They also believe that
price/risk management should be considered under finance services not
energy services.


The session was then open to general discussion. Bob Fisher commented
that
the EU does not seem to understand the scope of today's energy services
industry. That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has
been
developed. What about environmental services? Again, the EU response is
confusted and incomplete. Apparently they feel that environmental
services
can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation.

Who from the EU drafted this paper? The staff has changed and we don't
know
how "high" in their heirarchy this was considered. Carol Balassa
responded
that she is trying to determine who drafted the response..  Brian Petty
advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed
and considered at the highest levels of the Commission.


Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before
"talking" to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond
and
discuss their current returned response. Therefore, she is asking the
Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working
Groups
which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic
negotiating position papers.

The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in some"capacity
building." This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member
delegations on the meaning of energy services. Carol suggested that
after
her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry
group
meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has
evolved
and what is included in energy services.


We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself. Bob Fisher
reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC
process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such
as
renewables, heating and certain trading and financial services would
need
to be added. To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC
and
therefore suspicious of any such document, we should remove the
reference
to APEC.

Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our
Electricity
Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a
footnote
known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we
believe constitute energy services under that heading. Bob Fisher said
that
this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material
prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process.  Bob said that once
negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can
"fit" whatever they want under the broad definition.

The last question raised was what happens to the ATL (accelerated tariff
liberalization) which also covers some energy matters which WTO
countries
had contemplated being approved in Seattle. Carol said that she did not
know.

The meeting then adjourned.


The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the
questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to
prepare the basic document. Working Group chairs are to be asked to
complete this process by mid January.


Dear Reviewers: Please review at your earliest opportunity, make
corrections, additions and whatever and return to me for distribution.
Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to
our
entire membership of 45 (not to those who have not signed on as members)
and to USG participants.

I guess because of the way the message was sent to me, I cannot include text 
in return, but responding to your question of what does Joe's last comment 
mean, presumably, it is that on these issues of WTO, I am not competent to 
advise you on them.  Leaving that aside, I further suspect that he sees me as 
the bette noir of the WTO ESC effort.  Finally, you might talk to Tom 
Briggs.  I think Joe has stood Tom's position on its head.  Joe has argued 
that we need to be in the ESC, because other things we care about like 
financial services regulation and e-commerce will be implicated.  He says Tom 
argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives.  As I 
understand Tom (and he can speak for himself), if we do not get energy 
services liberalised (and the exclusion of third-party access is tantamount 
to not getting energy services liberalised) then the make-weight arguments 
about e-commerce and financial services fall away, at least as 
props/arguments for continuing the ESC.    talk to you later today   mcs

Raggett intervention likely attributable to Exxon again. I warned Joe and Bob 
Fisher about their insidious influence in April when I went to Washington. 
Also at that time Bob, Chris and I talked in detail about how to get TPA onto 
agenda through a coda or ancillary agreement to basic service provision/ 
investment categorisation, as happened for telecom in GATS. Who took their

Subject: RE: Energy Services

Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that 
Joe Hillings apparently shared with him.  My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO 
initiative, I know, has hardly been masked, but, frankly, what is contained 
in the incoming letter, below, I find quite disconcerting.  I have argued 
that in our key markets, e.g., Europe, Japan, etc. (I am assuming we do not 
need it in the USA, even today) the WTO initiative, i.e., liberalisation of 
energy siervices, would be of little value by the time it was implemented.  I 
had, apparently mistakenly, at least assumed that liberalisation of energy 
siervices at a minimum meant third-party access to transmission networks.  If 
not, then what the heck are we doing in this fight.  BUT, as you will see 
from the incoming, below, when Paul Hennemeyer, of my team here in London, 
joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of 
energy services in WTO, it provoked a letter, to which Joe responded, saying 
that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid 
party access, and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position (Joe 
agreed, and said this was just an Enron company position!).  You can probably 
guess my position on this, but I thought I would forward this to you for your 
information, and, if warranted, follow up, as the conversations we have had 
have never led me to believe that either of you thought we were pursuing a 
WTO initiative which did NOT involve third party access.   thanks  mcs

Mark and Paul:   It seems that Paul's enthustastic and brilliant presentation 
may have upset a few people.  Oh dear.  If we continue to push TPA as a 
prerequisite to energy services and trading, we might jeopardise the whole 
WTO process.  Thanks.

Brian: Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue. The 
ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor 
advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a 
public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be 
practical about  the issue. I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the 
concern. It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations; I 
know it will help me.

Joe:

Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of e-mails between yourself
and Lyn, I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO.

I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and
enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC. I am sure they were also
struck, as was I, by Paul's enthusiastic explanation of the range of
innovative energy services offered by Enron. What sparked my concern was the
reference to access to energy networks.

Personally, I do not and, more importantly, nor does OGP take a position on
TPA in the EU, to which you refer in your communication. Even more so in the
context of the WTO, because it has never been discussed. I surmise though,
that other ESC members would have similar  reservations. My concerns were
heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our
interlocutors. This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and
included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched
opposition to TPA by certain network operator(s). I know not whom.

I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services,
supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA , to
either nationally or privately owned networks, to which some WTO governments
outside Europe and the United States, maybe opposed.

While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked, I don't think
that the baby was thrown away with the bath-water. It is my view, however,
that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some
governments  may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable
agenda, and to which, rightly or wrongly, they have antipathy.  My concern
is that this may then  be used to forestall  the worthy and, perhaps, more
achievable objectives of  the ESC to include  the wide range of services
advocated, in the main, by Paul and by the others who presented.

I  most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope
this helps.

I am not sure at this point whether I will be available to join you in
London but I am planning to attend the  conference on November 27 and I look
forward to meeting you and Bob once again.

Kind regards,

Brian

 Lynn: Thank you for your response. Bob Fisher and I look forward to
meeting
 you, Brian Raggett and possibly others in London on Friday, December
1. We
 will be pleased to host lunch and would be grateful if you could
select the
 restaurant. Should another time be more convenient with you, please
let me
 know.

 From your response regarding the comment in Geneva, I am not feeling
that I
 addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging
the
 pain I'll make another stab at a response. If the concern centers on
 liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural
gas, I
 would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas
 directives fully implemented. The EU had asked member countries to
fully
 implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a
phased in
 approach. Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes
energy
 services possible, some to a less degree and so far, France has not
adopted
 the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the
EU.

 The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad
goal of
 the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position
that has
 to be negotiated. We have not recommended any specific regulatory
system or
 regime.

 If I am still missing your concern, please bear with me and bring me
in
 closer to any concern that you may have.

 Regards and best wishes.

 Joe

 Joe,
      I am sorry that you were unable to telephone but I know the
reason.
 Our system has been down for upgrading. We had to expand our
bandwidth to
 accommodate the modern volume of email telephone line traffic.
Sorry.
      In response to your itinerary, I will be in town on Dec 1. I
will
 ask Brian Raggett to join us if he can and we can see if there is
any one
 else. The issue that arose at the last meeting in Geneva seems to
center
 around the special problems  of inclusion of pipelines and
electrical lines
 as part of energy services.
      Brian Raggett was at the Geneva meeting and has a first hand
 interpretation of the meeting.

 Lynn: I have been unable to get through on your telephone line this
morning
 so will attempt to fax this and accompanying message to you as
recommended
 by Brian Petty.

 If it is not fully responsive to the questions raised regarding our
 presentation to the WTO in Geneva, please feel free to contact me.
Neither
 the ESC nor Enron advocates any abregation of contract. Further, the
ESC
 has not specifically advocated any regulatory system and has no
plans to do
 so. We do advocate and advance as much market access as we can get
for
 companies providing energy services.

 Bob Fisher (Hills and Company) and I plan to be in Brussels for the
 European Services Federation conference on Monday, November 27th and
I have
 been invited to partipate on a panel which I have accepted.  Bob and
I are
 then planning to travel to Germany, Oslo and London to meet with any
energy
