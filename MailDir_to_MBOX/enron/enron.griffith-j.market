Hi All,

I recently made a change to VolSmile.xls  to pick up the NT username versus the application(excel) username.  This change will not effect the functionalities of VolSmile.  I have deleted the User Name and Password in Sheets("Skew4"), since you will not need to enter a username/password.  The code will check your read/write access against your NT username.  Once again, the change will not effect any of VolSmile's original functionalilties.  Please refer to the attach file for usage.  If anyone has questions/comments concerning this change, please let me know.

John,

I am attaching a spreadsheet that outlines the exponential volatility concept we talked about yesterday. Paulo and I will give you a call after 3:00 PM, as we also have an short excerpt from a book that deals with this in a little more depth - you might be interested in reading it.

Tom

I think Zimin has been hanging around the "phull volume" guy to much.  I think what he is trying to say is that you are calculating the historical vol correctly but to compare this (historical vol) to an implied vol from either the marketplace or as calculated by yourself, there will be an underlying assumption of a calendar year as the basis for option maturity. Therefore you would have to use the sqrt of 365.25 in order to make a comparison to the historical vol.

Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week

We did the following with KCS Energy yesterday:

We bought a Apr02/Oct02 NYmex swap at 4.02 for 10,000 mmbtu/d, setle last day.
If any month settles below $2.50, there is no payment due KCS for that reference month. Effectively the quantity becomes zero. above $2.50 it behaves like a regular swap.

this transactions should be booked from a risk perspective as three separate pieces:

1) We buy from KCS a regular Apr02/Oct02 swap @4.02, 10,000/d

2). We buy from KCS an Apr02/Oct02 Nymex put struck at $2.50, settling last day, 10,000/d, zero premium.

3). We buy from KCS an Apr02/Oct02 digital option that results in a payout to Enron of $1.52 if the reference month settles below $2.50, 10,000/d, last day, zero premium.


Against this trade:

I sold an Apr02/Oct02 swap to John Arnold @3.81

I sold an Apr02/Oct02 $2.50 put to Maggi for $.07 last day.

I will hold the digitals which I will atttach a model using exotica add-ins to value.


please try to get this in my P/L tonight.

John,

Research has delivered the lookback model with fixed strike. The path is: o:\research\custom\xfxlkbk

You will find the model and the .xll that we will have to install in order to run the model. The payout for the put = MAX(K-F(T), 0) where F(T) is the daily closing of NYMEX prompt month. 

I'll also test the model and will call you later.

Thanks.

Santiago

the trade we have done in NG (based on the old gold trade) was
as follows:

i buy winter 03/04 forward implied volatility at x% (fixed rate)

we agree on x% today and on 02/25/03 you deliver to me the ATMF
straddle on X3-H4 priced at x%.  I can hit your bid for the
straddle (at your bid vol) or take delivery.

x% is a function of the swaption vol (02/25/03 expiry on the X3-
H4 swap) and the X3-H4 term vol.  variances are additive, so:

we did the trade now for the winter 2 years hence. numbers
looked more compelling.  we also put on some short positions in
callspreads and putspreads which we did when winter 03 was at
$4.  that was the biggest winner so far.

SHORT CALL AND PUT SPREADS FOR WINTER03-04 OR CLOSER IN TERM?

out there in 03/04.  low delta, but they were low risk too.
total luck with the timing.  we did it last thursday before the
first rumors of an aga revision came out...

well, long vol via the FRA trade, and short delta via the cs/ps
 (we bot putspreads, sold callspreads).  the cs/ps were done
due to the correlation of vol and price.  we figured taht if
price went down, our fra vol would end up low, so we bot
putspreads.  on the flipside, if gas traded $6, it's safe to
say our fra vol would be a lot higher, and we wouldn't mind
paying out under the 5/6 callsrpead.

John,

The reason they are high is because they are not population weighted.  This makes a significant difference, looking at 10 cities at 100% versus population weighted, where all of the cities in a region add up to 100%.

If you would like me to weight them, it would not be a problem.

Sachin

Sachin,

These HDD's look a little too high.  I pulled just 5 cities and they are more than the spreadsheet that you prepared for the fundy's site.  Could you look at them to verify.  Thanks.

Weather Headlines
Monday November 26, 2001


*** Battle continues between Atlantic Ridge and arctic air. The result is a
much stormier pattern for the nation. ***

     The models may still be having problems in timing delivery of arctic
air to the Lower 48, but seem to be doing very well with the increased
storminess. A significant winter storm is in progress for the North with
the Dakota's and Minnesota in line for possible blizzard conditions into
midweek. The Gulf of Mexico opens up for some rain to the South.
Eventually, t-storms and possible severe weather may occur over the SE.
While this occurs, another strong storm slams into the West with more heavy
rain and snow for the region. The Atlantic ridge holds sway over the East
coast and will only grudgingly give way to the onslaught of storms coming
in from the West. We have clearly gone to a winter pattern now in the short
term for the North and West, but it is less clear for the South and East.

     There is no denying the buildup of Arctic air in Canada, whether it
drops South in the 6-10 day forecast time frame is another matter. The
European seems to be the most consistent model in recent days and it does
drop below normal temps in to the Plains and Great Lakes. But, the SE US
ridge is still around as well. My feeling right now is that sustainable
cold in this period will have a tough time moving East. The current
storminess will not be as strong this period, but does not disappear
either. Given that, I look for an above normal period for temperatures in
the South and East and a bit below normal for the North and West.

 For the period Monday November 26 through Friday November 30, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 6 below normal: California, Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Rocks, Plains?

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi valley,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Gulf Coast?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast?

Notice # 01-162
May 11, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions

DATE:          May 11, 2001
===========================================================
Reminder
Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End
of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14,
2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading
range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following
ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month
(provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum
permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):
Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

Clarification
Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the
close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible
to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above,
the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an
expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the
following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded
during a post-close session (on any day of the week):

1.   Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading
in the post-close.

2.   If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session,
it may not be traded during the post-close.

3.   It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the
RTH session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Since there will be no Mark Report today (due to the fact I need to catch a plane), The AGA number today was an injection of 15 BCF, with a revision from last week of +10 BCF to bring the total storage to 3.132 TCF or 484 BCF above last year and 313 BCF above the 5 yr average.

Have a great Thanksgiving! See ya Monday!

There are two correlation calculators that are now available in O:\Research\Custom\CorrelMatrix\.

CorrelAnalysis.xls can basket up to 3 curves and calculates the correlation matrix on contracts with different expirations.  This is particularly helpful when the correlation matrix is needed for NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

CorrelVolCalc.xls calculates the correlation between two baskets.  It can basket up to 3 curves in each basket, so this calculator is also able to handle NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

These calculators have been reviewed by the Research Group, and we feel that they are accurate.  Please let me (x53240) or Paulo Issler (x56274) know if you find any problems or have any questions about these new tools.

Thanks,
Heather Johnson

Weather Headlines
Monday October 29, 2001

     *** Pacific air to overwhelm most of the country this week with a lack
of significant storminess. There may however be some late season
percolation in the tropics.***

     For the third time this month, we set a handful of record lows in the
SE U.S. this weekend. The Canadian high is moving toward the coast though
and we should soon initiate a broad (though light) SW flow of air that will
warm the East back to above normal levels. This is already well under way
in the Plains where 70's were common this weekend. This pattern shuts off
the Gulf of Mexico and allows for mainly dry frontal passages. One such
front in the Plains will shift to the NE through Wednesday. Since we have a
zonal flow developing in the upper levels, this front does little more than
slow down the warm up as opposed to stopping it all together. Storms are a
little more robust in the Pacific NW as a deep trough in the Gulf of Alaska
continues to send impulses of energy your way. Some precip should get as
far South as Northern California. With no additional arctic air in sight
this week, most five day averages return to above seasonal norms.

     The most excitement for weather fanatics this week may be late season
development in the tropics. We have a tropical depression in the Central
Atlantic now and satellite pictures suggest another one may be developing
over the next 24 hours in the Caribbean off the coast of Nicaragua. My
initial thought was its a little too far South and too close to land to
really have an impact in the Gulf and SE. However, there is considerable
forecast scatter among the models. It runs anywhere from nothing at all to
development in the Gulf of Mexico. So, I wont rule it out yet, but since it
would be days away and not even developed yet, I'll wait a couple of days
before issuing a prediction.

     Last week 6-10 day forecasts from the models were largely in agreement
and so far have been mostly on the money. Given the pattern though, I would
have expected this to be the case. The next change in weather will likely
not be so agreed upon and there is already some scatter in the models. My
early expectations are for another buckle to take place in the jet stream
over the Eastern U.S. early in this period. Some keep things zonal, but you
certainly can't argue the trend so far this fall is for this to occur about
every seven days. But, there is reason to think the Eastern trough will not
be as robust as the last several. In other words, it won't be as cold or
spread as far South or West. If it goes this way, we would turn slightly
below normal East, a little above in the West and a little of both (or
normal) in the Plains.

For the period Monday October 29  through Tuesday November 2, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Southeast, Gulf Coast?

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Pacific NW,
Northern California...

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern California, Great Lakes, Ohio
and Mississippi Valleys?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Most of the Plains and Rockies,
Intermountain West, Desert SW?

John & Santiago,

Per our conversation, the lookback option you need is a fixed strike option. 
For put it pays    

   max(K-min(S),0)

The model in option library is for floating strike, for put it pays 
max(max(S)-S(T),0).  

So please hold on the number.  Paulo will work on a correct model and
hopefully give you the answer tomorrow.

Zimin

Weather Headlines
Friday October 26, 2001

     ***Cold air in the East will linger through the weekend but will get
rapidly scoured out next week. Next trough set to enter the Western U.S.***

     There is currently a long and strong fetch of NW winds driving cold
air through the Plains and then South and East. Some Lake effect snows are
occurring with this as well though much of the Great Lakes moisture is a
cold rain. Sprawling high pressure covers almost the rest of the country
and the trend in temperature is about to become one of moderation. The
surface high in the Plains will shift to the East coast by early next week
and the NW winds now will shift to the SW allowing the warm up to commence.
It will start in the Plains this weekend and go East of the Mississippi by
Monday. My five day temperature departures are still largely below normal,
but they should be used with caution in a see-saw pattern such as this.
After all some areas(especially in the Plains) may start out 15-20 below
normal today and go 10-15 above normal by Day 5 (Tuesday). By the end of
the period, the Eastern trough will be out to sea, a new trough will invade
the West and Pacific style air will rule coast to coast. That air can be
damp along the West coast, but as it sinks over the mountains it quickly
warms up and dries out. This pattern is allowing the wet season to get
started in the PNW. It appears each successive Pacific storm is getting a
little stronger and forming further South. If the trend continues, we could
start seeing moisture getting into Northern California next week.

     I continue to see good agreement with the models in the 6-10 day
period. The country should remain bathed in Pacific air well into the first
week of November and I believe even beyond. Troughs continue to move into
the West and then in a progressive pattern stay fairly weak in their move
East. Without any blocking in Canada, it is hard for me to see much
likelihood for any arctic air to get entrained. My confidence remains high
in a largely above normal temperature forecast. It is a little less
optimistic in terms of precipitation. I question how much Gulf of Mexico
moisture can be worked back to the North, but some models suggest the
Plains could get wet next week. I have not discussed the tropics much this
week because there has not been a storm to mention. There still isn't, but
the overall pattern we are going into next week can in a climatological
sense sometimes crank something up in the Caribbean and push it North
towards Florida. My guess is there will not be a named storm as such, but
some potential for heavy rain.

For the period Friday October 26 through Tuesday October 30, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 7 to 9-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, Southeast...

Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Northeast, Mississippi
Valley

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Plains,  Pacific NW...

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: California, Rockies...

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Intermountain West...

John,


For a down and out put, I put the following as an approximation for our understanding purpose.

a down and out put with barrier B < strike K
is overestimated by

A put at struck at K - a put struck at B - (K-B)*digital put strike at B.

I ploted the barrier put (blue line)  versus the approximation (red line) as function of the 
barrier.  

The true barrier option has zero payoff whenever there is a touch down the barrier
during the lifetime of the option.  Therefore it goes to zero much faster than
above approximation when B -> K.

See the spreadsheet for more details.

Zimin

Weather Headlines
Monday February 4, 2002
Pattern has a colder look to it this morning, while the Southern storm
track shows signs of action. Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to
reload to the Northwest.
This may be the first time this winter a forecast understates the cold
rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the snowcover in the
Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European enough credit for
its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its transient though
with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day numbers taken as
a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many ways, this will
be similar to what happened in late December with the largest departures
from normal in the South. That will be due more from an active storm track
rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of southern storms,
we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northern Texas today.
This system will bring rain to much of the old South the next couple of
days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later in the week
which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on the next
system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. While its
turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the West. That
does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is trapped in
much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to scour this
out. A gradual moderation may occur, but it still looks below normal.
The main stories in the 6-10 day period is whether or not the storminess of
the European models and the cold showing up in the Canadian verify. The
most extreme solution obviously would be a combination of the two, but that
seems unlikely given the results of this winter so far. Of the two, I give
the storm proposition the most weight. It is possible the East coast could
see a sizeable snow out of all of this. As for the cold, the Canadian since
the middle of last week has been rebuilding pressures in the NW
territories. They become quite high this period, but are still North of the
border. It once again becomes a wait and see game to see if some of this
real arctic air can come down. That, I am not ready yet to commit to.
However, the overall pattern certainly looks colder than January did and
for many could run below normal this period.
For the period Monday February 4 through Friday February 8, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West ...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Desert SW, California, Gulf Coast,
Southeast, Northeast...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys, Mid-Atlantic, Rockies, Southern Plains..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Plains...

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Hi John,

I've attached workbooks that compare implied volatility from market data to ENA curves for June, October, December contracts.  But I'm not sure that I have the most current skew table.  For the attached workbooks I just took last months table and rolled the contracts up a month, so what was May-01 became June-01, etc.  Have you made any other adjustments to the skew table? 

I'd be happy to come up and talk about these files with you if you want?  
Thanks.
ken

Weather Headlines
Tuesday November 27, 2001

*** Very stormy pattern for the next few days as Canadian cold interacts
with Atlantic warmth. ***

     A series of strong storms are expected to run through the Continental
U.S. during the five-day period. One has already produced heavy snows in
the Northern Plains and is producing another round of strong t-storms along
the Gulf coast. The cold air has pushed far enough South through the Plains
to produce some snows into Northern Texas today. This cold is having a
difficult time pushing east thanks to a strong SE U.S. ridge. There will be
somewhat of an eastern push later in the week, but with a sizeable
weakening as it occurs. The next in the series of storms for the West mid
to late week appears to be a powerhouse. Rain along the coast will be
measured in inches (primarily from San Francisco North), mountain snows
will be in feet and all of this will be accompanied by strong winds. The
deep trough in the West will keep temperatures all through the region below
to much below normal. The extreme East remains above seasonal norms while
the rest of the country sees a fair amount of fluctuation on daily
temperatures depending upon their location in respect to these storms.

     The 6-10 day period it is safe to say will be less active than the
short range. That's not much of a stretch though given the magnitude of
short-term storms. The overall pattern does not change much with some
degree of trough still expected in the West. We will probably beat down the
SE ridge somewhat this period. It still looks doubtful to me that we would
see any sustainable cold air very far South into the U.S. In fact, the
trend in the arctic regions appears to be one of cooling during this
period. Typically when this happens, the result is one of warming in the
Southern half of Canada. I don't see a major warm up and in fact many areas
of the Lower 48 will be cooler than recent weeks. However, in a relative to
normal sense, I anticipate most areas to run near or slightly above normal
through the first week of December.

For the period Tuesday November 27 through Saturday December 1, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 9 below normal: California, Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Rockies, Plains?

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi valley,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Gulf Coast?

Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast?

I finished a spreadsheet for calculating historical correlations on forward curves. It gives the correlation matrix for contracts going out an arbritary number of months out. I think it might be a handy tool for some of you.

You may get that on O:\RESEARCH\CUSTOM\CORRELMATRIX\

It demands that you have access to our EGSPROD32 database. You must have that configured in your ODBC. It is a large spreadsheet, so it may take some computing resorces. Let me know if you find any problem.

Thanks.

John:

Here is the spreadsheet for valuing and hedging the quanto swap. It prices the swap for one day. Please note the delta position on gas that needs to be taken since inception. The gas position changes as we enter into the correlated period (hit F9 to see different scenarios). 

For the sake of simplicity I used a zero interest rate (that does not change the hedging issues). "TS" is the ticker size (MMBTUs/HDDs). I made it the unit for simplicity also. 

 
Let me know your questions and opinion.
Paulo Issler

John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use=
 252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.=20

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calenda=
r Days (=3D Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the E=
IMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.=20

Zimin

Zimin,

I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been calcula=
ting historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log=
 returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily volatility) =
and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up wi=
th an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I have been u=
sing is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am trying to=
 do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to the im=
plied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied volat=
ilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote and I=
 iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I also =
look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day conv=
ention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a compar=
able historical volatility number I need to use 365.25 to convert the daily=
 historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

Thanks again for your help.

John Griffith

Weather Headlines
Wednesday November 21, 2001

*** Battle develops between tropical ridge in the Atlantic and Arctic air
flooding Canada. The Atlantic ridge will prevail? for now.***

     A series of weather systems will move into the West Coast and head
East through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. While the pattern will be
more active than recent weeks, no one big storm is likely to bring travel
problems on a large scale. In addition, there is little additional cold air
available to spin up a Winter Storm, so most precip will be in the form of
light to moderate rain. Exceptions to this will be the mountains of the
West where ski resort snows will fall. Also, the far Northern reaches of
the U.S. could see some light snows. Temperature departures are expected to
go largely above normal again with the highest numbers in the North, though
not to the degree of earlier in the month. Negative numbers though not
significant are confined to the West where storms come in off the ocean and
in the Southeast where this time of year is not cold anyway.

     Models are going wild with a winter storm early in the 6-10 day
period. I suspect surface pressures are a little overdone given the upper
level flow. However, the Gulf will be open and some significant moisture
and wind are possible. The storm track will be well North which confines
snow to the Northern U.S. Significant winter weather though from Wyoming to
Minnesota is possible. The large scale pattern ending November will be for
a trough to sit in the Interior West while a strong ridge exists over the
Southeast.  There is still plenty of arctic air available in Canada, but
with the jet stream in a broad West to SW flow, no means of delivery appear
available until at least December 1'st. In a general sense, I look for
temperatures to be below normal in the West with above normal in the South
and East. The North is somewhat a question mark being closer to the arctic
air and could go either way. I'll lean to normal for now.

For the period Wednesday November 21 through Sunday November 25, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, Great
Lakes, Southern Plains, California, Desert SW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Rockies, Intermountain West, Central
Plains?

Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal:  Northern Plains?

Weather Headlines
Monday November 19, 2001

*** Much colder air now in the Plains will translate East. Zonal flow my
midweek will modify the effects. Legitimate arctic air starts to pool in
Western Canada late next week.***

     Last weeks triple digit above normal readings are a thing of the past
as a strong cold front has moved through the Plains. Temperatures in the
teens and 20's are common there this morning. It is colder, I grant you,
but my fears of not seeing any real arctic air in this have turned out to
be correct. In fact, a return to zonal flow is expected before the end of
the week and another warm up commences. Now, the jet stream is suppressed
farther South, so we won't see a return to the previous 2 weeks warmth.
However, a return to slightly above normal is possible late in the 5 day
period so temperature departures this week are not that significant. This
of course is an important travel week due to the holiday. I do not see a
major storm in the immediate horizon. The current Eastern front does have
some moisture with it. Showers have broken out ahead of it and eventually
some Lake Effect snows could occur tomorrow and Wednesday. The West coast
has some rain this morning, but this storm should weaken inland and no
major temperature trend changes are seen in the short range for this area.

     I am still not expecting any major arctic out breaks in the 6-10 day
period, but hemispheric changes during the period may well spell an arctic
outbreak going into early December.  It will be interesting to see if
arctic air now forecast to pool in Western Canada next week materializes at
the expected rate and intensity. Assuming it does, then a SE spreading is
due just outside this period. But, before that happens inside this period,
models are leaning towards a significant storm forming in the SW and
heading towards the Great Lakes.  Overall, temperatures may return to above
normal in the East ahead of this feature. The West may go below normal in
response to the deep trough if in fact it materializes.

For the period Monday November 19 through Friday November 23, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 4 to 6- degrees below normal: Central and Southern Plains, Gulf

While  markets  digest  the  impact of the ECB's surprising, but apparently
credibility  damaging  interest rate cut on both European asset markets and
the  euro,  the  Fed  will  rub salt into the wounds this week with another
aggressive  ease  in  policy. Although this may be the last ease this year,
recent  market  moves suggest that the Fed has done enough to support hopes
of  a  recovery  in  H2.  The ECB in contrast, by last week's price action,
still  has  some  way  to go, leaving EUR/USD vulnerable to new lows in the
very short term.

John,

This is the latest skew calculator file.  It has a sheet for the vol skew table, and it calculates the ENA pdf using a linear interpolation between points on the table, not a polynomial.  

The file shows yesterday's settle data for Jun, and ENA data matches very well.  (All the 2001 contracts agree closely with ENA data from yesterday, in fact.)  I've added a macro that fetches the underlying price, volatility, and interest rate from our in-house EGSPROD32 database.  Let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Feel free to contact any of us if you have any questions or requests regarding this file.  hope it is helpful.

ken

Weather Headlines
Tuesday February 5, 2002
There is still no true arctic air in the pattern, but the Southern jet
stream is active for storms and the trend is certainly colder than recent
weeks.
We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last month.
January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable warmth in
the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record breaking
cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal over
the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I still
don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a "cold and
stormy" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this
morning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas
today with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast
through Thursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see
some light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker.
This should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The
coldest of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now.
This should start modifying although only in a gradual sense through the
rest of the week.
The same threats and questions raised yesterday in the 6-10 day outlook
still apply today. The Canadian and European schemes still look sharper
with the western ridge and eastern trough than their American counterpart.
The correct forecast up to now most of the time was to go with the warmer
solution. This time I am running with the colder one. The Canadian model
has been consistent with a stronger Eastern trough since the middle of last
week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic air next week into the Eastern
U.S. The potential of some sort of East coast storm also remains in this
pattern. I am not by any means forecasting any brutal cold, but I am going
against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlooks which are above normal in
the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region will grade out slightly below
normal instead while the West is in a moderating phase.
For the period Tuesday February 5 through Saturday February 9, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Gulf Coast,
Southeast...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Desert SW, California, Northeast,
Mississippi Valley...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, Rockies, Southern Plains..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Plains...

Just received this.  

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Weather Headlines
Tuesday November 20, 2001

*** Models converging on an increasingly stormy pattern. The question still
to be answered is when the arctic air arrives.***

     The current cool down in the East is very transitional with warmer air
to return by the end of the week. The pattern has clearly changed as the
jet stream has been suppressed Southward. In the short (and medium) terms,
things should turn stormier, but not necessarily colder. In fact, latest
charts indicate a healthy ridge to build late this period over the SE U.S.
in response to a trough developing over the Rockies. This opens the Gulf of
Mexico up in a moisture sense, but any winter snows look to be confined to
the extreme Northern tier of states. Much needed rains may fall from the
Plains to the East Coast by the weekend in areas that have been parched
this Fall. In terms of temperatures, 5 day averages will not depart
significantly from normal the rest of the week though the trend late in the
period will be for a warmer East and a cooler West.

     I have been consistently forecasting colder air (along with most
others) in the 6-10 day period for a couple of weeks now. It has been slow
in developing and the cool down now in the East would hardly be considered
significant unless it is compared to the record warmth of the last couple
of weeks. The pattern I foresee going into early December is colder
relative to normal in the West and warmer in the East. Specifically a storm
track from the SW into the Plains and NE will set up allowing for generous
rain (with snow North) to develop. Arctic air is moving to this side of the
pole and pooling in NW Canada. Now, a mechanism to drive it SE is needed.
One of the tools used that I occasionally refer to is the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO).  Most winter forecasts have predicted this as largely
negative this season which is a robust signal for cold air in the East. It
has been negative the last two weeks though in fairness its reliability as
a signal gets much higher in December for cold. I find it interesting to
note the signal is expected to go weakly positive next week. Bottom line
for the period is I see a continuation of a cold bias with the Western
trough and a warm bias in the vicinity of the Eastern ridge. We may also
see a significant storm move through the country during the period, but
again I look for snow to be confined to the North.

For the period Tuesday November 20 through Saturday November 24, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, Great
Lakes, Southern Plains, Pacific NW, California?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Desert SW,  Rockies, Intermountain
West, Central and Northern Plains?

Weather Headlines
Wednesday February 6, 2002
More troughing in the East and ridging in the West. Pattern developing as
advertised, but will the cold air materialize?
The Southern stream storm track is alive and well and should continue to be
so for the next couple of weeks. All of the models point to the potential
of healthy winter storms in the midst of a warmer than normal temperature
pattern. The lack of realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again
the air simply is not that frigid. We are still below normal relative to
normal over much of the South and West. In the West, it is due to high
pressure trapped in the Intermountain region while in the South it is in
response to inclement weather along the storm track. The North and East are
back into a warming mode in spite of the fact that a trough will reform in
the East. Upstream over the Western half of Canada, it is just not that
cold anymore. The MRF is up to its old tricks of a sharp cooling "just past
this period" and the Canadian still insists on a moderate intensity high
coming down this weekend. It may well turn cooler, but certainly not in an
excessive way. The five day numbers will be warming, not cooling.
The 6-10 day period appears to be much more favorable for talk of storms
rather than any excessive cold. We are rapidly running out of time for that
as normal temperatures are now on their way up. We may not see anything
extreme, but I still see some potential for the East being slightly below
normal for the period if the Canadian is on the right track. The models do
seem to show ridging to continue out West. It has been a very slow process,
but moderation should continue.
For the period Wednesday February 6 through Sunday February 10, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California, Mississippi Valley...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Southern Plains..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Rockies, Central Plains
Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes...

months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the

Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and

the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
(5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks *

customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have

Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be

Kenneth,

Here is the trade I was looking at:

	Dec'01	trading at $4.725

		 100  4.70 Calls
		-300  5.50 Calls
		 200  5.90 Calls

		-200  3.50 Puts
		 300  4.00 Puts
		-100  4.70 Puts

Someone called a broker on the floor of the exchange to get a price on this butterfly combination. First of all, can you tell me what this trade does for you.  I looked at the payout and I don't understand what they were trying to do.  Second, the price that the floor market makers gave him was $.10 bid at $.14.  I price the deal at approximately $.07.  I know that the $.10 is too high and the delta of the trade is about .07 (really small).  How can I use your skew file to see the arbitrage?

I have attached the payout chart.


Thanks for your help.  Call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

John
