Now that the fixed price deals are working: what are we working on now?  
(Canadian counterparties I hope.)

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

The T3 new disk storage technology and new database server for TAGG/ERMS 
database were successfully implemented last weekend. No problems have been 
reported. Nagesh and Ramesh reported performance improvement of CPR and 
RisktRAC. Although users have not noticed significant improvement of the 
system, we believe that performance gain will be seen when system load is 
high and that the new disk storage technology will provide us with better 
fall-tolerance and better performance in the long run.

I want to thank everyone involved in the implementation for the good work. 
Special thanks go to Michael Barber for his sacrifice of first two days of 
his vacation to configure the new server and disk and for his excellent work 
during the implementation. Many thanks also go to the DBAs, Alex Hsieh, Brian 
Ngo, Soo-Lian Ervin and Mable Tang for their diligent work in making database 
migration and performance measurement and in making sure of a smooth database 
migration. I want to specifically thank Nagesh Kavi for his great efforts of 
coordinating all system testing among development groups. I also want to 
thank Malcolm Wells, Wilford Stevens, Terry Sanvido, Dave Commensen and Jay 
Krish for their active support during the implementation. Many thanks also go 
to the Ganapathy Ramesh, Jeremy Wong, Ed Calderon, Dave Wei, Senthil 
Mayilsamy, Narasim Kasaru, Nayan Dattani, Ron Nolte and Mike Swain for their 
hardworking in testing all applications of related systems. Special thanks 
also go to Unify team for having made the implementation by the end of year 
2000 possible by swapping the server and the new T3 disks with TAGG/ERMS and 
for their cooperation during the implementation. Last but not least, I want 
to thank Jeff Gossett, Kam Keiser, Errol Mclaughli, Michelle Bruce, Shifali 
Sharma, John Swinney and Stacey White for their efforts of performing user 
acceptance testing on the New Year Eve day.

Thanks

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Subject:	Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Subject:	RE:  ERMS discounting project

We met this morning to discuss ERMS Discounting testing.  

It was agreed that:

Jeff, Todd and Kevin will provide a listing of Friday's COB Post IDs to Jeremy/Karima by Monday noon, July 16th.
Jeremy will produce a comparison Report from the Post ID listing, comparing Gross Book Balances for current production and revised production.  This report will be available on Tuesday morning, July 17th. 
A test port calc will be available to run individual books to test both calculations against the production database, July 17th.
AA will be advised of this change once we have been able to quantify the GBB impact anticipated. 
No impact is expected in Infinity since ERMS will pass the revised settlement date with the notional cash flows.

Sheila

Scott,
This has no impact to you currenty since you are not using ERMS in production; but, we did want to make you aware of this change.

Kevin, Jeff, Todd,  

The discouting change to ERMS of moving the assumed cash flow date from the 1st of the production month to the end of the production month is in progress and targeted for production on August 1.  

IT is ready to begin user acceptance testing this week and next week.  IT is producing a spreadsheet to quantify projected calculation impact.

I will have Kelly set up a meeting for this Thursday so we can all meet with IT to discuss the testing process.  Please feel free to bring someone along who may be assisting your group with the testing process.

As discussed, no change will be done for Financial Settlements.  Both contract and calendar will continue as is with the first day of the month assumption.  The Monthly Reserve Calculation will quantify the impact to the gross book balance as if cash flows had been discounted to the correct date. 

Please do not hesitate to call with questions or suggestions.

Thanks. Sheila

systems issues from the prior night and to discuss what books were not 
officialized.  I have gone to this meeting this week, and I think that we 
should always have a representative in the meeting.  Here is what I propose:  
We alternate weeks going to this meeting.

Week of :
Dec. 4   - Jeff Gossett
Dec. 11 - Darron Giron
Dec. 18 - David Baumbach
Dec. 25 - Will Kelly
Jan. 1    -  Kam Keiser
Jan. 8    - Errol Mclaughlin

And then we will start over again.
If you can not go,  make sure that someone goes in your place.

Thanks

Irena and Elizabeth -  Can you please add these daily meetings to the 
appropriate calender?

Thanks

I would like to continue to receive an email in the morning when there is a violation.  I will make every effort to get this out by noon from now on.  Also,  in case I am not here,  I would suggest that you include the regional controllers on the emails if possible.  I appreciate your help.

Thanks,

Jeff

Thanks - in answer to your question, most groups actually get us position explanations by the start of business the next day (and that is our expectation of them).  P&L explanations are received usually by 11 (unless they have trouble finalizing their P&L).  I know it is a bit more difficult for ENA as you have to coordinate with Canada.  We need to work together to determine what the optimal process should be.  Factors to consider:

Do you know the ENA violations/notifications without us telling you or do you need us to give you the total ENA numbers (inclusive of Canada)?  My guess is that you know the position info from the benchmarks, but not the P&L.
Position violations - What is a reasonable time frame for us to expect you to give us the explanations (considering you have to coordinate with Canada who is 1 hr behind)? 
Var violations - What is a reasonable time frame for us to expect you to give us the explanations (considering you have to coordinate with Canada who is 1 hr behind)? 
Notifications - What is a reasonable time frame for us to expect you to give us the explanations (considering you have to coordinate with Canada who is 1 hr behind)? 

Considering the above, would requiring information by noon for ENA be reasonable?

Regards,

Shona

This is what I sent Kenneth yesterday.  I have a read receipt of 3:43.  Not sure how he did not get it.  This is bidweek and quarter end, so if you expect them by a certain time someone needs to communicate that.

In English this means that even if a book has no positions or value,  if it 
has any deals with a counterparty it needs to be officialized so that credit 
can calculate margin.

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Subject: Change to ENA/EES Deals

Can the following deals be rebooked using the current intercompany 
methodology:

 Buyer = Enron Energy Services
 Seller = Enron North America (or RMT if these are all financial)

Then what is now the counterparties on the deal will become the books. 

These are the only deals that are left that are booked the old way.  I was  
hoping to make things consistent.  Two of the deals (EH1958.1, EH4242.5) will 
roll off the end of May -the others have months to go.

Thanks for the help

Subject:	Houston Excel Spreadsheet change for Counterparty Identification

All,
We are in the process of changing the Houston Based Excel Spreadsheets to require the use of the Global Counterparty ID (which is a number) instead of the ERMS Shortcode (also known as CP Code, or shortname) which is a legacy based identifier.  This will alleviate the unmatched exposure problem that we currently have in CAS and also get us going in the direction we have always wanted to go (being globally compliant in the data we receive).

Therefore, we are currently changing the spreadsheet template so that the spreadsheet will require the duns_link_id of the internal and external counterparties instead of the short codes which are currently used.  Wei Hu is modifying the spreadsheet table structure to handle this change.  We will provide someone to assist in the initial population of the CP_IDs and we will be working with the users to test the change and move the loader to production.

Once in production, the book administrators will have to obtain the GCP CP ID for these two columns.  My suggestion is to have them get accounts to view the Global CP application where they can see the duns_link_ids, names, etc.   Who can provide a listing of all the people that will need access to the GCP application?

Once this is in place, then we will look into turning on the validation requirement that does not allow the spreadsheet to be submitted until the various validations (of which IDs are one) have been passed.

We will provide a template early next week to some group of users so we can begin testing by mid to late next week.  Moving to production will happen soon thereafter.

Any concerns or issues? 

Thanks
John

Subject: To Ops - Revised February BOD Approved Risk Management Policy

Attached is the revised Risk Management Policy incorporating the BOD's 
changes - please discard the previously circulated version I sent out prior 
to the BOD meeting.  I've also included a recap of substantive changes since 
the October 2000 version that was circulated to you in conjuction with the 
compliance certificates last fall, but you should read the policy to enhance 
your understanding, and distribute it to your groups as some changes are 
significant and are detailed further in the policy.  I did notify the Office 
of the Chair for each of your business units of these changes earlier this 
week, and I will also provide them with a copy of the revised policy.  


If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call at x 30429.

These should work just like the broker deals . There will be an EOL report that will list the origination that needs to be picked up from the trading desk. We apologise for not letting you'll know before this was released. However no mid-marketers have been set up yet and are not likely to be set up or start trading for at least 10 days. We have a training session for Mid-Marketers in 27 C2 tomorrow 8/23/01 at 4p.m. to discuss the funs=ctionality. If it will help please feel free to attend or have one of your people attend. We can also set up a sparate meeting asap to discuss this. Thanks.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.


It sure would be nice to know about these things in the future.  How is this going to work?  How will we pick up the orig?  As you know,  the system does not calculate orig.  What about the controls issues related to EOL confirms going out on originated deals?

Subject:	Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information (dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

Can the following deals be rebooked using the current intercompany methodology:

	Buyer = Enron Energy Services
	Seller = Enron North America (or RMT if these are all financial)

Then what is now the counterparties on the deal will become the books. 

These are the only deals that are left that are booked the old way.  I was  hoping to make things consistent.  Two of the deals (EH1958.1, EH4242.5) will roll off the end of May -the others have months to go.

Thanks for the help

Jeff,

The two NG-Price books were added per John's requeset, but have no trades in them.  I have changed their status to inactive.  The FT-Transport-Basis is an excel spreadsheet (according to the rac website), but I don't know why it is showing up under our desk -- I am calling Chris Abel to find out why.  In the interim I have changed the status to inactive.  I am checking on the books under Kori's name, but preliminarily it looks like there are no deals nor post id's for them, so I have changed there status to inactive.  I will keep you updated with anything else I find.

Thanks,

Errol

The listed books are all showing an Active status on the website, but do not have post id's for the 1st.  Could you please do one of two things: 1)Change the status to Inactive or Archive, if the books do not have any trades  or 2) if they should be officialized and should have a post id, work with Burton's group to resolve the issue.

We will be reporting on a daily basis all active books that did not have a post id show up on the website.  Therefore please manage the status of these books accordingly.  

If you have any questions about the website, please contact Chris, Burton, Jennifer, Susan or myself.

Thanks,

Subject: requests for new curves, new books, porfolio changes

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: daily reporting to Rick Buy

Rick Buy has requested that he receive the log of the book officialization 
errors on a daily basis.  Previously, he was only receiving it weekly.  
Because of this change, it will be necessary for risk contols to have a 
complete explanation from your risk groups as to why errors happened.  

The current process is as follows for Houston (using Houston time):
Books officialized in evening by risk management
7:30 am risk controls receives error listing (books which did not make it to 
RisktRAC)
7:30 - 8:30 explanations obtained for error received from risk management 
(Not all explanations are obtained by 8:30)
8:30 meeting to discuss previous night's officialization process and general 
processes
9:00 close obtain explanations not obtained before meeting
Wed pm - weekly consolidated report sent to business controllers and RAC

The process needs to change so that we receive all explanations before the 
8:30 meeting.  I know that many groups identify errors the night before via 
the benchmark or reviews of RisktRAC.  Hopefully, all groups are moving in 
this direction.  Since the log will go out each day, each of you need to look 
at the current process you have in place and determine how you can get us the 
information prior to the 8:30 meeting.

We are trying to put the following process in place (for Houston):
Books officialized in evening by risk management including risk management 
ensuring RisktRAC has all required information, errors noted and an e-mail 
sent to risk controls
7:30 am risk controls receives error listing (books which did not make it to 
RisktRAC)
7:30 - 8:30 explanations obtained for error received from risk management (if 
not received the night before) and log updated
8:30 meeting to discuss previous night's officialization process and general 
processes
Log sent to bus. controllers, RAC - daily

Note:  I know that London, Sydney, and Japan have different processes.  We 
have to work with your current processes to ensure that risk controls 
receives info on time.

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

It does more harm than good to just do the one leg.  We are currently 
settling all of these deals incorrectly b/c they are pointing to the Houston 
office instead of Calgary.  Please let me know if there is anything that I 
can do to make sure this happens more quickly.

Thanks

  I can make the list of counterparties used by the bridge database driven, 
and have it maintainable via the Tagg maintenance program. Currently, the 
bridge only does the first part of the deal. Flipping out the deal between 
ENA and ECC has to be done manually. Because we're currently making a number 
of changes to the bridge already, and I have other commitments, I'm loathe to 
tackle automating the second leg until sometime after January.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Today we had a meeting where we discussed, among other things, what some of the improvements to the risk analytics being done within Global Risk Operations ("Energy Ops") should be.  For those of you who could not attend today's meeting, there is an additional meeting scheduled for next Monday.

As a result of previous risk/RAC meetings, task forces to address the following are being set up.  I have chosen four key areas that address our largest concerns.  We are looking for 4-5 people on a task force and each of you should either be on a task force or elect a manager or above representative from your group to sit on a task force.

Please let me know by Wednesday which task force you would like to be assigned to.  I will then compile the information and get back to you with all of the team members for each task force.

Task forces needed:

Curve validations & correlation factors, & conversion factors- we need to look at tools, resources, methodologies etc.  The goal is to roll out to the individual risk groups a standard curve methodology and a tool to perform the validations.
Members to date: Tom Victorio, Jeff Gossett
Date to have methodology & tools rolled out: Aug 30

Stress testing and Scenario Analysis - The goal is to determine if standard scenarios should be developed, how this testing/analytics should be performed, and what tools should be used to do it.
Date to determine how these stress testing & scenario analysis should be performed Aug 30.  To be implemented on test basis - end of Q3, to be fully implemented Oct 30.

VAR - currently the calcs are not clearly understood by all risk groups.  This task force would be responsible for defining roles and responsibilities for VAR and work with RAC to develop training courses on "ENRON VAR".
Members to date: Sheila Glover
Date to have classes scheduled & roles & responsibilities determined: Sept 30

Models - We have developed a good tool to identify valuation profit and loss models "exotic spreadsheets" within RisktRAC and are now in the process of putting together review standards for these models.  The goal of this task force is to implement an agreed upon review standard for all models.
Members to date: Nancy Hernandez
Date to have review & approval process in place Sept 30

Subject: ERMS Bridge Programming Guidelines


In order to protect the integrity of TAGG production bridging logic and better facilitate development and improvements to EOL bridge functionality, the ERMS IT team has set forth some guidelines for the processing and prioritization of bridging development requests. These guidelines should assist both Risk Management and Commercial in gaining resolution on critical bridging issues while protecting against the implementation of faulty or untested logic.
 
The new process flow for ERMS bridging requests and corrections is as follows:
 
1) All requests for bridge logic corrections and enhancements will need to be forwarded by email through the EOL Product Control Group and should be prioritized as either "Immediate" or "standard". "Immediates" are emergency requests for which other programming efforts being made by the ERMS IT team will be placed on hold, while "standard" requests will be placed on ERMS's developmental time-table in the order received.
 
    ** Note: Tara Sweitzer will be sending a supplemental email to the various Risk groups of current programming issues for prioritization.
 
2) Once received, developmental requests will be evaluated by the ERMS IT team. The programmers responsible for logic implementation will then assign an estimated completion date, which PCG will forward back to the appropriate Risk Desk. Any system issues, emergency requests or other subsequent developments which may impact this due date will be communicated to the appropriate Risk group by PCG.
 
3) Upon completion of testing, the ERMS IT team will load new logic enhancements and fixes into the production environment. These uploads will take place each Friday evening, except in the case of emergency requests, which may be uploaded at any time. This standardized weekend upload will correspond with the weekly EOL application enhancement uploads.
 
Please feel free to contact either myself or Tara Sweitzer if you have any questions regarding the new development request procedures.
 
Thank you,

Subject:	Projected effect on US books from Project Slapshot

Jeff, here is a projection of the effect of the deals we are going to unwind on the Houston books.  These amounts will be offset by an annuity for the same amount payable to each of the books, to be settled in June.

Let me or Morris know if you have any questions - we will be unwinding these trades over the weekend, so that all of the effect will be in for Monday morning.  Let me know if there is additional co-ordination you want me to do with your book runners.  Also, I will send you a final list of deals and values by book tonight.

Note that the full spreadsheet where this is analyzed is on the Houston shared drive, at O:/_Dropbox/BGillis/ENA_Exposure_Jun20_01.xls, and look at the Latest List of Deals tab (watch that you don't accidentally get the $CAD file I put out in the same directory for the currency group).

Jeff - call me when you get  a minute regarding this.  Torrey is absolutely 
correct - our traders have been instructed not to allow customers out of a 
trade without doing an OTC trade or having legal prepare a termination 
agreement.  Sounds like it is time to send out the policy again!

Jeff-

>From a legal perspective, the traders are not supposed to have the authority 
to let out another entity from an EnronOnline trade. If the trade is the 
result of a system malfunction or some other uncontrollable issue, the 
customer can get with the trader and agree to reverse out an existing EOL 
transaction with an OTC trade, but Commercial should not be letting customers 
out of EOL deals simply because their traders "clicked on the wrong product". 
This is the policy that Mark Taylor and Legal have had in place since the 
inception of EOL.

I'll get with Sheri and Jennifer and we will see what Legal has to say, but, 
if Mike Maggi and/or John Arnold have been verbally allowing customers to 
change these Gas Daily trades in the past, it definitely creates a problem 
from the perspective of trying to hold them to the same trades now. The best 
advise I can give right now is to make sure that John and Mike do not 
continue allowing customers out of their trades simply because they "clicked 
on the wrong product". The legal responsibility for "clicking on the right 
product" lies firmly with the customer and whenever Commercial starts 
allowing them out of that responsibility it can create serious legal problems 
when and if one of these trades comes back to bite them.

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

Torrey - 

We have an issue where some of our traders are letting traders out of EOL 
deals b/c they "clicked on the wrong product."  What happens is we end up 
having two deals in our systems,  and the counterparty has no deals in their 
system.  So when settlement goes out they tend to accept the one in their 
favor and reject the one against them.  We always work it out but as you can 
imagine it is a huge headache from everyone's perspective.  Please advise on 
what we can do to put an end to this practice.

Thanks

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

In order to prepare the FRED files for March 2001 we need to have the flash detail saved to the following directory ASAP:

If detail is not in the directory by end of day Thursday we will prepare the FRED files accordingly.  Thanks for your help.

This is great information.  However,  without knowing who entered the deals 
there is little we can do to fix this.  ie.  Is it a trader?  Which book 
admin is it?  Can you get names of the person entering the deals on the 
report?  And do you put every deal that has to be changed on this report?  Or 
just the deals that are in wrong for more than a certain time period?  I 
would caution if you are putting every deal that changes into this report you 
might want to change your practice, as now that the traders have TDS they 
tend to want to see the economic impact ASAP and so everyone including the 
trader is rushing to get the position into the system.  Please let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help.

Per Jeff Gossett,

	Being so that we have a new member to our team, Jeff wants to discuss the Goals and Objectives that you will/have set to accomplish for your individual group this year.  In doing so, he  wants you to think of  the following two things:

	1) How Jeff should measure what  goals/objectives you are planning to accomplish?

	2) What impact do you feel this should have on your review?

		Jeff wants to hear these two things verbally.  Do not include these two anwsers into your Goals and Objectives Presentation!!!

We will keep the same format, as per out last objectives meeting.  Please see the attached documents to print and reveiw; then give me any updates or changes you may have for your objectives.  If you have any questions or need any additional information, please let me know.

 

Thank you,

Irena

Please red the paragragh in red below from an e-mail I sent last month....

I need risk to confirm that all counterparties that have master agreements 
with ECC (now 41 counterparties) need to be booked with 2 legs as described 
below in red.  

We need this confirmation from risk as soon as possible.  We are pushing IT 
to get this logic in place and don't want anything to "blow up" for risk.  
Please respond by e-mail.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

There is a 30 minute meeting every morning on the 28th floor at 8:30 about 
systems issues from the prior night and to discuss what books were not 
officialized.  I have gone to this meeting this week, and I think that we 
should always have a representative in the meeting.  Here is what I propose:  
We alternate weeks going to this meeting.

Week of :
Dec. 4   - Jeff Gossett
Dec. 11 - Darron Giron
Dec. 18 - David Baumbach
Dec. 25 - Will Kelly
Jan. 1    -  Kam Keiser
Jan. 8    - Errol Mclaughlin

And then we will start over again.
If you can not go,  make sure that someone goes in your place.

Thanks

Irena and Elizabeth -  Can you please add these daily meetings to the 
appropriate calender?

Thanks

I am sending the physical trader matrix for another update from risk.  I have

Please update the list with the Sitara Risk Assignment Desk and also review 
the cells I populated to ensure accuracy.

Errol/Kam

For the meetings that I have scheduled with yourselves is it possible to have copies of the DPRs that you produce on a daily basis for the traders?

Also, a deal listing - I believe it is called "Forwards' details" - if this is not possible because the deal volumes are so big an alternative would be appreciated.

For Eastern - I want to look at the Structured deals, amount of deals, types of deals, how they are entered into the system and valued - the hand offs between structuring, risk, settlements and logistics for these non-vanilla deals.  Any deal booking documentation would be an advantage.

For Financial - I want to look at the calendar and basis option portfolios, how these are entered into the systems, captured, fed to risktRAC, spreadsheet models, research sign off etc.

Hope this helps but I will give you an overview at the start of the meetings to ensure you fully understand what the doorstep review is and why we are doing them.

Thanks
Rob

Hey Jeff,

I just wanted to let you know that the fix that the EOL group put into the system
to automatically flip ECC deals to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book is working
great for all deals except Gas Daily -Daily Index deals.  For some reason these
deals aren't being flipped by the system.  This is still causing problems.  I'm not
as familiar with all the Houston books that these types of deals are booked to as
you guys are down there, and I'm missing several when I do my search in TAGG 
before I invoice.  Could you please see if your people can go into their books to 
look for any deals between ECC and third counterparties.  

At least there is a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel, all the rest of the deals
are being flipped okay.  If only we could get these deals looked after, everything
would be perfect.

I'd really appreciate your help on this matter.  Please let me know what you think.

Thanks
Stacey

In the future,  if you have a book that had deals with a third party,  and 
you move those deals out of that book or change that book to another book you 
have to officialize that book after it has nothing in it.  The reason being,  
if someone does not officialize an old book the credit group pulls the last 
available information.  Confusing enough??  Let me know if you need further 
explaination.

Subject: Interest-Rate Hedging Guides - REMINDER

Just a reminder....
Please advise the Rate & Currency Trading Desk when large deals are going to 
be booked by 1:30 P.M. (CST).  This allows the desk to hedge the deal for 
interest rates on the same day that the trade is booked in the commodity 
books.  This eliminates Enron's exposure to markets on the following day for 
these large deals.  

If the Rate & Currency Trading Desk is not notified of large deals prior to 
1:30 P.M., the desk will hedge the interest-rate exposure the next day on a 
best efforts basis.  On these deals, any resulting profit or loss in excess 
of $20,000 will be passed back to the originating group by the trading desk.

We request that the book adminstrator advise Clara Carrington, 3-9224, and 
the Traders should be advising Pushkar Shahi, 3-9199, or Ellen Su, 3-5256, on 
the Rate & Currency Trading Desk.  Europe should contact Shane Dallman, 
3-4997. in the London office. 

Ellen has put together some guidelines which you can share with your traders 
regarding the sizing for large deals.   This is included below.

Your cooperation is appreciated.
Sheila

Guidelines:
The following is a guide to the profit/loss levels in various tenors that 
would require notification of the interest-rate desk.  

Tenor  Notional Cash Flows
2y  30,000,000
3y  20,000,000
5y  15,000,000
10y  10,000,000
15y  7,000,000
20y  5,000,000

Please remember that these amounts are not cumulative.  Each bucket needs to 
be evaluated alone, and then aggregated.  For example, if you had a -30mm 
notional cash flow in the 2-year bucket and it is offset by a +30mm notional 
cash flow in the 20-year bucket, the result would still be very significant 
as the net long cash flow position would still be around +25mm 20-year cash 
flows.

As always, if you are ever unsure, we are more than happy to look at 
deals/curve changes to determine significance.  Thanks.

Ellen Su

>From a legal perspective, the traders are not supposed to have the authority 
to let out another entity from an EnronOnline trade. If the trade is the 
result of a system malfunction or some other uncontrollable issue, the 
customer can get with the trader and agree to reverse out an existing EOL 
transaction with an OTC trade, but Commercial should not be letting customers 
out of EOL deals simply because their traders "clicked on the wrong product". 
This is the policy that Mark Taylor and Legal have had in place since the 
inception of EOL.

I'll get with Sheri and Jennifer and we will see what Legal has to say, but, 
if Mike Maggi and/or John Arnold have been verbally allowing customers to 
change these Gas Daily trades in the past, it definitely creates a problem 
from the perspective of trying to hold them to the same trades now. The best 
advise I can give right now is to make sure that John and Mike do not 
continue allowing customers out of their trades simply because they "clicked 
on the wrong product". The legal responsibility for "clicking on the right 
product" lies firmly with the customer and whenever Commercial starts 
allowing them out of that responsibility it can create serious legal problems 
when and if one of these trades comes back to bite them.

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

Torrey - 

We have an issue where some of our traders are letting traders out of EOL 
deals b/c they "clicked on the wrong product."  What happens is we end up 
having two deals in our systems,  and the counterparty has no deals in their 
system.  So when settlement goes out they tend to accept the one in their 
favor and reject the one against them.  We always work it out but as you can 
imagine it is a huge headache from everyone's perspective.  Please advise on 
what we can do to put an end to this practice.

Thanks

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is

should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

I need risk to confirm that all counterparties that have master agreements

We need this confirmation from risk as soon as possible.  We are pushing IT

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Subject: New Spreadsheet input


Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Subject: Trading Track Information

As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading 
track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their 
respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each 
rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to 
present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or 
someone in your group).  

For example:
What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible 
for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of 
positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the 
floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the 
time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are 
given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato 
and Dave Delaney.

The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:
 where to sit
 User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system, 
intercom, etc.)
 How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.
 Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and 
preferably by 7:30

It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the 
participants on their first day:
 able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and 
answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and 
understand the information that you are giving.
 ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are 
faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick 
decisions and understand which is the most important.
 meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders 
must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.
 Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the 
numbers that you provide to the floor.
 Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and 
expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is 
understandable.
 Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.
 Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of 
the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not 
acceptable.
 Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and 
downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.
 Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the 
job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.
 Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory
 Excellent analytical skills - same
 Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the 
information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts 
what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more 
or better information.
 Effective time management -  self explainatory
 Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important 
that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make 
the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.
 Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions 
and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals 
come from this system.
 Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty 
risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what 
the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.
 Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to 
understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to 
understand proper hedging strategies etc.

Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of 
each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations 
while in your area.

Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing 
in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.

Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in 
your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc)
I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training 
before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of 
understanding of positions and value at risk.

Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into 
some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of 
rotations.

The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.  

Thank you very much for you time and consideration.

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Subject: re: Gas Daily options revaluation

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

It is that time again.  Unfortunitily, we don't have a cooridinator at this time.

After talking to Brian Heinrick, the major driver is head count.

I am meeting with Brian, to go over what the time line looks like (very short I am sure).

PLease look at your head count numbers for the 2001 budget, head count today and what you think you need for 2002.

I will try to make this as painless as possilbe.

thanks

bob

Subject: Hedges not linking to sitara deals

Dat and George, risk informed me of 2 additional sitara deals that are not 
"linking" the hedges to the primary sitara deal.  Dat, can you please look 
into this and let me know if this is a quick fix or not.  Risk is inquiring.  
EOL #719279 and #713548 are the one's on question.

Tara and Torrey, what is happening is risk is not seeing a hedge attaching to 
the sitara deal and manually booking the hedge.  But, the hedge is being 
created, just not linked to the primary physical deal.  

Jeff,  I will let you know when this is corrected.  Please advise your group 
not to manually hedge the deals in sitara.  If in doubt if it is hedged, have 
them type in the next number after the sitara number which should be the 
hedge.  For example, the physical deal is 547092, the hedge will be 547093.  
Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn
