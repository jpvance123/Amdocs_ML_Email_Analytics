Jane,

I know your schedule is very busy, as is mine. This means we don't get to 
talk much and catch up. I just want you to know that we really appreciate 
your help on the many fronts you are fighting, including MSEB/MERC, Metgas, 
LNG shipping policy, Electricity Act 2000, Derivatives trading, etc. It is a 
great comfort to know that we have someone dedicated to this function who 
brings so much personal history and knowledge as well as access to the larger 
Enron regulatory family.

I get very positive feedback from all who interact with you, both internally 
and externally. Keep up the good work.

Wade

Team:  The Blockbuster deal has meant so much to everyone at EBS.  It seems 
like half of the company (but then I exaggerate!) has been working 
relentlessly on the deal for the past three months.  So it meant a lot to 
everyone here that we were able to make such a big deal out of it with the 
announcement and employee event.

You wouldn't believe the phonecalls we received from potential customers, 
partners and others due to the publicity.  And employees were stunned by the 
fabulous production in the lobby.

My most sincere thanks and congratulations for a fantastic job.  We really 
appreciate all of your hard work and creativity on this.  Thank you!!!

Just wanted you to know what a great team effort we had for the Blockbuster 
announcement...

Mike Rosen coordinated the lobby set-up, including the marquee lights around 
the video wall, red carpeting, placement of the Star Wars figures, and also 
arranged for the popcorn machines on the EBS floors.  In addition, Mike 
worked through the night with Pam White, Chris Glenn, Gary Cowan and Stevan 
Smith of Bowne (none of them went home) to coordinate the receipt of the 
video from New York and to transpose and encode it into the right  format for 
the video wall and the elevator monitors.  They then arranged to have the 
video delivered to the EBS team in Portland.

Cindy Derecskey came in at 3:30 a.m. to issue the press release and place it 
on the home page.

Without any advance notice, Iona Maclean issued the press release to the 
European wires less than 10 minutes after my request.

Laura Schwartz took the initiative to draft a media advisory that she sent to 
local media early Wednesday morning.  She then made follow-up calls to each 
station, which resulted in coverage on channel 13, channel 11, channel 26, 
channel 45, KUHF, KTRH, KIKK, KILT and KUHF.

Brandon Rigney and Rodney Reagor highlighted the Blockbuster deal on the home 
page (Newsroom "In the Spotlight") and on the intranet ("New and Notable").

Congratulations on an incredible Blockbuster announcement!

SK - I've printed this out and added to the file.  mm
"In connection with mid-year VP PRC, I would like each of you to prepare a 
list of accomplishments, 2000 goals achieved, etc."

Steve,

Per your July 7th request:

Performance Based Rates Analysis and Training for SK-Enron.  The ultimate 
commercial objective is to establish a rate making framework for Korean gas 
distribution companies that will allow theJV's operating companies to retain 
profits derived from efficiency gains and earned returns that exceed the 
statuatory rate of return.  Analysis of several PBR mechanisms demonstrated 
the potential benefits from replacing the current Cost of Service framework 
with an incentive based system.  An eductional workshop based on the results 
of this analysis was organized and presented to Executive, Financial and 
Regulatory staffs of the JV and its 9 City Gas Companies.
Improved Cost of Service Rate Filing Procedures and Methods. The commercial 
objective is to improve the results achieved by SK-Enron's City Gas Companies 
when preparing and negotiating new rates under the current COS framework 
employed in Korea.  Several areas within the current framework where 
"forward-looking" cost calculation methods could be employed to better match 
costs that will be incurred while new rates are in effect and the revenues 
earned were identified.  The need and benefit of determining the cost of 
service for each class of customer was also demonstrated.  Results of the 
analysis and methodology for determining COS by customer class was presented 
to the Executive, Financial and Regulatory staffs of the JV and its 9 CGCs.  
Elimination of 10% Dividend Restriction imposed on the City Gas Companies of 
SK-Enron.  The commercial objective is to more effectively employ cash 
generated within the JV's CGCs by freeing these companies from a Ministry of 
Commerce, Industry, and Energy "guideline" limiting dividends to 10% of each 
company's par stock value.  The initial approach was to develop a program 
that would consolidate all of the JV's CGCs into the Joint Venture company 
and thereby eliminate the need for dividends that would give the holding 
company access to opertating cash flows.  The regulatory implications of such 
an effort were analyzed and provided to the project team.  Opinion sampling 
of local regulators indicated strong opposition to such a strategy.  This 
insight plus tax issues of Enron's partner, led to the conclusion that 
implementation of this strategy would be difficult.  A direct lobbying 
program to convince MOCIE to lift this guideline is currently being developed.
Feasibility of EnronOnLine launch in Korea.  The commercial objective is to 
create the opportunity for Korean companies to become customers of Enron's 
worldwide trading network.  Initial due diligence has established the 
feasibility of offering commodity products such as crude oil, refined 
products, and LPG and has identified issues the must be addressed with the 
Korean government to effectively deal in financial and weather derivatives.
Required Korean consents and other regulatory matters for Project Summer.  
The commercial objective is to enhance Enron shareholder value.  Regulatory 
consents possibly required were identified and contractual issues with 
Enron's partner have been highlighted.
Gas transmission company ratemaking workshop for Korean Gas Company (KOGAS) 
and Korean Energy Economics Institute (KEEI).  The commercial objective is to 
have Korea adopt an open access gas tranmission rate framework that is 
supportive of LNG marketing by Enron in Korea and improving gas supply cost 
of the JV's CGCs.  A workshop for representatives of KOGAS and KEEI was 
organized in Houston and introductions were made to the FERC staff in 
Washington DC.  The KEEI work product from its rate study effort has not been 
made available as of this date because of internal issues within KOGAS.
Keynote speaking role for APACHE CEO at Asia Pacific Economic Council Energy 
Ministers Meeting.  The commercial objective of this effort was to improve 
Enron APACHE's ability to shape policies relating to its business by raising 
the profile of its CEO amoung senior energy officials from throughout Asia.  
Rebecca McDonald was one of three Key Note speakers for the opening of the 
conference.  She was accorded this honor even though Enron contributed a 
fraction of the financial support for the conference that several other 
energy companies did.  Her remarks on e:commerce and energy received 
considerable positive attention from many attendees including the Korean 
delegation.  
Meeting with US Embassador to Korea.  The commercial objective was to improve 
Enron's chances of winning bids for energy assets, particularly electric 
generation facilities scheduled to be privatized by the government.  A 
meeting was organized for myself, SK-Enron's Chief Operating officer, and the 
JV's General Manager of Operations.  Based on the experience in bidding late 
in 1999, the Embassador was urged to advocate for more transparent and less 
subjective bid evaluation procedures that substantially increased the 
likelihood of closure on asset sales.  Ultimately, sucessful privatization 
will create both asset acquisition and commodity marketing opportunities.

Steve - as you will see from below, Mac's weekly report contained below lists 
all that he is working on or leading.  Consistent with Terry's point at the 
PRC, has has duties that go way beyond government and regulatory affairs 
(indeed, when you read through it, I am not sure how he even has time for all 
of it).  This is not a complaint, just verification of Terry's point, but 
does also suggest that we should think about if his PRC/review is 
appropriately within our group or not (what about the group you did the day 
before, property services, for example, given his seemingly do-it-all "office 
manager" role?).  mcs

Here's my effort to respond to the PRC discussion we had in Kohler.  

The criteria for evaluating folks is at the end of the presentation ... but I 
took the liberty to go a bit further and comprehensively address the PRC 
process.    Hope I didn't overstep my bounds ....

I'm around today, as well as Monday (ENA meeting most of the day) and 
Tuesday, but then traveling in Reno, Las Vegas and San Francisco for the 
remainder of the week.   I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the reasoning 
and rationale behind the document.  

As I said on my voice mail, I circulated the document to the attendees at 
Kohler (with the exception of Sue L. and Linda R.).  I've had feedback from a 
number of the attendees, but I can't call it a consensus document.

As always, thanks for the opportunity to make suggestions like this.

Bert - 

Thank you for the kind words and taking time to communicate your thoughts.

I certainly have a great appreciation of the teams abilities, given the 
relentless and sometimes extreme demands that come our way.  Recognition is 
not expected, just the nature of our work, but it sure is nice when it 
comes.  Thanks again.

- Bill

Subject: Thank You - June 16th Move

Bill, this is a note of appreciation for allowing me to work with Deborah 
Bubenko and the designers from Gensler, Ross Davis and Vince Flickinger.  
Together, they made the floor design for EIP and the entire move from 1400 
Smith to 3AC as easy as any move could be.  From beginning to end, they 
worked with me to address our needs and were creative in the design.  Deborah 
always returned my calls timely or directed me to the correct person.   She 
is knowledgeable and has good public relations skills.

Ross is an excellent designer.  Along with Vince, he created space where 
there was none and utilized every space available.  The floor plan was 
brainstormed, designed and finalized in only three or four official meetings 
with Ross.  Yet when the space was completed, all the details discussed were 
there.  The space has a "first class" appearance as well as a very efficient 
work environment.  It was certainly a pleasure to work with Ross and Vince.  
They responded timely, kept me up-to-date and followed through on details 
throughout every step of the construction.

The plan to include in the churn process, designated support who help wrap 
and pack artwork, fragiles etc. proved to be cost efficient for our move.  
This eliminated damage to furniture that required refinishing, touch up or 
replacement.  There was less down-time of the assistants because of their 
expertise.  They knew what to do, how to do it and they just came in and did 
it.   Follow up after the move by Christina Yepez was very customer oriented 
and timely.  She seemed always to be here at the right moment to make sure 
everything was working.  She efficiently contacted the correct people to get 
all loose items completed, voluntarily advised me of the status and was 
extremely willing to do whatever was needed.

A special thank you to all the movers.  Especially Jose, Luis, Abel, Gerardo, 
Antonio, Alonso and Manuel who did not get to their share of donuts!  Thank 
you for my best "churn" experience during my six+ years at Enron.

The Washington Global Finance office is chartered with the responsibility to 
support Enron's activities with the Washington-based financing institutions - 
OPIC, EXIM, and the multilateral institutions - the World Bank and IFC and 
the InterAmerican Development Bank.  Every project financing done by the 
company in the emerging markets over the past several years has involved 
these agencies and this year is no exception.

 In the past six months we have supported five projects before these 
institutions:
  Cuiaba - Disbursement is now projected for mid-August.  OPIC is pleased 
with the progress.  We have had to tweak the process to keep the project 
moving forward; that process has been successful.  We have also been heavily 
involved in the environmental aspects of the project, working with the 
project team on the Environmental Health and Safety program, the 
international NGOs and the Conservation Program to keep these aspects on 
track.   
  Gaza -  We have been heavily involved throughout the first half of the year 
getting OPIC to a Board vote which was successful in March.  We used the 
Department of State and other agencies to pressure OPIC politically to do the 
deal.  Since the board vote the developers have been focussed on the 
financing with Arab Bank but we are now in a process of pushing State to get 
OPIC to move forward to financial close on reasonable financial lterms and 
conditions.
  Guatemala barge mounted plant at Puerto Quertzal - OPIC and MARAD are to 
provide financing. We have been working with the finance team to keep the 
project moving forward and are now looking at fijnancial close by the end of 
the summer. 
  Argentina water for the Province of Buenos Aires -   This office is pushing 
both the financing parties, OPIC and IDB, and Azurix to an end of September 
Board approval on a financing that started late spring.  the time frame is 
extremely short but unless we keep on schedule we will lose close to six 
months.  We are driving the schjedule and then overseeing all parties to keep 
the financing on track, so far successfully.   
  RioGen -  We have been working with the Rio team to ensure that 
consultation on the environmental assessment is conducted properly to avoid 
Cuiaba type problems and help the IDB financing.  We are getting the 
requirements with the team sorted out so that the process will go forward in 
an appropriate manner.

 In the past six months we have supported the development efforts of the 
following projects:
  Nigeria - We were heavily involved in getting the World Bank to back away 
from their opposition to our project, as well as getting the State 
Department, DOE and Treasury to aggressively support our efforts to conclude 
a deal in Lagos.  We finally persuaded the Bank to take the position that it 
was not fully current on the status of the project and so could not comment.  
The USG supported our efforts and did help the process by which Enron was 
finally able to conclude a deal.
  Camisea - We were heavily involved in sorting out the environmental 
requirements for this project in Peru to go forward.  We spent considerable 
time educating the developer team on these requirements.  We met on several 
with the Peruvian Minister of Energy and had  him meet with OPIC, IDB and the 
World Bank to better understand the impact of environmental issues on 
financing.
  Bulacan Biomass project, Philippines - We are working with the project team 
to obtain political risk insurance for the project through OPIC or MIGA.
  LNG project, Venezuela:  We are working with the finance team exploring 
OPIC, IFC, IDB financing for this project.
  Pipavov power project, India - Working with the project team regarding 
OPIC, IFC financing for the project
  Subsea fiber laying project, Caribbean:  We have undertaken discussions 
with financing and other institutions re sub-sea fiber laying jproject, 
including addressing licensing requirements of the FCC for international 
telecom projects.
  SIEPAC - We have had meetings with the project team on the status of this 
Central American electricity transmission project and how we might get 
involved.
  Puerto Suarez - We have been working with the project team to address 
environmental issues relating to the transmission line that is in the 
Pantanel in preparation for OPIC or IDB financing.
  Cuiaba II - We have been working with the team to develop a strategy to 
address the siting of compression stations so that the environmentalists will 
not create major problems.  This is a problem for both Phase I and II.
  EES Projects in Southern Cone and Eastern Europe - We have met with the 
IDB, IFC and OPIC and have arrived at an agreed upon financing strucure which 
now awaits EES projects in these regions.


 In the past six months we have also been involved in supporting our existing 
asset base on a variety of issues before these institutions as well as to 
agencies of the USG:
  Dominican Republic - Have been working with the DR team to broaden pressure 
on the government regarding our payment problems, including the IFC and World 
Bank, the IDB and the USG, especially State, Treasury and DOE.
  Trakya, Turkey -   We have been working with the asset team to mobilize USG 
support through OPIC, EXIM, state and Treasury to address payment problems.  
the USG is now aggressively supporting Enron in our effort to get these 
issues under control.  We are also in discussion with OPIC and EXIM about the 
prospective selldown of our equity interest in Trakya, as we are for Cuiaba 
and Dabhol. 


 In the past six months we have also been involved in a range of other issues 
of importance to the company:
  Transfer issues:  I have developed a strategy as to how to approach OPIC, 
EXIM, MIGA and the other financing institutions in the event there is a 
transfer situation. We are now awaiting whether it will be needed.
  OPIC in Mexico:  As part of our overarching relationship with OPIC we have 
agreed to spearhead an initiastive to assist OIPIC develop a program in 
Mexico.  that effort has been very well received by OPIC and George Munoz and 
is ongoing.
  EXIM Relationship:  As part of our effort to establish a relationship with 
EXIM and Chairman Jim Harmon we agreed to spearhead the analysis of the 
market windows issue.  the effort has been very well received; Joe Sutton is 
now on the EXIM Advisory Board and Enron will be on the commission 
considering EXIM's future.  Harmon and EXIM have been very complimentary of 
Enron's initiative in this regard. 
  Environmental Issues:  I am working with Kelly Kimberly and her team, and 
with the Southern Cone to better address our environmental needs in that 
region and throughout the emerging markets.
