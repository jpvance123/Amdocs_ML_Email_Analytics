Miguel,
Given where things are, I think it is imperative that we begin to think of a "contingency" plan for Procaribe.  I want us to do several analysis that will allow us to better understand what are the financial results of a variety of potential commercial decisions/strategies.  So, here is what I would like to see done asap:

-	A revised 2002-2004 analysis (both earnings and cash) that assumes NO PDVSA transaction and that volumes for us remain what they have been all along (i.e., assumes that Progasco's volumes stay in at the old margins).
-	A revised 2002-2004 analysis (both earnings and cash) that assumes NO PDVSA  transaction and that the volumes of Progasco remain BUT ONLY at MB plus 9.5 margin.
-	A revised 2002-2004 analysis (both earnings and cash) that assumes NO PDVSA transaction and NO Progasco volumes.  
-	I assume we are pretty comfortable with the other volumes; i.e., in our ability to keep them so I'm not asking for a sensitivity on those.

Please advise when this analysis can be ready and when we can begin to discuss potential commercial alternatives to the PDVSA transaction/giving in to Humberto's demand of MB plus 9.5.

Thanks, Mariella

The meeting with Mr. Ram?n Gonz?lez, president of Empire Gas Company went as follows:

?	A written offer of $0.04 cpg for the throughput and the terminals value added strengths was handed to Mr. Gonz?lez.  It also mentioned that such agreement was to be supported with a contract covering all the legal aspects of such throughput.  Mr. Gonz?lez mentioned that the $0.04 cpg was an offer somewhat high but he was going to consider it along with PDVSA's next year price offer.  He thinks that PDVSA's FOB price should be MB flat and that Enron should have the capability of getting a better price for a vessel so that the landed price is somewhat cheaper than that of using PDVA's vessels.  He also said that effective November 1, 2001 all of Puerto Rico volume except for San Juan Gas will belong to him. (Mr. Humberto Berrios Tropigas / Progas) assures us that he has not  close any deals with Empire and that he is waiting for an offer from ProCaribe for November / December and hopes that we can offer him a MB + 9.50 and is also waiting for our year 2002 offer.  

?	Mr. Gonz?lez considers PDVSA's next year prices as too high and that another alternative should be looked to see if prices are better (this is a tactic he uses to show PDVSA the new price so that PDVSA lowers their price to him).  He said that he does not trust the Phoenix Park Group (Trinidad & Tobago) at all.  Plus he knows that all of their volume is committed to their customers.  He is concerned with the way the Venezuela Government has been behaving lately and he thinks President Chavez is a communists.  He is concerned with future business deals that a sudden change in Government (towards the left) might bring.  He also said that PDVSA still is his best option as it has been for the last fifteen years.

?	He asked us if ProCaribe was for sale and that he will like to be considered as a future buyer.  He asked us to please inform of his petition.

The meeting went very well and cordial.  We consider it as a good starting point.  We think that the next step to follow is for William Mauc? to push PDVSA to pursue this deal.  Our next meeting with Mr. Gonz?lez should include the group so he can see Enron commitment to this throughput proposal.

Manuel y Mariela, en el anexo encontrar?n un an?lisis comparativo
   de los costos de transporte y recepci?n de las entregas de GLP a 
   su cliente Empire Gas de P. Rico  actuales vs las que se tendr?an
   utilizando el terminal de ProCaribe.
   Estas cifras son el resultado de un "Due Dilligence" realizado en la
   Isla  y completado con informaciones de Ship Brokers que trabajan 
   con Pdvsa.  Como podr?n observar el resultado arroja oportunidades
   significativas de Creacion de Valor que pudieran ser compartidas
   entre Pdvsa y Enron y brindarle a la vez a su cliente incentivos econ?micos
   y log?sticos .  Adicionalmente, se tendr?an oportunidades de incrementar la
   relaci?n comercial de Pdvsa con Enron dado que las econom?as se ver?an
   potenciadas al efectuar cargos combinados con las entregas a Empire Gas.          

  Como acordamos en telcon Carballo /Mauc? les suministro toda la informaci?n
  para su revisi?n , la cual la comparar?amos con la de Uds. para su conciliaci?n 
  antes de discutir como podr?amos implementar los cambios y distribuir los
  incentivos generados.   

 Saludos y hablamos para discutir en detalle las econom?as y propuesta de 
 implantaci?n .

 William Andr?s Mauc?

Coralina,

The above referenced document between The Puerto Rico Ports Authority and The Protane Corporation is due to expire December 31, 2002 (Section 4.01). ProCaribe and the owner of EcoElectrica will make a decision next year about whether or not to extend.

Note that the LPG Storage and Services Agreement between ProCaribe and Eco states in Section 23.2.1(c) that ProCaribe will exercise all renewal or extension options under the Tallaboa Pier Agreement for the life of the LPG Storage and Services Agreement. Eco may, however, request or consent to the termination of the Tallaboa Pier Agreement as outlined in Section 23.2.1(b). 

The Tallaboa Pier Agreement calls for ProCaribe and/or EcoElectrica to pay an annual fee of $200,000 plus escalation (Section 5.01). In return, ProCaribe and Eco receive First Preferential Use of the pier (Section 3.01 and 5.01) and do not pay dockage or wharfage (Section 5.01).

When the Eco deal was first put together, it was probably considered to be important that Eco have the First Preferential Use of the pier during Phase I of the project. It was expected that an LPG ship was going to be docked at Tallaboa Pier a large percentage of the time. As it turned out, there were no conflicts with other vessels as we are the only ones that have used the pier for the past few years. The pier could get other traffic in the future but that only matters if Eco is burning LPG. 

It would be interesting to know if the Credit Agreement requires Eco to maintain its First Preferential Use rights for the life of the PPOA. Since LPG is Eco's back-up fuel, there is a possibility that the banks are requiring it.  

Let me know if you need me to take this any further.


Paul

Mariella,

Below is the pricing for ProCaribe's LPG purchase. There are four price tranches. The two fixed price tranches of 2600MT and 1768 MT represent volumes sold and yet-to-be-sold during the time frame April 16th to May 31st. Note that ProCaribe's revenue stream for the portion of LPG sold during the second half of April (~1400 MT) was based on Mont Belvieu of $0.543/gallon. Month-to-date Mont Belvieu for May is $0.5145/gallon. ProCaribe's revenue for volumes sold in May (~2900 MT) will be based on the average Mont Belvieu price for the entire month.

Pricing of this cargo has worked out such that ProCaribe will make approximately 1-cent per gallon more margin than it would had they purchased LPG at a 7-cent per gallon premium to average Mont Belvieu for the month in which the sales occurred.

Paul

Paul,
I don't know if you have made your decision yet but I'm worried about Procaribe's commercial strategy beyond October or the expiration of the Progasco interim agreement.  I believe we asked (if not I will) Miguel to put together a revised 2002 plan assuming the PDVSA transaction does NOT close.  I want him thinking about what he will do (and how) to minimize Procaribe's commercial losses.  Is he ready to give into Humberto's demands at 9.5 over MB?, etc., those issues will surface in a properly conducted analysis.  I know he will need your help.  May I impose on you to help him out?

Thanks, Mariella

Mariella,

We need to be looking to buy a  September or October cargo with pricing that would allow us to extend the sales deal to Humberto for the Progasco volumes. Suzanne Clapp called me this morning about a possible Algerian cargo for late September (10,000 metric tons). I told her that we could be interested in a Fixed Price of $246-247 per metric ton delivered to ProCaribe. With hedging, Suzanne would convert that to a price of Mont Belvieu plus $0.053 per gallon. She is going to call and see if they are interested at that price.

If we are able to get this cargo at this pricing, we could extend our deal with Humberto to 1/31/02 and make $0.042 per gallon. With borrowing from Eco, we could add another two months to Humberto's deal and have it end 3/31/02. As of today, I expect that the margin on those next two months would be $0.025-0.030 per gallon. It could get better if the forward curve would cooperate.

I will be happy to help out as long as I can. Let's talk when you have a chance.

Thanks, Paul

Paul,
I don't know if you have made your decision yet but I'm worried about Procaribe's commercial strategy beyond October or the expiration of the Progasco interim agreement.  I believe we asked (if not I will) Miguel to put together a revised 2002 plan assuming the PDVSA transaction does NOT close.  I want him thinking about what he will do (and how) to minimize Procaribe's commercial losses.  Is he ready to give into Humberto's demands at 9.5 over MB?, etc., those issues will surface in a properly conducted analysis.  I know he will need your help.  May I impose on you to help him out?

Thanks, Mariella

Subject:	Ram?n Gonz?lez Throughput Meeting

The meeting with Mr. Ram?n Gonz?lez, president of Empire Gas Company went as follows:

?	A written offer of $0.04 cpg for the throughput and the terminals value added strengths was handed to Mr. Gonz?lez.  It also mentioned that such agreement was to be supported with a contract covering all the legal aspects of such throughput.  Mr. Gonz?lez mentioned that the $0.04 cpg was an offer somewhat high but he was going to consider it along with PDVSA's next year price offer.  He thinks that PDVSA's FOB price should be MB flat and that Enron should have the capability of getting a better price for a vessel so that the landed price is somewhat cheaper than that of using PDVA's vessels.  He also said that effective November 1, 2001 all of Puerto Rico volume except for San Juan Gas will belong to him. (Mr. Humberto Berrios Tropigas / Progas) assures us that he has not  close any deals with Empire and that he is waiting for an offer from ProCaribe for November / December and hopes that we can offer him a MB + 9.50 and is also waiting for our year 2002 offer.  

?	Mr. Gonz?lez considers PDVSA's next year prices as too high and that another alternative should be looked to see if prices are better (this is a tactic he uses to show PDVSA the new price so that PDVSA lowers their price to him).  He said that he does not trust the Phoenix Park Group (Trinidad & Tobago) at all.  Plus he knows that all of their volume is committed to their customers.  He is concerned with the way the Venezuela Government has been behaving lately and he thinks President Chavez is a communists.  He is concerned with future business deals that a sudden change in Government (towards the left) might bring.  He also said that PDVSA still is his best option as it has been for the last fifteen years.

?	He asked us if ProCaribe was for sale and that he will like to be considered as a future buyer.  He asked us to please inform of his petition.

The meeting went very well and cordial.  We consider it as a good starting point.  We think that the next step to follow is for William Mauc? to push PDVSA to pursue this deal.  Our next meeting with Mr. Gonz?lez should include the group so he can see Enron commitment to this throughput proposal.

Saludos

Miguel,
What were the agreed upon next steps (if any)?   As to his understanding of Procaribe's status, we do not currently have a sales process ongonig so I'm not sure where he got that.  I wonder if he is simply searching for information ... and, what concerns me is that he could use that against us in the PDVSA dealings.  We should be very careful with him; don't you think?
THanks

On Friday, May 18th, 2001 Mr. Johnny Fern?ndez, Esq. Executive Director of Codezol (Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce) invited us to a meeting.  Also present was Mr. Edmundo Rodr?guez, President and CEO of Nestor Reyes, Inc. which is the biggest customs broker in Puerto Rico and are also very much involved in developing sub zones for the foreign trade zones.  Mr. Fern?ndez highly recommends the use of the office of Nestor Reyes, Inc. because of their experience in these matters.  

The following law offices have contacted us:
	* Miller & Company P.C. 
	Attorneys at Law
	Marshall V. Miller
	1825 1 Street N.W, Suite 400
	Washington, DC  20006
	Phone (202) 429-2017 Fax (202) 659-6848
	e-mail: mmiller@millerco.com

According to Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez, Mr. Miller is the most experience lawyer in the field of foreign trade zones with 31 years of experience.  He has many customers in Puerto Rico,  knows Puerto Rico, and is a frequent traveller to the Island.  He will send a brochure about his company.

	* Phelan & Mitri
	I Atlantic Street
	Standford, CT  06901
	Phone (203) 967-4140 Fax (203) 325-3056
	Mike Mitri, Esq.
	Bill Phelan, Esq.

These were the lawyers that helped Peerless get their sub zone.   According to Mr. Mitri they will charge ProCaribe between $60,000 to $65,000 for their services.  They will send us information regarding their office.

Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez recommends two sub zones one for ProCaribe and another for EcoEl?ctrica instead of one mainly because the different type of businesses.  We need a "story" that should be strong enough to convince the U.S. Customs in approving the sub zones.  When I mention ProCaribe's re-export capabilities, they both understand that we have a good "story".  They recommend Marshall Miller, Esq. to help us with our "story".  EcoEl?ctrica needs to put together a "story", and someone from their group should start to get involve in the fact finding like I am doing for ProCaribe.

The following is Nestor Reyes, Inc. address:

	* Nestor Reyes, Inc.
	U.S. Customs Brokers
	Edmundo Rodr?guez, President and CEO
	PO Box 9023474
	San Juan, PR  00902-6468
	e-mail: e.rodriguez@nreyes.com
	Phone (787) 289-6465 Fax (787) 289-6468

Please let me know your comments and instructions to continue working with the sub zone matter.

Saludos

Gentlemen,

It seems to me that the price should be MB plus $0.12 for every month. The last cargo purchase saw a value gain for ProCaribe through optimization of the pricing structure by using price swaps. The prices below transfer that value gain away from ProCaribe. I cannot tell if the value is being transferred to the Progasco sale or to Tropigas. Comments???

In order to provide Humberto the short term supply we have been talking about for a while, and to secure a 5-cent margin for Procaribe as agreed to with Mariella, we will sell him the product with the following terms:

Term:	4 months @ 1MM gal/mo.
Start Date:  On closing of Progasco sale (June)

Pricing: (depending on month of delivery)
	June		MB + 11.25
	July		MB + 11.00
	August		MB + 12.00
	September	MB + 12.00
	October		MB + 12.00

Miguel has a model contract approved by Coralina with the rest of the standard terms.  I suggest we send it to Humberto so he is ready to go by closing.

To clarify the 15-day supply with Progas:  this is inventory that, for the most part, is already at Progas.  If there was any shortage, most likely it would be discounted from the purchase price, so no additional product would need to be delivered.

Paul

Progas pays for the 15 days.  
I assume that premium 1 means a penny and premium 2 means 2 pennies.  Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?

Miguel

How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.  Where are you on your investigation of making Procaribe and Eco free trade zones.  This should help you with your cash flow and transhipments since you do not pay taxes until you pay the taxes until you sell the product in PR.  Do you know how long it takes to do this?

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

Subject:	Re: Next Cargo   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Subject:	Next Cargo

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

Elio,

Looking at the 11,800 MT case of Puerto Rico versus the Mediterranean:

The numbers below indicate a $20/MT difference in freight versus the $7.50/MT difference that I mentioned earlier.

If Med. prices are $215/MT and Mont Belvieu is $0.39/gal., then a Puerto Rico delivery would look like either of the following two cases:

1.	($215 + $20)/521 = $0.451 per gallon or MB plus 6.1 cents ,i.e., 0.9 cents/gallon savings vs PDVSA

or 

2.	($215 + $7.5)/521 = $0.427 per gallon or MB plus 3.7 cents ,i.e., 3.3 cents/gallon savings vs PDVSA

There would be additional savings of 0.25 cents to 0.50 cents per gallon for both of the cases above if a West Africa supplier would do a fixed price deal and thus we would avoid going through Lee's Bid-Ask spread.  

Tomorrow we should refresh the Med. price and the MB price and get Bo to get a more exact freight differential. Then we can recalculate the numbers and see if this is worth pursuing.

Subject:	Freight Rates - West Africa - Med / Caribs

Paul, in comparing freight rates for Med vs Caribs and Caribs vs Caribs (cargo size), I do see Bo's point.  

For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.:
	$50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and 
 	$60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs

however,

the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows:
	$30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and
	$40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs

So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to 
Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00.

Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better.

Let me know your thoughts.

Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.  I would hesitate to purchase from an alternative source lest they back off on other negotiations.

Best regards,
Suzanne

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

William,

Attached is a revised PDVSA freight cost comparison for delivery to Empire versus delivery to ProCaribe. The analysis incorporates the data provided by Miguel Maltes that is shown below. This new analysis indicates that port costs are lower than previously assumed but vessel costs are higher. The net impact is virtually NO CHANGE. Please call me if you have any questions.

Subject:	Port Costs

Paul,

The information that follows was provided by Luis Ayala Col?n Sucrs., Inc, the PDVSA shipping agency in Puerto Rico.  These are actual port costs using the LPG/C Nelly Maersk which is the vessel servicing Empire Gas Company this year.  

The following are the port costs estimates (quite close):

	1.  Barrels discharge per trip at CORCO - 30,000 bbls., Tropigas - 24,000 bbls., Liquilux - 20,000 bbls.,  One trip is three 	     ports and another trip is two ports per month.

	2.  Discharge rates were given to us on an hourly basis and the agents took the average time per docking:  CORCO -                          	    48 hours or 625 bbls/hr., Tropigas - 28 hours or 857 bbls/hr., Liquilux - 20 hours or 1,000 bbls/hr., 

	3.  Port costs at: 

		Tallaboa $18,000
		CORCO $18,000
		Tropigas $13,000
		Liquilux $17,000

	    Liquilux port costs are per the Port of Ponce tariffs which are different from the Puerto Rico Ports Authority tariffs 
                    which apply to Tallaboa, Guayanilla and San Juan.  At San Juan (Tropigas) the tug boats cost less due to the fact 
                    that all tug boats companies are docked within the San Juan bay.

	4.  Port costs are not included in the vessel costs.  

	5.  Port costs includes dockage, wharfage, harbor pilots, tug boats, and harbor fees.  ProCaribe charges the 
                     dockage and warfage to the shipping agent.  All these costs are charged by the shipping agent to the owner of the  	     vessel, the owner of the vessel then charges the charter party.

	6.  Other costs:  Crudita - $4/barrel., Customs - $610.00 (Custom entry service $125, Custom duty deposit $485)., 
                     Laboratories - $135/test (3 - 5 per ship)., Inspectors - $0.1780 per long ton., Loss Control Agent - $0.35 per MT., 

	7.  Days steaming from Jose Venezuela to Puerto Rico and in between island ports:  

	              Jose to Puerto Rico (Ponce, Guayanilla and Tallaboa) - 36 hours
	              San Juan to Jose - 46 hours
	              CORCO to Ponce - 2 hours
	              Ponce to San Juan - 14 hours
       	              CORCO to San Juan - 14 hours

	     These timings are from dock to dock.

	8.  ProCaribe annual expenses:

	            Year				2000		2001 (1CE)
	            Payroll				$554M		$525M
	            O + M				$1,447M	$1,534M	
	            Depreciation			$475M		$492M
    	           Taxes other than income		$211M		$250M
        	           Other expenses			$160M		$86M

I hope this figures can help you in your model.  If you have any questions please call me.

Subject:	Procaribe's next cargo

Miguel,

As we analyze what and how to deal with your next cargo requirements, we need the following information:

-	Current levels of inventory at Procaribe, broken down between your own and Eco's product - projected as of end of September (please provide basis; i.e., levels of as of the actual date that you provide data plus your projections through end of the month on withdrawals/uses)
-	Projected sales volumes for the months of  October, November, December and January of next year, including (and this is very critical!) the basis for your projections.  I am going to be interested in looking at your assumptions for both Progasco (now Tropigas) and Empire volumes, if any.
-	Please ensure that your San Juan Gas volumes have been signed off by Federico.

We need this data as soon as you can so that we can begin to look at cargo options and/or evaluate the decision to borrow from Eco.

Thanks and Regards, Mariella

Paul,

Believe it or not (yes, call me crazy!), I went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were so kind to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions, which I would like for you to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process.  

-	First, given the added uncertainty of Procaribe's volumes (sales) now that Progasco is owned by someone else, unless Miguel can guarantee (through some form of written agreement) that he will have Progasco's volumes, I think we should be more open to or more inclined to borrow Eco's volumes (clearly, we wouldn't do so if the curve looks awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization).
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Without the Progasco volume, it will take much longer to sell-off this cargo. The hedging would be different. If Humberto unexpectedly showed up to buy, the timing of our hedge would be off. I think we should sign-up Humberto for Nov-Dec at whatever we can get. Come January it will be a new ballgame as Empire will need to get a new contract with PDVSA. We could probably up our price at that time.

-	Second, it seems to me that you wouldn't me too inclined to try to fix the cost of your product bought from, say, PDVSA, unless you are very concerned about an increasing curve (right around the 3 days surrounding the bill of lading) that will not necessarily stay long enough to keep your "sales" curve up to guarantee a margin.  In fact, you would likely wait and continue to watch the curve and either not act at all or act shortly before the bill of lading dates.  Now, in your May hedging example, if you actually compare the hedged vs. non-hedged results, it tells you that you were better off with a no hedge on the earlier months (month for which data on the revenue side was known and most of the curve deciding your price to PDVSA was also known).  Then, my question is: why did we decide to hedge that volume when the hedge was put in place on 5/9, only a week or so before the actual bill of lading date? Do you remember what was concerning us?
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
You would hedge the purchase cost if you were going to be repaying borrowings and you liked the price you could lock-in. Also, as you say, if you were concerned that prices during your sales period would not hold their value relative to the 3-days around B/L. Yes, we missed $0.003/gallon by hedging the part of the cargo that was sold in April and early May. We were not particularly concerned about anything. Just wanted to be rid of the possibility that prices could have gone up a penny or two.

-	Third, it seems to me that, on the May hedge, (the second part of the volume) someone lost big time - I could be wrong, but what I'm looking at is the fix we got (Suzanne got) in return for the floating; the fix rate was much higher than the actual MBv figures for the months of June and July (this assumes of course the Enron didn't turn around and laid off that risk on someone else).  What I am trying to say is that, there appears to have been something going on with the curve on or around 5/21 that changed dramatically once actual figures were recorded.  Do you remember?  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
LPG prices dropped dramatically in June going below $0.35 per gallon. Normally, no one in Enron would get hurt because Lee Jackson would have hedged himself with someone outside of the company. However, he actually left his position open and lost about $300k. That does not impact us.

-	Fourth, it seems to me that your swaps were being built around a primary objective (beyond risk protection): to deliver approximately 5 cents per gallon margin to Miguel.  Anytime we have that opportunity, we should grab it.  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Yes, I want to lock the margin but if possible I like to improve it to above the $0.05.

That's all for now - - I'll keep studying this ... What I am trying to do is draw some conclusions as to the circumstances under which we will want to swap the purchase cost (it's clear to me that, most of the times, once you know what your cost is, you will try to lock in your margin by doing a swap using your revenue stream; i.e., the Mbv basis).


Thanks again for all your time and patience.

Mariella

See the note below from Paul. The contract expires on Dec 31, 2002, and as advised by Hilda, Procaribe would need to provide a 90 days prior notice to extend it(Section 4.02 of the Tallaboa Pier Agreement),  if there is the need to do so under the Credit Agreement. This however would be a matter (hopefully) under Mirant's watch.

Subject:	Tallaboa Pier Use and Maintenance Agreement


Coralina,

The above referenced document between The Puerto Rico Ports Authority and The Protane Corporation is due to expire December 31, 2002 (Section 4.01). ProCaribe and the owner of EcoElectrica will make a decision next year about whether or not to extend.

Note that the LPG Storage and Services Agreement between ProCaribe and Eco states in Section 23.2.1(c) that ProCaribe will exercise all renewal or extension options under the Tallaboa Pier Agreement for the life of the LPG Storage and Services Agreement. Eco may, however, request or consent to the termination of the Tallaboa Pier Agreement as outlined in Section 23.2.1(b). 

The Tallaboa Pier Agreement calls for ProCaribe and/or EcoElectrica to pay an annual fee of $200,000 plus escalation (Section 5.01). In return, ProCaribe and Eco receive First Preferential Use of the pier (Section 3.01 and 5.01) and do not pay dockage or wharfage (Section 5.01).

When the Eco deal was first put together, it was probably considered to be important that Eco have the First Preferential Use of the pier during Phase I of the project. It was expected that an LPG ship was going to be docked at Tallaboa Pier a large percentage of the time. As it turned out, there were no conflicts with other vessels as we are the only ones that have used the pier for the past few years. The pier could get other traffic in the future but that only matters if Eco is burning LPG. 

It would be interesting to know if the Credit Agreement requires Eco to maintain its First Preferential Use rights for the life of the PPOA. Since LPG is Eco's back-up fuel, there is a possibility that the banks are requiring it.  

Let me know if you need me to take this any further.


Paul

The meeting with Mr. Ram?n Gonz?lez, president of Empire Gas Company went as follows:

?	A written offer of $0.04 cpg for the throughput and the terminals value added strengths was handed to Mr. Gonz?lez.  It also mentioned that such agreement was to be supported with a contract covering all the legal aspects of such throughput.  Mr. Gonz?lez mentioned that the $0.04 cpg was an offer somewhat high but he was going to consider it along with PDVSA's next year price offer.  He thinks that PDVSA's FOB price should be MB flat and that Enron should have the capability of getting a better price for a vessel so that the landed price is somewhat cheaper than that of using PDVA's vessels.  He also said that effective November 1, 2001 all of Puerto Rico volume except for San Juan Gas will belong to him. (Mr. Humberto Berrios Tropigas / Progas) assures us that he has not  close any deals with Empire and that he is waiting for an offer from ProCaribe for November / December and hopes that we can offer him a MB + 9.50 and is also waiting for our year 2002 offer.  

?	Mr. Gonz?lez considers PDVSA's next year prices as too high and that another alternative should be looked to see if prices are better (this is a tactic he uses to show PDVSA the new price so that PDVSA lowers their price to him).  He said that he does not trust the Phoenix Park Group (Trinidad & Tobago) at all.  Plus he knows that all of their volume is committed to their customers.  He is concerned with the way the Venezuela Government has been behaving lately and he thinks President Chavez is a communists.  He is concerned with future business deals that a sudden change in Government (towards the left) might bring.  He also said that PDVSA still is his best option as it has been for the last fifteen years.

?	He asked us if ProCaribe was for sale and that he will like to be considered as a future buyer.  He asked us to please inform of his petition.

The meeting went very well and cordial.  We consider it as a good starting point.  We think that the next step to follow is for William Mauc? to push PDVSA to pursue this deal.  Our next meeting with Mr. Gonz?lez should include the group so he can see Enron commitment to this throughput proposal.

Saludos

Paul, we are done as per your proposal below.  We will invoice the full volume in four parcels, as follows:

2,600 MT @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)

2,800 MT @ 58.125 cents  (This will be a provisional invoice and will be adjusted to reflect Average June Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.25 cents per gallon)

1,768 MT @ 58.125 cents (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon  ($0.51125 + $0.07 = $0.58125))

Please confirm your agreement to the above by return.

Greg,

Please call me regarding this note. I just want to be sure that everyone is in agreement. Javier feels that EGM promised EGA a 5-cent margin on LPG sales to Humberto. The lower cost LPG therefore benefits the Progasco Sales Transaction & EGM rather than ProCaribe & EGA. Your thoughts???

Gentlemen,

It seems to me that the price should be MB plus $0.12 for every month. The last cargo purchase saw a value gain for ProCaribe through optimization of the pricing structure by using price swaps. The prices below transfer that value gain away from ProCaribe. I cannot tell if the value is being transferred to the Progasco sale or to Tropigas. Comments???

In order to provide Humberto the short term supply we have been talking about for a while, and to secure a 5-cent margin for Procaribe as agreed to with Mariella, we will sell him the product with the following terms:

Term:	4 months @ 1MM gal/mo.
Start Date:  On closing of Progasco sale (June)

Pricing: (depending on month of delivery)
	June		MB + 11.25
	July		MB + 11.00
	August		MB + 12.00
	September	MB + 12.00
	October		MB + 12.00

Miguel has a model contract approved by Coralina with the rest of the standard terms.  I suggest we send it to Humberto so he is ready to go by closing.

Miguel,
=20
Contractually: On the positive side, Section 7.3.1.1 says that "EcoElectric=
a and Terminal Operator shall use reasonable efforts to integrate Terminal =
Operator's then committed LPG purchases and supply arrangements into EcoEle=
ctrica's overall LPG purchase and supply program". However, Eco's borrowing=
 rights under Section 7.3.2.4 could give ProCaribe its biggest problem. Eco=
 can drawdown ProCaribe's inventories to 3250 MT as long as there is a vess=
el loading or en route with at least 8,000 MT of LPG for EcoElectrica. If t=
he cargo takes 14 days to arrive, ProCaribe's needs would be 6,300 MT durin=
g those 14 days. We need to have a provision in our deal with PDVSA that gi=
ves ProCaribe the option to receive 4,000 - 5,000 MT on short notice if Eco=
 declares a Second Period Supply Disruption.
=20
Mechanically: I cannot think of any reasons why ProCaribe would be unable t=
o supply both EcoElectrica and all of Puerto Rico's LPG distributors. The d=
ifference between what we are hoping for under the PDVSA agreement and what=
 ProCaribe was doing last year is the loading of an additional 175,000 gall=
ons (335 MT) per day into trucks. That would be an additional 16 trucks per=
 day. If EcoElectrica was at 100% output, they would be consuming 1900 MT p=
er day and the rest of the island would be using 450 MT per day. As long as=
 your heaters can warm-up a total of 2500 MT per day, you should be in the =
clear.
=20
Inventory Requirements: EcoElectrica, today, is at risk if there is an exte=
nded disruption in its LNG supply. That risk will be there, regardless of w=
hether or not ProCaribe does the PDVSA deal. Eco must keep a minimum supply=
 of 15 days of fuel on site. Typically, an LNG ship arrives when there is 6=
 days of LNG in the tank. That means that Eco must have 9 days of LPG and/o=
r diesel. As of August 31st, Eco had 5 days of LPG (9250 MT) and 4 days of =
diesel (2,800,000 gallons) on-site. If Eco were suddenly faced with a disru=

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should 
pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly 
adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by 
paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations 
which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the 
market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent 
and $164M of property tax.

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

I met with Johnny R. Fern?ndez, Esq., Executive Director of Codezol, C.D. (Corporaci?n para el Desarrollo de la Zona Libre de Ponce, C.D.).  Codezol, C.D. is the Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce, PR.  I requested information regarding the license to operate a sub zone under the Foreign Trade Zone #163.

Codezol presents the application form to the Free Trade Zone Board in Washington.  The paperwork needed is very extensive, requires specific information and is prepared by a law firm that is specialized in these matters.  He recommends two law firms: Miller & Company, Marshall V. Miller in Washington, DC which as per Codezol is the more experienced in these matters and Phelan & Mitri from Connecticut which where the ones that helped Peerless Oil & Gas get their sub zone.

A good start would be a letter from us which should include our location, legal description of the property, the exact a creage, number of tanks and their capacities, if we are a local company or subsidiary of a US firm.

When I mentioned to Mr. Fern?ndez if we can have a sub zone for ProCaribe and EcoEl?ctrica he doesn't see much problem but he needs to know more details of ProCaribe and EcoEl?ctrica to see if we can ask for one or two sub zones.

BENEFITS OF A SUB ZONE

v	No import tax "Crudita" paid until the sale is done.  You don't pay "Crudita" while the propane is in our tanks or when there is a re export.  It helps with the cash flow.

v	You don't pay personal property tax.  ProCaribe pays around $150,000 per year.

v	You don't pay "Patentes" (%of yearly revenue tax) for any volume of re export.  Only for local sales. 	Patentes are paid to the Pe?uelas Municipality.

Fees of around $25,000 per year have to be paid to Codezol.

Weekly reports of inventories have to be sent to Codezol.  Facilities inspections will be held by Codezol, Crim, and US Customs prior to receiving the license.

The process can take from 9 months to 12 months.  It is faster in products like propane and natural gas, is slower in products like diesel or gasoline.

I spoke with Suzanne Clapp and she told me she doesn't have experience in free trade zones.  She mentioned the name of Armando Lima that can put us in contact with the Free Trade Zone personnel in Puerto Rico.   

It took Peerless 14 months to get the sub zone because there was some "prejudice with oil during the Clinton Administration".  It costs them $60,000 in legal fees and it was done by Phelan & Mitri.

Marshall Miller did the Codezol license and it cost $40,000 in legal fees but it was much less work than the one done by Peerless.

As per Mr. Fern?ndez, the next step is a short history of us so he can understand who we are and what we do.

Any questions please let me know so I can pass it on to Codezol.

Saludos

Suzanne,

I have entered into 2 swap transactions with Lee Jackson to alter the pricing formula for ProCaribe's latest LPG cargo. The swaps will be entered into your LPG book.

The swaps are as follows:

On 8/31/01 you "sold" 1,510,900 gallons (2900MT) of September MB NON TET Propane at a price of $0.41250 per gallon.

On 8/29/01 you "sold" 1,146,200 gallons (2200MT) of October MB NON TET Propane at a price of $0.41875 per gallon.

 
For the sake of clarity:

"Sold" means that you will pay Lee the average of the month MB NON TET propane price for the months of September and October ("floating price") for the volumes specified above. In turn, Lee will pay you the fixed prices stated above for the volumes above.

As a result of these swaps, the price ProCaribe pays you for the recent cargo will be as follows:

2,900 MT (1,510,900 gallons)    @ Average September Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 7.063 cents per gallon   ($0.41250 + $0.07063 = $0.48313)

2,200 MT (1,146,200 gallons)    @ Average October Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.438 cents per gallon   ($0.41875 + $0.06438 = $0.48313)

Remainder of Cargo (approx. 3400 MT)	@ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon  ($0.41313 + $0.07 = $0.48313)

Note that NET OF THE SWAPS, you will receive a fixed price of $0.48313 per gallon with which you will pay PDVSA.

Note:  Bill of Lading date was August 27, 2001

Basis:		521 Gallons/MT

Please confirm your agreement.

Paul

Paul,

The information that follows was provided by Luis Ayala Col?n Sucrs., Inc, the PDVSA shipping agency in Puerto Rico.  These are actual port costs using the LPG/C Nelly Maersk which is the vessel servicing Empire Gas Company this year.  

The following are the port costs estimates (quite close):

	1.  Barrels discharge per trip at CORCO - 30,000 bbls., Tropigas - 24,000 bbls., Liquilux - 20,000 bbls.,  One trip is three 	     ports and another trip is two ports per month.

	2.  Discharge rates were given to us on an hourly basis and the agents took the average time per docking:  CORCO -                          	    48 hours or 625 bbls/hr., Tropigas - 28 hours or 857 bbls/hr., Liquilux - 20 hours or 1,000 bbls/hr., 

	3.  Port costs at: 

		Tallaboa $18,000
		CORCO $18,000
		Tropigas $13,000
		Liquilux $17,000

	    Liquilux port costs are per the Port of Ponce tariffs which are different from the Puerto Rico Ports Authority tariffs 
                    which apply to Tallaboa, Guayanilla and San Juan.  At San Juan (Tropigas) the tug boats cost less due to the fact 
                    that all tug boats companies are docked within the San Juan bay.

	4.  Port costs are not included in the vessel costs.  

	5.  Port costs includes dockage, wharfage, harbor pilots, tug boats, and harbor fees.  ProCaribe charges the 
                     dockage and warfage to the shipping agent.  All these costs are charged by the shipping agent to the owner of the  	     vessel, the owner of the vessel then charges the charter party.

	6.  Other costs:  Crudita - $4/barrel., Customs - $610.00 (Custom entry service $125, Custom duty deposit $485)., 
                     Laboratories - $135/test (3 - 5 per ship)., Inspectors - $0.1780 per long ton., Loss Control Agent - $0.35 per MT., 

	7.  Days steaming from Jose Venezuela to Puerto Rico and in between island ports:  

	              Jose to Puerto Rico (Ponce, Guayanilla and Tallaboa) - 36 hours
	              San Juan to Jose - 46 hours
	              CORCO to Ponce - 2 hours
	              Ponce to San Juan - 14 hours
       	              CORCO to San Juan - 14 hours

	     These timings are from dock to dock.

	8.  ProCaribe annual expenses:

	            Year				2000		2001 (1CE)
	            Payroll				$554M		$525M
	            O + M				$1,447M	$1,534M	
	            Depreciation			$475M		$492M
    	           Taxes other than income		$211M		$250M
        	           Other expenses			$160M		$86M

I hope this figures can help you in your model.  If you have any questions please call me.

Saludos

The following cost of sale calculations shows the estimated margins for May, June and July based on our actual customers.  The way this vessel was purchased gave ProCaribe an extra one cent in our margin.

Thanks so much and GREAT WORK!
Miguel, can you translate the pricing below (given the decreasing tendency of MtB) into terminal margins per gallon?  How does this compare to our normally expected margin of 5 cents or so?  You can do this for sales for which prices are known; if you wish, estimate the rest.
Thanks

Mariella,

Below is the pricing for ProCaribe's LPG purchase. There are four price tranches. The two fixed price tranches of 2600MT and 1768 MT represent volumes sold and yet-to-be-sold during the time frame April 16th to May 31st. Note that ProCaribe's revenue stream for the portion of LPG sold during the second half of April (~1400 MT) was based on Mont Belvieu of $0.543/gallon. Month-to-date Mont Belvieu for May is $0.5145/gallon. ProCaribe's revenue for volumes sold in May (~2900 MT) will be based on the average Mont Belvieu price for the entire month.

Pricing of this cargo has worked out such that ProCaribe will make approximately 1-cent per gallon more margin than it would had they purchased LPG at a 7-cent per gallon premium to average Mont Belvieu for the month in which the sales occurred.

Paul

Miguel,

Please note the following prices for Mont Belvieu Non-TET Propane:

5/16	$0.51188
5/17	$0.50563  = Bill of Lading Date
5/18	$0.51625
5/21	$0.51875

Avg. for 3 days around bill of lading  5/16,17,18  =  $0.51125

Avg. for 5/17,18,21  =  $0.51354


Pricing ($/gallon) for the 10,068 MT cargo from PDVSA will be as follows:

2,600 MT @ $0.58396  =  $0.58625  +  ($0.51125 - $0.51354)

1,768 MT @ $0.58125  =  $0.51125  +  $0.07

2,800 MT @ Average June Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.25 cents per gallon *

2,900 MT @ Average July Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.00 cents per gallon *


Basis:  521 gallons per MT

  * A provisional price of $0.58125 per gallon will be used for initial payment for these volumes. Adjustments will be made once final prices for June and July are known.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Best Regards,

Paul

Pdvsa just revert with their comments and economies.  There is a difference of
0.9 usc/gallon.  Main reason for this is that they have to use a vessel of only 8,500 MT
 in order to be able to use it for the LPG distribution in Venezuela as well.
 We are going to have a meeting next monday July 2nd to discuss the proposal.
With  their numbers Enron still could receive about 4 usc/g ( 3 for ProCaribe).

Well done and good luck.  When is your meeting?  Federico will you forward a copy of the Poten LPG study.  

William I do not know if you have read about the commitment PDVSA and the government have made to work together on energy issues but the President of the company was in PR last week and perhaps this could be spun into a good public relations move for PR and PDVSA.  In addition you should mention the amount of LPG that came from Africa into this terminal last year and that this deal could reduce the risk of this happening in the future.   Paul has this information.  

Thanks GSVC

Greg and Paul, please find attached a draft of the material to be use

   with the latest Paul?s spreadsheet, are the Vessels Cost per day ,which
   I have adjusted according to the market indications given to one
   of the ship brokers being used by Pdvsa ( Marino Shipping Routes C.A).
    
   There are some information still missing about the terminals , which I appreciate
    that you find for me.

    I have agreed with Pdvsa to exchange all the information (without any Proposal)
    and once we have an agreement on the numbers ,then we will proceed with
    the negotiation of the proposal.
    
    Please review and reply to proceed accordingly.

Greg,

Your assumption is not correct. The purchase contract calls for ProCaribe to pay the 3-day average Mont Belvieu around the bill of lading date plus 7 cents per gallon. Most likely that will be May 17, 18, and 21. I am proposing that the price formula be changed such that a % of the cargo will be a Fixed Price, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for May, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for June, and another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for July.

Since the forward curve increases between May and July, you should expect that if your May volume is priced at avg. of May plus 7 cents, then the June volume will be priced at the average of June plus something less than 7 cents, and the July volume will be priced at average of July plus something also less than 7 cents.

I am sending a seperate e-mail regarding the current status of the pricing of this cargo.

Paul

Progas pays for the 15 days.  
I assume that premium 1 means a penny and premium 2 means 2 pennies.  Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?

Miguel

How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.  Where are you on your investigation of making Procaribe and Eco free trade zones.  This should help you with your cash flow and transhipments since you do not pay taxes until you pay the taxes until you sell the product in PR.  Do you know how long it takes to do this?

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

Subject:	Re: Next Cargo   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

We will be able to have $800M by week end of July 22, 2001.  We have been fact finding about the ProCaribe free trade zone.  It took Peerless Oil and Gas fourteen months to have their zone.  Probably we can have ours between 10 and 12 months.  I will let you know later more about the free trade zone.

Progas pays for the 15 days.  
I assume that premium 1 means a penny and premium 2 means 2 pennies.  Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?

Miguel

How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.  Where are you on your investigation of making Procaribe and Eco free trade zones.  This should help you with your cash flow and transhipments since you do not pay taxes until you pay the taxes until you sell the product in PR.  Do you know how long it takes to do this?

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

Subject:	Re: Next Cargo   

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Paul

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the payment terms?  How are you with cash?

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco		1,100,000 gallons

* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl?ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

William,

The attached spreadsheet contains an analysis that I did on the freight cost associated with delivering LPG from Venezuela to Empire versus delivering it to ProCaribe. The numbers could use some refining but show approximately a $30/MT cost difference for PDVSA. See the page titled "Transport". Let's discuss ASAP. I am at x-55855.

Please be advised that the pricing for the May LPG delivery into Puerto Rico has been changed as follows:


Previous:	10,000 MT +/- 5%	@ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon


Current:		 2,600 MT (1,354,600 gallons)    @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)

		Remainder of Cargo	@ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon


Basis:		521 Gallons/MT


		Note that the price component (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21) will be equal to zero if 		the bill of lading date is May 18th. Otherwise, this component will result in a small increase or decrease in the pricing. ELFI was able to give ProCaribe an 		"almost" Fixed Price on the 2600 MT by hedging Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, and 21 (corresponds to a B/L date of May 18th). ProCaribe bears the 			risk/benefit of a different B/L date.


The 2600 MT for which the price is fixed, represents the amount of LPG that has been sold to-date since borrowing began in April. The price that ProCaribe will receive for the volumes sold in April will be based on a Mont Belvieu price of 54.281. The fixed price of the upcoming cargo could be thought of as April Mont Belvieu plus 4.344 cents per gallon (54.281+4.344 = 58.625). The price that ProCaribe will receive for the volumes sold May 1st through May 9th should be thought of as being based on May Mont Belvieu through May 9th which is ~51.9 cents. The fixed price of the upcoming cargo could be thought of as May 1st-9th Mont Belvieu plus 6.725 cents per gallon (51.9+6.725 = 58.625).  

Any hedging of the remainder of the volume should be done once the prices are known for May 17, 18, and 21st. ProCaribe is taking a risk that Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, and 21 could be higher than May 10th - 31st. That would make the Mont Belvieu average used in calculating the cost of the cargo a higher number than the Mont Belvieu average used in calculating ProCaribe's sales price. The cost of hedging out this risk is 1-1.5 cents. ProCaribe should just take the risk.  
 

Regards,

Paul

How are you today? Have you had a chance to take a look at the calculations that I sent to you? Let's discuss at your earliest opportunity. Could you forward to me your telephone number.
