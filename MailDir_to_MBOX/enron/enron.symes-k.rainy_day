Thorofare: Yellowstone=01,s Heart of Gold

By Win Goodbody

Thorofare Creek.  Two Ocean Pass.  Atlantic Creek.  Yellowstone Point.  Ope=
n
Creek.  To hunters from around the world these are more than just names of
geographic features in northwest Wyoming=01,s Teton Wilderness.  They are
legendary places renowned for abundant wildlife in the most remote area of
the US=01,s lower 48 states.  The closest road is 30 miles distant.  Right =
next
door is Yellowstone National Park.  For those who know some part of the
thousands of square miles of rugged terrain here on either side of the Park
border, the area is simply =01&Thorofare=018.  Inside this one word fits th=
e very
heart of Yellowstone country, the distilled essence of everything that is
great about this crown jewel of America=01,s natural heritage.

Thorofare really refers to two main drainages that grow from steep mountain
creeks into larger rivers that meander through flat, wide valley bottoms
before merging.  Each drainage is initially tight and dense, spilling down
between rocky Absaroka peaks, but then broadens and opens into vast meadows
etched with old oxbows where waterways shift back and forth.  The Thorofare
Creek drainage starts on the north face of Younts Peak near the Continental
Divide and heads north before turning west.  The Yellowstone River drainage
starts on the south side of Younts and goes west before turning north.

These two rivers wind around opposite sides of the massive Thorofare Platea=
u
and then join just before entering Yellowstone National Park=01,s southeast
corner.  It seems odd that the river downstream of the confluence is called
the Yellowstone, for before they meet Thorofare Creek looks larger than the
Yellowstone River.  From this point the Yellowstone flows north into the
Park until it hits Yellowstone Lake, some 15 miles away.

Thorofare hosts the bulk of its human visitors during one concentrated
period each year.  Every autumn in those parts of Thorofare outside the
Park, hunters arrive to pursue elk, moose, deer, and other game.  Whether o=
r
not they are in harmony with the letter or, more importantly, the spirit of
the law, there are in fact many permanent hunting camps scattered throughou=
t
Thorofare and the Teton Wilderness, and it is clear that hunting is big
business.

Miniature towns spring up as large groups with convoys of horses haul in
everything needed to live well for weeks on end.  The more developed camps
feature raised platforms, log furniture, corrals, and enormous 50 gallon
steel drums in which food is secured from bears.  Though there are usually
ample numbers of animals to hunt outside the Park, guides and outfitters
will place salt licks just beyond the Park boundary in an effort to lure
creatures out and ensure that paying clients have something to blast away
at.

Other people, far fewer in number, come to hunt with camera and binoculars,
either in summer or fall.  For them, just being in Thorofare and feeling th=
e
pulse of this magnificent land is sufficient payback for the long journey
in.  Here are also to be found animals that cannot be hunted, such as wolve=
s
and grizzly bears.  Despite all of the usual problems that will have an
impact on Thorofare=01,s future, this is still a staggering swath of relati=
vely
undisturbed earth where, to paraphrase the Wilderness Act of 1964, =01&=01(=
man is
a visitor who does not remain.=018

All told, several thousand people might pass through during the annual
window of milder weather.  But for more than half the year, from early
November until early June, no one comes.  With the first real snowfall the
back country falls quiet and the last humans decamp for town.  A visit to
Thorofare in winter is therefore a chance to experience real isolation and
behold Yellowstone=01,s unique beauty during a harsh season.

This was the fourth leg of our Yellowstone traverse and a return to longer
distance travel.  The second and third legs of the winter had each been hal=
f
as long as the one before (the first leg was 130 miles, the second was 60,
the third was 35).  We had to break out of this pattern, I realized, or we
would soon be down to day trips of several hundred yards.  A trip into
Thorofare was just the thing to turn our attentions back to bigger miles an=
d
more challenging territory.  We figured it would take two weeks to cover th=
e
80 mile route we had plotted.

Remote in summer, Thorofare is even harder to reach when snow is on the
ground.  Approaching from the south, it=01,s 30 miles through wild Absaroka
territory.  Continuing from where we left off at the end of our last leg
through the northern Gros Ventre Range, we depart from Togwotee Pass in
unsettled weather.  Scattered snow showers swirl around in a black sky.
After several sunny days in town, which I used mainly to sit inside and eat
too much, it looks like we are at last due for some snow.

Amazingly, Togwotee Pass is the first road running east west across the
Continental Divide in Wyoming we have come to since starting our trip almos=
t
two months ago 200 miles to the south.  We will cross only one or two more
roads between here and the northern turnaround point of our traverse at
Bozeman, Montana.  Heading north from Togwotee feels a little bit bleak,
even if we do have a groomed road to follow for the first few miles.  We=01=
,re
really leaving civilization behind and going deep into the woods this time.

Or so we think.  Five miles on, a stunning old wooden lodge appears.  Built
in 1922, it stands on the original highway to Yellowstone and was the
stopping point for many illustrious personalities back in the day.  In more
recent years, I had heard from someone, it was a basic back country lodge
where you could stay or eat.  Just a nice place to stop in.  We ski hungril=
y
to its door, drawn by full-blown fantasies of one more night inside, one
last meal before being forced back into our pathetic floorless tent (it=01,=
s
all we=01,ve brought this time) where we live on dehydrated beans and stick=
s of
butter.

Sadly, Brooks Lake Lodge has turned into an upscale if barely patronized
outfit of late, a way station for private snowmobile tours.  The local
henchman materializes instantly and removes us from the bar before we can
even inquire what=01,s on tap or find out if any of the paying guests want =
to
put some money on a game of billiards.  I ask whether, by any chance,
there=01,s some unheated back hallway in employee housing where we could ma=
ybe
curl up in our sleeping bags for the night?  The response is as warm as a
mid February night in Yellowstone: No can do.  We decide to retreat just
beyond the fascist compound=01,s perimeter to erect our shantytown for the
night.  It=01,s now snowing in earnest.

It=01,s hard to explain the kind of magnetic appeal these last outposts of
humanity exert on me as we leave on a trip.  It seems to be getting worse a=
s
the winter wears on.  Each leg is just a little harder to embark on.  Each
departure day (especially if the weather is dark) seems a little grimmer.  =
I
feel I am looking for a reason - any reason - to put off for one more day
the inevitable wilderness death march that is sure to come.  Any diversion
at all to hang us up.  To be rebuffed at the lodge when comfort is so close
seems unbearable.  I=01,m just not ready to crawl into the sleeping bag aga=
in.
I almost want to shell out the $150 for a night indoors.

And it=01,s not just major, obvious pitstops like a lodge in front of my sk=
is
that make me want to postpone the inevitable.  Outward bound on our drives
from town to trailheads now, every little gas station we pass suddenly look=
s
like a great place to stop and explore.  They might have precious local
gifts we can find nowhere else.  They might sell those orange hats that say=
,
=01&My wife thinks I=01,m hunting=018!  I need one of those.  Or maybe a pi=
ece of
petrified wood with =01&Wyoming=018 emblazoned on it.  Definitely need one =
of
those in the pack.  And I must get another road atlas for my collection.

Any kind of establishment that has anything for sale must be investigated.
Look over there!  Don=01,t we need a 300 pound chainsaw wood carving of a m=
oose
head?  What, to take with us?  Can we stop at this bathroom?  We just
stopped 15 minutes ago.  I know, but I don=01,t want to miss one.  Should w=
e
stop for lunch here?  We already had lunch.  Twice.  I know but=01(we may n=
ever
eat again.  Whoa there!  A point of historical interest!  Can we stop and
read about how trapper Bucky nearly starved to death at this very spot 150
years ago and had to resort to eating the leather from his snowshoes?  We
really shouldn=01,t.  Hits too close to home.  Plus it=01,s getting late.  =
That=01,s
exactly the point, I think.  If I can just stall for another hour or two we
may have to wait another day before casting off.  Like sand slipping throug=
h
my fingers, the few remaining opportunities for frittering away time vanish
into the air.  The trailhead is getting dangerously close now.  Doesn=01,t =
look
like there=01,s any way out.

Wait!  Turn this car around!  I can=01,t leave without knowing who won the
match between the Jersey Penguins and the Hosers!  I try to disguise my
inadequate knowledge of pro sports by keeping the references vague.  Leave
off a city name here, the full team moniker there.  I=01,m sure as heck not
going to risk mentioning a specific sport by name.  Cast the net wide, I
think.  Better chance of getting something.  Could be baseball, basketball,
hockey, Australian football, or cricket I=01,m talking about.  Jersey might
mean New Jersey, or maybe I=01,m off in Britain following a darts tournamen=
t.
Have to keep Joe guessing.

There must be a pro sport game going on somewhere in the world at this
moment.  And I have to know the outcome!  I=01,m hoping cricket.  Don=01,t =
those
things go on for days?  We can=01,t leave now, not when Sri Lanka might be
trailing Norway by hundreds of points or baskets or yards or whatever they
have in that game.  Come on Sri Lanka!  No dice.  A last whimpering claim
that I=01,ve forgotten my stock car racing magazines and can=01,t go forwar=
d
without them does nothing to slow the car down.  The trailhead looms.  I=01=
,m
being delivered to my doom with no delay.

The morning after being denied our civil rights at the Brooks Lake Lodge, w=
e
awake to more snow.  Not what I was hoping to see.  It=01,s coming down.  N=
ot
really dumping, but steadily snowing.  We may have a few inches from the
night.  This is the first real accumulation from a storm we=01,ve seen this
winter, and it has an immediate effect on our mood.  Before I=01,m more tha=
n
three words into the sentence I=01,ve crafted to subliminally convince Joe =
that
maybe we should stay put and see what the weather does, he practically
shouts his assent to the plan.  Apparently we=01,re on the same wavelength.
It=01,s the first rest day we=01,ve taken on the trail, the first day we ha=
ven=01,t
packed up and kept moving no matter what.  The very thought of sitting
around drinking endless cups of tea and reading sounds like heaven to me.
And then there is the lodge with roaring fireplaces and gourmet food just
across the way.  We vow to take a second shot at infiltrating the posh
resort.

It turns out the lodge is open to the public (read: unwashed masses) for
lunch, so we slink over and decide to pay way too much for a fabulous four
course meal.  The fact that we are now actual customers parting with dollar=
s
and not marauding visigoths (for the moment) keeps the welcoming committee
from last night at bay.

I still feel like there is a closed circuit camera pointing at our table an=
d
burly guards in an underground command center watching our every move, but
for the moment everything is ok.  Here it is day 2 and Joe=01,s having the
mushroom fettuccine while I demolish the linguine with cream sauce.  Our
only concern is the size of the portions, but we figure this isn=01,t the u=
sual
=01&all you can eat=018 joint we=01,re accustomed to and that a request for=
 =01&some
more=018 wouldn=01,t be well received.

Now that we=01,ve taken the financial hit, we decide to get our money=01,s =
worth.
We have justified the significant outlay for lunch as tickets to a day
indoors (the snow continues to fall).  Even though the restaurant closes at
2:30 PM, we hang around and play pool in the bar.  Then we settle in with
some magazines and try to strike up a conversation with the bartender.
Maybe we can find some common ground that will lead to an invitation to sta=
y
inside tonight.  Doesn=01,t happen.  I watch him periodically out of the co=
rner
of my eye to see if he=01,s whispering into some tiny microphone on his lap=
el,
reporting back to the command center on our whereabouts.

Come 5 PM Joe is still inside by the fire, reading and smiling at every
staff member who passes by.  They seem to be appearing with some frequency,
maybe to check whether he=01,s still there.  He=01,s doing his best to look=
 like a
legitimate overnight patron, but they=01,re not buying it.  They=01,re prob=
ably
trying to decide which of several different lodge security forces should be
tasked with removing him.

Meanwhile I=01,ve reached my shame threshold and have gone outside for a sk=
i
around the lake, not wanting to be present for the inevitable hands-on
eviction that will occur as soon as our goon friend from last night returns=
.
  Sure enough, around 6 PM Joe is formally asked to leave.  He goes without
a fight and heads back to the tent to inform me of the defeat.

As much as we might want to, it=01,s pretty clear by now that we are not go=
ing
to be spending the rest of the winter at Brooks Lake Lodge.  I don=01,t eve=
n
think we can get away with our 7 hour lunch scam again.  I=01,m picturing a=
n
all out offensive by the authorities to remove us from the immediate area
(and maybe Wyoming) starting first thing in the morning if they so much as
catch a glimpse of us.  We have to move.

Our choices are to turn around and ski the five miles back to the road wher=
e
we=01,ll start hitch hiking south to Mexico and a sunny beach, or to push o=
n.
We decide on the latter and saddle up on the morning of day 3.  We=01,re
Absaroka bound.  Not a peep from the lodge as we head across Brooks Lake.  =
I
look around half expecting to see artillery pieces on surrounding peaks
swiveling towards us, trained and ready just in case we change our minds an=
d
try to head inside again.

But the layover was not a total loss.  Far from it.  In fact, the poor
weather motivated us to consult our maps for the first time and see exactly
what we were getting into.  It was a bit of a wake up call.  We seem to be
in the habit of planning most sections of our trip on very large scale maps=
.
  Restaurant place mats of Wyoming, road atlases, maps of the US hanging in
drug stores, globes of the earth: all of these have at one point or another=
=20
been the research tool of choice for plotting our way through Greater
Yellowstone.

The only problem with these topographic specimens is that they yield none o=
f
the low-level detail necessary to actually navigate day by day.  What ends
up happening is that the night before we leave on a leg (assuming we have
had the foresight to get our hands on a quad or other smaller scale map) we
sit down to examine how we might actually get through wherever it is we are
heading.  Suddenly the landscape is full of cliffs, avalanche slopes,
gorges, and dense woods.

It=01,s sort of like tracing a finger across a map of Arizona thinking it m=
ight
be a fun hike, then realizing you just crossed the Grand Canyon.  What
looked pretty straightforward on the map of Wyoming that flashed across the
TV screen during an evening weather report now looks downright impossible.
These are usually quiet moments as we each pore over the maps and realize
that there is no way we can go where we thought we could.

Spreading out all our quad maps on the table in the lodge after lunch (I
glance nervously at the bartender to see if this breach of decorum might
prompt a call to the command center), we get a rude shock.  There is no way
we are going to be able to follow the Continental Divide north from Brooks
Lake to the headwaters of Thorofare Creek as was our plan.  The Divide here
is a featureless plateau above treeline, and getting on and off would
require crossing steep slopes.  With this year=01,s poor snow conditions, n=
ot
to mention the storm that was currently unloading, it would be plain foolis=
h
to head up there.  Plus we don=01,t have a real tent, and our experience on
Island in the Sky during leg 2 has already filled my annual quota for
traveling (not to mention camping) on exposed plateaus in high winds during
whiteouts.

It=01,s as if there is a blackboard in front of us with our route chalked o=
n
it.  We get out the eraser and wipe the slate clean.  We have to rethink th=
e
entire thing, or at least the first half.  We notice there is a low route
option.  It winds around and follows drainages where the Continental Divide
route is straight, but there are no dangerous slopes and it stays mostly on
valley bottoms.

We hadn't thought of going this way before because of dreadfully dense wood=
s
and the potential for out of body bushwhacking experiences, but now we see
there are trails we could follow.  It might not be too bad.  Yeah, I=01,ve
heard that one before.  Without much discussion we mentally draw the new
route up on the board.  We=01,re happy about it.  It feels like a huge reli=
ef
now to know that we aren=01,t going off to be sacrificed to the weather god=
s.
The optimism about our new route more than offsets any bad feelings from th=
e
Brooks Lake Lodge affair, and we set off excited and energetic.  I am rarin=
g
to go and don=01,t want to return to town anymore.

For two days we hack our way toward the South Buffalo Fork drainage.  The
going isn=01,t great, we see some of the same bottomless, collapsible junk
we=01,ve come to expect and love, but we are moving forward at least.  By
afternoon of day 4 we arrive at a hunting camp on the side of a large meado=
w
below Pendergraft Peak.  In a low snow year such as this it is very easy to
spot these camps, some more elaborate than others.   The site of crude log
structures and a large metal drum inspires us to make ourselves a home away
from home.

We dig a large rectangular pit down to the ground and gather wood for a
fire.  In an hour we are as comfortable as one could be, in or out of town.
There are some large trees above us, and even though snow is falling we are
sheltered.  We stoke the fire, gaze out into the Absaroka night, and enjoy =
a
break from the brutal cold that has followed us on past legs.  One of my
favorite rationalizations is that it can=01,t be brutally cold if it=01,s
storming, and vice versa.  So the good news tonight is that it isn=01,t
brutally cold.  Because it=01,s storming.

The next morning, after more consulting with the maps, we make the second
major change in our route.  As snow continues to fall and we look at the
area around Younts Peak on the quad (for the first time, of course), we
notice what a perfect avalanche slope our route crosses.  No way to avoid
it.  This is where we planned to get over the Continental Divide, which run=
s
along the spine of the high Absaroka crest in this area.  Worse, we notice
that the trail on the other side of the Divide up Thorofare Creek stops
before the head of the canyon.  There are several miles between where we
would pass Younts Peak and pick up the trail on the valley floor below.
Hmmm.  I wonder why that is?

If there is anything I have learned so far this year, it is to STAY ON THE
TRAIL!  I have told Joe I will pay him $50 for every time I suggest leaving
the trail as long as he hits me with a shovel and prevents me from actually
doing it.  If there is a trail through an area, there is a reason for it.
And if a trail stops somewhere, you can be darn sure there is a reason for
it.  After all, people have been traveling through these parts for hundreds=
,
even thousands of years.  It=01,s highly unlikely that all the nice routes
through haven=01,t been found already.  Adventurous off trail exploration i=
n a
place like the Absarokas certainly has its place, but not when you=01,re tr=
ying
to make good time with heavy packs in February.

Examining the tight spacing of contour lines on our quad map, I see that th=
e
upper Thorofare drainage near Younts Peak looks like prime habitat for some
of my least favorite species, namely cliffs and gorges.  I also suspect
there are healthy local populations of downed trees and impenetrable brush
lurking in there.  Our experiences leaving the trail along the Green River
during leg 1 and then again coming down Redmond Creek during leg 2 have lef=
t
too much emotional scar tissue to ignore.  I don=01,t want to do it again. =
 I
picture us rappelling with packs using the shoelace, our 120 foot section o=
f
8 mm chord.  No thanks.  Afraid that a descent of the upper Thorofare would
use up our lifetime quotas of world class bushwhacking and canyoneering, we
decide to nix it.

But we then see there is another way over the Divide with a trail the whole
way.  Instead of going north from Younts and then west (following Thorofare
Creek) toward the massive meadows where Thorofare Creek and the Yellowstone
River meet, we can go west and then north (following the Yellowstone River)=
.
  I=01,m disappointed we are abandoning Thorofare Creek, but the idea of
descending the Yellowstone River almost from its source (which, as for
Thorofare Creek, is Younts Peak) is thrilling.  A few minutes spent with th=
e
map and we are once again excited and happy with this change of plans.
There is no question it=01,s an easier route.  Also a little bit shorter.

All these breakthroughs in planning and navigation, and it=01,s not even 9 =
am!
Meanwhile, as we realize the route just got easier and shorter, and notice
snow is still falling on and off, and feel the warmth from the morning fire
we have going at possibly the best camp site either one of has ever enjoyed
in winter, what do we decide to do but=01(take another day off and stay put=
!
We=01,re getting used to this rest day thing now.  It=01,s so easy to do.  =
You
simply wake up and announce you=01,re not going anywhere and then go back t=
o
sleep.  Again, I am the first to verbalize the concept, unsure whether Joe
is going to think I have gone completely soft.  The second rest day and it=
=01,s
only day 5?!  Instead he responds as if I=01,ve just offered to carry his p=
ack
the rest of the trip.  A rest day it will be then.  Back to the fire.  Once
again, we are both thinking the same thing.

We spend the day lounging, reading, and collecting enough wood for a massiv=
e
bonfire.  Before this winter, I had only experienced one fire on an
overnight ski trip, and that was in June.  As I had never done it much
before, I never thought of making fire a part of the daily winter camping
routine.  If you had asked me about having a fire in winter before this
year, I probably would have said it was a lot of trouble and not worth the
effort.  But that was before I went ski touring with Joe Hartney.

A veteran of not one but several courses on tracking and outdoor skills
taught by my fellow New Jerseyan Tom Brown, Joe knows what he=01,s doing ou=
t
here.  Thank God one of us does.  I increasingly feel like I am playing
client to Joe=01,s guide.  When it comes to fire, Joe leaps into action lik=
e a
dynamo.  He can have a blaze going in no time and seems to instinctively se=
t
about gathering wood the moment we make camp, much as I grab the shovel and
start excavating a hole for our tent.  After seeing how easy it is to get
one going in the right conditions, I am now a winter fire convert.

A fire in winter is nice anytime anywhere, but in the Absarokas right now
conditions are so fire-friendly that it is almost foolish not to have one.
Like much of the west, the Absarokas are still bone dry after the active
fire year in 2000.  All the fuel that did not burn is still right there
under a few feet of snow.  Actually the Absarokas themselves did not ignite
much this past year, but they could have.  Literally all you need to do to
start a fire is brush the snow off a piece of wood and hold a match to it.
It=01,s astonishing how dry it is.  You can hold a match to boughs on a dea=
d
tree and ignite the entire canopy.  Past blazes killed many trees but left
them standing.  They now fall down all over the place.  There are huge
quantities of partially burned trees on the ground.  It takes little effort
to find and collect them.  Possibly the best thing about winter fires is
that you can have them in places you never could in the summer.  Whereas in
current conditions a summer bonfire in South Buffalo Fork would set Wyoming
on fire, in winter it=01,s perfectly safe and manageable.

We leave our hunting camp on day 6, and even though we have spent almost tw=
o
days there doing nothing but eating and roasting next to the fire it=01,s n=
ot
easy to pack up.  The weather remains spotty and we know we=01,re long over=
due
for a pummeling.  But everything we own is dry and we are fully rested and
beyond well fed.   Building on the obscene amount of food I consumed during
the last stint in town, I have continued to eat like it=01,s the end of the
world and now feel a little sick.  I almost have to force myself to eat
dinner just to keep the weight reduction program for my pack going, but in
truth I=01,m no longer hungry.  I guess there are worse afflictions I could=
 be
suffering from in the back country.

Having gone as far as possible up the South Buffalo Fork, we=01,re ascendin=
g
Lake Creek toward the Continental Divide now.  We have to go up and over to
hit the Yellowstone River, and we pray for a decent weather window to see u=
s
through.  We=01,ve made all the route changes we can at this point.  There=
=01,s no
way to avoid this high crossing.

The first day going up is pretty good.  There are so many trail blazes on s=
o
many trees we may as well have a set of runway lights guiding us along.  We
don=01,t even have to pay attention to follow the trail.  We get some sun
splashes but no real views that paint a picture of the route ahead.  Can=01=
,t
really see where we=01,re going up above.  That night it clears up, which
brings back the cold.  Down to around =01)20 F but we=01,re doing fine.

The next day we get going early and things look good initially.  We approac=
h
within a mile or two of Ferry Lake.  Almost to the Divide.  All the snow
that=01,s been falling over the last few days is really adding up now.  We=
=01,re
glad we don=01,t have to face that blank Younts headwall in what are surely
terrible avalanche conditions.  It=01,s deep powder.  Would be great skiing=
,
but we=01,re breaking trail through it.

A few hundred feet above Ferry Lake is a mild pass over the Divide that wil=
l
deliver us into Woodard Canyon, at the bottom of which we will hit the
Yellowstone River, our highway for the rest of the trip.  Once we reach the
Yellowstone all route-finding and weather issues will be done as it=01,s fl=
at
ground on the trail the rest of the way.  Even if it=01,s a raging storm we
will be in the trees and can slog along ok.  I am looking forward to that
moment even though I know we are sure to hit some terrible snow down there.
I=01,d rather face the bad snow demon than be way up here waiting for the
Blizzard of =01,01 to kick in.

But it will have to be another day that we find out what Woodard Canyon
looks like.  Quickly, thoroughly, the weather turns evil.  It=01,s snowing =
and
blowing, and visibility deteriorates.  We can=01,t actually see Ferry Lake,=
 but
we know it must be there in front of us.  We leave the trees to start
plodding up toward the lake and get a taste of the wind.  It=01,s not an Is=
land
in the Sky gale, but still humming along all the same.  We can=01,t see a
thing.  We blunder around for an hour and incredibly are still not sure
where the lake is.  This is a decent-sized alpine lake, and the fact that w=
e
can=01,t find it doesn=01,t bode well for tracking down the pass above.  We=
 take
cover in a clump of wind-blasted trees to figure out a plan.

I know Joe wants to go up and over regardless.  I=01,m not that concerned a=
bout
finding the pass.  We can get out the compass and start flying blind if it
comes to that.  It=01,s more the question of what descending Woodard Canyon=
 in
the maelstrom will be like that has me worried.  Whereas we can put it in
reverse, retrace our steps, and still find our way back to treeline and a
feasible camp site on this side of the Divide, once we go through the pass
we=01,re just on our own in the whiteout with no knowledge of what lies ahe=
ad.

The voice of fear and paranoia prevails, and I convince Joe that retreat
sounds pretty good right about now.  We turn tail, and though it=01,s not b=
een
more than 25 minutes or so since we entered the stand of trees, our tracks
have been erased by the wind.  We just took it as a given that our tracks
would be there as an umbilical chord for at least a few hours or so in case
we wanted to go back, but they=01,re gone.  We eventually find them by prob=
ing
around for a more supportable strip of snow through the white and manage to
feel our way along.

We make it back into the woods by mid afternoon and set up the tent behind =
a
massive tree that shields us from the wind almost completely.  Time to wait=
.
  The storm rages on.  It=01,s Saturday, and I realize a good friend is hav=
ing
a no-holds-barred 30th birthday bash back in Portland, OR this very night.
The theme is Saturday Night Fever.  What I wouldn=01,t give to be there.
Instead, I=01,m stuck here singing songs from the soundtrack.  The names of
several of them such as =01&Night Fever=018 and =01&Staying Alive=018 seem =
rather
appropriate given our situation.  From Joe=01,s scowl I can tell I=01,m not=
 the
only one wishing I were elsewhere.

We get our window the next day.  It isn=01,t clear, but we can see the lake=
,=20
and once we reach it we can see the pass.  And then it does clear, or at
least on the east side of the Divide.  What we see confirms a half-baked
weather theory we have been working on the last few days.  Coming up the
South Buffalo Fork we have had some real snow, but we have also had nearly
continuous light flurries as something frozen =01) not snow =01) falls from=
 the
air.  It=01,s more like tiny pieces of frozen vapor.  This happens all the
time, even when skies are clear.  It=01,s almost like any moisture that is =
in
the air =01) even if there are no clouds =01) is being squeezed out.

Given the local topography, this makes sense.  The Continental Divide here
is a high mountain crest above 10,000 feet, and all weather moving west to
east gets pushed up over this massive obstacle.  With the lifting, the
moisture has no choice but to come out.  Once we are at the pass and can se=
e
both sides of the Divide we are given a stark piece of visual evidence that
seems to support the theory.  To the west the South Buffalo Fork is a sea o=
f
clouds, while to the east down Woodard Canyon it=01,s a clear, sunny day.

Descending Woodard Canyon is a joy.  The upper reaches of the drainage are
so open we can just cruise along effortlessly.  I have taken up the call I
championed toward the end of leg 1 in the Wind River Range that "it=01,s al=
l
downhill from here".  While technically true, it=01,s also almost 45 miles =
to
the road.  Joe strips his climbing skins off his skis and makes a few turns
in perfect powder.  As we get into the woods we find more of the manic trai=
l
blazes everywhere.  We lose the trail maybe once or twice while crossing
open avalanche chutes but quickly rediscover it.  I have started to
photograph these trail blazes.  I want a collection of them.  What could be
more welcome to the eye of a ski tourer in the Absarokas than big, fresh
trail blazes?  We are really getting lucky with this one.  Before we know i=
t
the downhill stops and we are standing on the bank of the upper Yellowstone
River.

It seems hard to believe, but we have penetrated to the inner sanctum.  How
did this happen?  The moat has been crossed, the turret guards sacked, door=
s
broken down, inner courtyards laid waste, maidens rescued from towers.  We
are there.  We have battled our way through to the most remote place in the
lower 48 states.  And it wasn=01,t even that hard!  We listen as our shouts=
 of
joy echo crazily up into the canyons.  I cringe to think how enraged the
local weather gods will be when they wake up and see that we are already
over the Divide and deep into the promised land.  Nothing they can do about
it now.  Too late to throw the Blizzard of =01,01 at us.  Sorry guys.  Mayb=
e
next time.

I almost want to cry.  It feels indescribable to be here at last.  The
Yellowstone River in February!  35 miles upstream from Yellowstone Lake!  I=
t
seems so wild, so quiet, so alive, so free, and so far away.  It=01,s a vis=
ion
that could sustain decades of wilderness ski touring.  Just the thought tha=
t
one day I might stand right here could get me through anything.

Steep-sided cliffs and slopes of burned, thin trees plummet down on all
sides.  It feels massive, an ocean of wilderness.  There are animal tracks
everywhere.  The river itself is not very wide yet.  After all, we are only
a few miles downstream from its origin on Younts Peak and it=01,s just gett=
ing
going.  But there is no mistaking that with a little care and feeding and a
few hundred miles of flow, this little whipper snapper is going to grow int=
o
one of the great rivers of the Northern Rockies.  We stand and gawk.  The
weather is lovely and late afternoon color starts to paint the scene.  This
is one to remember.

Eventually we snap out of our stupor, somewhat sobered by the realization
that even if we have made it this far we still have a long way to go.  We
continue along the trail (more blazes) for another hour before making camp.
We can just about see the opening ahead where the river veers north into a
broad meadow.  We=01,ll surely reach it tomorrow.  Joe builds a small fire =
from
burned downfall and we settle in for a cold clear night.

Day 9 dawns perfectly clear and still.  A savage cold hangs in the air.  Th=
e
weather gods know that their snow machine is now more or less useless as we
are out of the mountains and can keep going in just about any storm
conditions.  But maybe they can slow us down or at least make life just a
bit uncomfortable with their cold machine.  Either they got a brand new
turbo-charged model for Christmas or some ace mechanic has given the old on=
e
a complete overhaul.  The results are impressive.  It=01,s in the =01)25 F =
range,
which we=01,ve seen before, but this just feels really, really cold.

Joe and I leave the sleeping bags and immediately start doing the cold
weather war dance.  This consists of jumping, hopping, running in place,
swinging arms and legs, blowing on fingers =01) anything to keep the blood
flowing.  The dance is an awkward enterprise to begin with, and the fact
that the snow is completely unsupportable at our camp site doesn=01,t make
things any easier.

You can=01,t just roam around anywhere as one step on any snow we haven=01,=
t
painstakingly packed down will result in a thigh deep plunge.  Not what we
need right now.  We=01,ve each sculpted our own little platforms and stand
watching each other flop and twist.  Talking at this point is strictly
forbidden, aside from the occasional obscenity or prehistoric grunt.  Tra l=
a
la!  Ah, Yellowstone!

Even as we plow into the normal morning routine of making breakfast and
breaking camp, the dance must continue.  This makes for a haphazard on agai=
n
off again kind of progress that would probably be humorous to watch if we
weren=01,t living it.  Everything happens in fits and starts.  You can=01,t=
 get
out your stove, light it, and start melting some snow in one continuous
process.  By that time your hands would be frozen solid.  You have to do on=
e
little thing, then rewarm.  Do the next little thing, then rewarm.

As it so happens, the cooking area we hastily set up the night before is
wedged against the fire pit.  There=01,s not much room for dancing in there=
.
But dancing is mandatory, so I frantically pioneer a new traveling variatio=
n
going back and forth between the cooking area and my platform.  I go and se=
t
up the stove.  Hands are now numb, so I head back to the dance platform,
careful to only step on the few packed footprints that will support my
weight on the way.  Swing, hop, jump, blow, shake.  Now there=01,s some fee=
ling
so it=01,s back to light the stove.

Into the fire pit.  I fill the stove=01,s primer cup with fuel.  Where=01,s=
 the
lighter?  I start searching zipped compartments in my jacket.  Damn zippers=
.
  Can=01,t really operate them with gloves on.  Not in that one.  Hands are
heading south fast.  There=01,s the lighter.  It=01,s in a ziploc bag.  Str=
uggle
to open it.  [ATTENTION!  HANDS WILL BE FROZEN HARD AS WOOD IN 10 SECONDS!]
I=01,m getting an alert from the engine room that I should head back to the
dance platform, but I just want to get the damn lighter out at least on thi=
s
run.  Ziploc won=01,t open.  [BEGIN COUNTDOWN!  10, 9, 8=01(] Got the light=
er out!
  May as well try to start the stove while I=01,m here.  [=01(7, 6, 5=01(] =
 I flick
it.  Nothing.  Shake it.  [=01(4, 3, 2=01(]  I take off my glove to work th=
e
lighter with my bare hand.  Boy is it cold.  It won=01,t light, though it n=
ow
feels like my hand is on fire.  Too late.  [=01(1!  ABORT! ABORT!]

I cram my useless limb back in the glove and hobble over toward the dance
floor.  In my haste to get there I miss one of the packed footsteps.  It=01=
,s
as if I stepped into space.  I plunge in to my thigh, and as I wasn=01,t
expecting this at all and am caught completely off guard, I fall face first
into the snow.  Getting up isn=01,t easy because, again, there=01,s nothing=
 to
push solidly on to right myself except the packed spots, which have now bee=
n
obscured by my floundering.  It=01,s a full snow bath as I thrash around in=
 the
white stuff.  Joe seems to be enjoying this.

At last I get up.  I pull my submerged leg out of the posthole, but my camp
bootie catches and remains lodged three feet down.  My socked foot comes ou=
t
on its own and is instantly ice cold.  I balance on my one foot that has a
bootie, not wanting to have to step into the snow with my sock but pretty
sure that=01,s going to happen.  Somehow I get the wayward bootie back and =
put
it on.  On to the dance floor at last for some super charged disco
movements.  Time to get funky.

And so the morning goes.  The sun hits camp at about 8:30 am and the
temperature leaps.  We realize part of the trouble is that we=01,ve camped =
in a
classic cold air sink right next to the river bottom.  It=01,s taken longer
than usual this morning to activate the 40 or 50 degree temperature swing
we=01,ve come to expect.  It=01,s going to get up to 25 F today.  As we war=
m up we
wonder what all the fuss was about.

This is the day we make it out into the open.  After several hours on the
trail we reach the burned fringes of the first of several large meadows
along the upper Yellowstone.  The snow has been mixed, alternating between
supportable and rotten junk.  Through the burn it=01,s not too bad.  We=01,=
re
actually covering ground.  Late in the afternoon when we try to head
straight across the first open swath of flood plain we find out what bad
snow is all about.

It=01,s thigh deep junk.  Each step goes right to the ground.  We have to l=
ean
back on our skis to keep tips up lest they snag in the ample bushes.  We=01=
,re
snowshoeing, postholing on skis.  The pace is excruciatingly slow.  Looking
behind us it appears we have shoveled a three foot deep trough through the
meadow.  We=01,re submarining along, still about 20 miles from Yellowstone =
Lake
(and from the Lake it=01,s another 15 miles to the road) and have five days=
 of
food left.  At the speed we are going now we could easily run out of food
before we make it out.  Our spirits, previously sky high, turn morbidly
dark.

Reaching the north side of the meadow, we decide to call it a day and resor=
t
to our favorite anti-depressant to lighten things up: fire.  Joe starts
hauling in entire trees.  I begin excavating an enormous rectangular area
for the fire and our camp.  The snow is three feet deep, but I outline a 12
foot by 20 foot area and start digging.   An hour and a half later we have
ourselves an amazing pit beside a beautiful meadow.  It is quite possibly
the greatest camp site ever.  And the sun is still up.  Our moods swing 180
degrees again and we enjoy a long night of stoking the fire and eating.
It=01,s such a beautiful night, we decide to just sleep out under the stars=
 in
our giant pit.  It=01,s going to be another cold one.

I wake up at 3:30am.  My feet are going numb.  I wish I had left a stove se=
t
up next to me so that I could cook a hot water bottle to put in my sleeping
bag but I forgot.  I=01,m conscious of a fiendishly powerful force that see=
ks
to strip any warmth I have accumulated in my bag.  It=01,s horrendous.  Muc=
h
too cold to even get up and try to put on more clothes or get warmer.  I
huddle and fiercely rub my feet together for the rest of the night.  I don=
=01,t
fall back asleep.  This is all part of being admitted to the inner sanctum,
I say to myself.  The good news is that it isn=01,t storming.  Because it=
=01,s
brutally cold.

Joe probably interprets my getting up at 7 am to build a fire as a weird
sign.  Something must be up.  He=01,s done about all the fire building so f=
ar.
I just gather wood.  But here I am out of the bag breaking sticks and
stacking them in a pyramid.  I have waited as long as I can, and it=01,s no=
w
light out.  I need to get warm and I know this is no ordinary morning.  Not
a cloud in the sky and dead calm.  But it=01,s colder than usual.  I can fe=
el
it.  Before I even consult my little key chain thermometer I am fully
prepared to swear that this is the coldest temperature I have ever
experienced.  I just know it is.

When I check the thermometer it=01,s doing something I=01,ve never seen bef=
ore.
Whereas we are used to seeing it maxed out at =01)25 F or so, there is alwa=
ys a
little bit of the red column protruding up from the ball at the bottom.
Just a tiny bit, but enough to see that there is a slight rise above the
ball.  I always assumed that this was the max, that no matter how cold it
got the thermometer would always look the same.  I actually wished I had a
better thermometer that wen lower just so we would know exactly how cold it
really was.

But this morning there is no red column above the ball.  I look closely
because it=01,s such a slight difference I could be wrong.  But there is no
mistaking it.  Only the ball is red.  Nothing above it.  In my dementia I
imagine that even some of the ball is empty.  Yikes.  I estimate by some
mystical and completely unscientific method that it is at least =01)35 F.  =
We
later find out after exiting that on this morning it is =01)30 F at West Th=
umb
on Yellowstone Lake.  We are slightly higher than the lake but more
importantly we are in a massive cold air sink with steep walls on all sides=
.
  It could well be even colder than =01)35 F where we are.

Joe gets up and samples the brisk morning air.  It=01,s too cold for the wa=
r
dance.  We have to get a fire going pronto.  We opt for a =01&hot start=018=
 and
splash stove fuel on the wood to speed things up.  Even white gas is a
little ornery at this temperature and requires an open flame applied for
several seconds to get a response.  But once coaxed over the initial hump,
it goes like crazy in no time.  We spend the next two hours sitting very
close to a raging fire.  When the sun comes up it feels like a blow torch.
We spread our sleeping bags out to thaw, and steam boils off of them.  It=
=01,s
the first real drying sun we=01,ve had this winter.  Despite the inhuman co=
ld,
I know that spring is on the way

For the next four days we continue down the Yellowstone River heading for
Yellowstone Lake.  Just beyond our camp with the swimming pool-sized fire
pit the snow mysteriously turns supportable and we begin to fly.  Each day
our packs are lighter.  The cold relents and it=01,s so hot during the
afternoons that Joe takes off his shirt.  Animals are everywhere.  We=01,re
just another two beasts roaming the valley floor (which is now several mile=
s
across).  We might even smell worse than most of the other ones around.  On
these final days we hit our stride.  This is what we came for.  It=01,s abo=
ut
the most enjoyable time one could have on a wilderness ski trip.  I don=01,=
t
want it to end.  For the moment, Yellowstone is ours.

Mighty Thorofare Creek comes in from the east.  We=01,ll have to come back
another time to explore that universe. We hit the southern boundary of
Yellowstone National Park.  Not far now.  We see wolf tracks.  They=01,ve j=
ust
been here ahead of us.  We spend a day skiing past The Trident, a peak I=01=
,ve
wanted to see for years.  We=01,re in the home stretch, almost to the lake.=
 =20
Colter Peak goes by.  We can see the lake.  We arrive at the blank expanse
of snow and ice, welcomed by two bison who look like they=01,ve been postho=
ling
as much as we have this year.  The Southeast Arm of Yellowstone Lake.

Day 13.  It=01,s the last day to the road.  We have something like 17 miles=
 to
ski to get to Lake Butte near the northeast end of Yellowstone Lake.  That=
=01,s
where the groomed road from the East Entrance comes in.  I know we=01,ll be
able to find a ride there around to the South Entrance, and from there we=
=01,ll
hitch another ride back to Jackson, our home base.

We take off like Norwegian nordic racers on the most supportable snow we=01=
,ve
seen.  We can even kick and glide and are really going for it.  The weather
is sitting on the fence at first.  Looks like maybe the snow machine is
sputtering into life, but then it dies.  Must be out for maintenance.

As we watch, Yellowstone Lake appears out of the clouds and we can see
everything.  All the way across.  We see The Promontory, Frank Island, Dot
Island, even West Thumb.  This is my Park!  We have talked about maybe
trying to ski right across to West Thumb but are wary of open water.  We
stick to the eastern shore and rip past one point after another.

By early afternoon the day has turned into a keeper.  It=01,s sunny with ha=
rdly
any wind.  And we are loose on Yellowstone Lake like a bunch of criminals.
Just having the time of our lives.  We stop briefly when trading leads,
otherwise it=01,s heads down hammering.  But this is not a death march.  Th=
is
is pure joy.  We feel invincible and want to see what we can do.  After a
winter of going slow, we want to push it home.  The smell of the barn is
overwhelming now.  We can taste the finish line.  And it=01,s only 3 PM!

Sometime after rounding Park Point I glimpse Steamboat Point in the far
distance.  I recognize it and know where the road comes in.  It can only be
a few miles now.  After passing Elk Point I start to go flat out.  The
movement feels good.  I don=01,t know how long I can keep it up, but I=01,l=
l stick
with it for now.  Joe sees that it=01,s still about four miles to go and ha=
s
the sense to maintain a normal pace.

I can=01,t even feel my pack.  Either I=01,ve done permanent spinal damage =
and
have lost all feeling in my shoulders or I=01,ve learned how to pack light =
at
last.  Kick and glide!  I can=01,t believe I=01,ve been missing this all th=
ose
years I spent skiing on fixed heel gear!  The snow hisses by.  Home stretch
now.  One more small bay to cross and that=01,s it.  I can see the road cut
ahead.  I feel like I could get airborne with a little more effort.  A
thundering final burst sees me to the line.

That=01,s it.  I=01,m there.  I slide to a stop.  All the cold, all the bad=
 snow.
It=01,s all been wiped away by the last four days.  I want to start shoutin=
g.
We made it!  Yellowstone, my Yellowstone!  Thorofare!  I can=01,t even thin=
k,
and luckily there is no need to.  Joe comes in and we stand there resting.
Then it=01,s time to go ashore.  Just in time for a glorious sunset across =
the
lake.

Luck is with us and we get a ride out first thing in the morning as we had
hoped.  Driving back to Jackson, my thoughts race over the great landscape
we have passed through.  There are so many more trips to do, so much more t=
o
learn.  But for a first time visit to Thorofare we=01,ve done pretty well. =
 Not
only did we get to the place itself, we got to the very heart of its spirit=
.

				Murdoch's  big birds 
				After  years of trying, Rupert Murdoch could be about to plug the gap in  his

It looks like the entire EIS for the Hermiston Power Project is here.
However, I have yet to locate anything on the Chehalis Project
specifically. I have ordered hard copies of both documents from BPA and
they should be here by Monday, at which point I can make copies and send
them out.

Please look this over and let me know if it will still be necessary to
send hard copies. I will be happy to accomodate either way.

> 9.   The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
> 10.  Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the
>      subject.
> 11.  I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
> 12.  I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to
>      pronounce.

> 14.  I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.
> 15.  What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
> 16.  I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.
> 17.  Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of
>      view.
> 18.  It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.
> 19.  Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.
> 20.  No, my powers can only be used for good.
> 21.  I'm really easy to get along with once people learn to worship me.
> 22.  You sound reasonable......time to up my medication.

       leave as well.

NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created=
=20
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various=
=20
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you=
=20
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in you=
r=20
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our=20
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communicatio=
n=20
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improv=
e=20
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minute=
s=20
to complete =01&The Pulse=018 survey.  This annual survey regarding the wor=
k=20
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of t=
he=20
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet an=
d=20
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it=01,s confidential a=
nd=20
your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Natural Gas
Middle Marketing=01,s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month.=
  The=20
significant transaction was a five year, multimillion dollar restructuring=
=20
with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world=01,s largest produc=

of polyvinyl chloride.

Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedge=
d=20
a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil.   Winter=20
Nymex hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of=
=20
the world, Frito Lay.

Pulp & Paper
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com,=20
Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper=20
commodities.  Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price=20
transparency and reliability and access to Enron=01,s online financial mark=
ets.

Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives=
=20
into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron=01,s tradin=
g=20
business.  To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp=
=20
and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

Upstream Origination
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natur=
al=20
gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas=
=20
grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  Through products su=
ch=20
as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA=
=20
creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas=20
infrastructure to be more efficient.  In addition, Upstream Origination=20
transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strateg=
ic=20
assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of th=
e=20
market information created by those assets.

=01&THE PULSE=018 SURVEY RESULTS

As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to =01&The Pulse=018 from=
=20
ENA/EGM/EIM are 689.  This is approximately 30% of all employees.  Since ou=
r=20
goal is a 100% response rate, we have a long way to go!  Please take a few=
=20
minutes to log on and give Enron your thoughts.  The Pulse is located at=20

16. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of 
view.
17. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
18. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
19. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
20. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.
21. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.
22. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.
23. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?
24. Do I look like a people person?
25. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.
26. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.
27. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer.
28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?
29. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed.
30. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.
31. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.
32. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.
33. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1?
34. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.
35. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it?
36. Chaos, panic, & disorder - my work here is done.
37. How do I set a laser printer to stun?
38. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks.

Hello,

I just spoke with Holly at Raphael House.  She said that the meeting on 
Thursday, Nov. 2, will be at 6 pm at the downtown Marriott (1041 SW 
Naito-within walking distance from here).  The meeting will be held on the 
Ballroom Level, which is one floor below the lobby.  If you are interested in 
the 8 am - Noon or Noon - 4 pm shifts on Saturday, you are encouraged to 
attend this meeting.  If you cannot make the meeting, then just show up at 
those times on Saturday.  I plan on going to the meeting on Thursday, so let 
me know if you're interested in going together.

Thanks again and hopefully this is the last e-mail!  ;0

Anna

I don't know if this is at all what you were looking for. Jessica's version

I heard on the radio a couple of days ago they are predicting gas to be
$3.00/gal this summer!!! This just  might  work!

PLEASE NOTE:

I read in the paper yesterday that EXXON posted profits of 12 MILLION
dollars this past Quarter!!!!.  They STOLE that money from us poor suckers
just
as
if they had held us up at gunpoint and ROBBED us!!!!!
Then I get this email -- it makes sense to me: This makes more sense than
the "don't buy gas on a certain day" routine that was going around.
Gasoline Prices!  Whomever started this has a good point.  By now you're
probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap.  Me too!  As it
is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies and the OPEC
nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of gas is
CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response. With the
price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take
action.

The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we don't
buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have come to
rely on our cars.

But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together.

HERE'S THE IDEA:
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL.  If they are not selling,
they should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their
prices the other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to
reach literally millions of users.  But it's do-able!  I am sending this
note to
30
people.  If each of you send it to at least 10 more ...and those 10 send it
to at least 10 more, and so on by the time the message reaches the sixth
iteration we will have reached over one million consumers. Acting together
we can make a difference.  If this makes sense to you, please pass this
message
on, or one you compose, to at least 10 more E-mail addresses.

PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO $1.28 -$1.29 AND KEEP
THEM DOWN.  THIS CAN REALLY WORK.

Hope you all made it home in good shape.  All of us from Avista got back
pretty much on time.

Please accept our sincere thanks for hosting the three of us and our wives
this past week.  The Biltmore experience was truly unique and very much
appreciated by all of us.  The meals, rooms, and grounds were all
spectacular.  And then there was the SPA--my wife won't stop talking about
it!  She doesn't often travel with me, and certainly has never received that
kind of attention on any trip we've made together.

Thanks also for the golf; TPC is definitely the most noteworthy course I've
ever been on.  I have a lot of practicing to do before I go back.

All in all, it was great fun.  We were expecting it to be just that, but
once again you've exceeded our expectations.

Thanks,

February 22, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

Poets may be "the unacknowledged legislators of the world," as Percy
Bysshe Shelley once put it, but what of journalists? Well, in the
February and March issues of Harper's magazine Christopher Hitchens,
a columnist for The Nation and Vanity Fair and the author of a new
collection of essays on literature and politics entitled
*Unacknowledged Legislation*, has been making a bid of his own for
legislator -- or prosecutor -- status, arguing in his inimitable way
that Henry Kissinger ought to be indicted for crimes against humanity.

This week and next in Atlantic Unbound, James Fallows, The Atlantic's
national correspondent, engages Hitchens in an exchange of e-mail
correspondence about both the Harper's articles and the book -- with
its essays on such writers as George Orwell, Salman Rushdie, Norman
Podhoretz, and many others. To accompany the exchange, we're offering
two influential Atlantic articles by Seymour M. Hersh (a journalist
"legislator" if there ever was one) from May and December, 1982,
which went on to form part of his book *The Price of Power: Kissinger
in Nixon's White House*.

Also this week: a flashback to Charles C. Mann's report on the
Napster controversy from last September's Atlantic, new Unbound
Fiction, fresh ink from Sage Stossel, and more.

Cheers,

THE HEAVENLY JUKEBOX
In last September's Atlantic, Charles C. Mann argued that most
coverage of the Napster controversy has missed some basic points.
Chief among them: the fight against Internet "piracy" is being led by
a peculiar and grasping business -- the recording industry -- that
should not be allowed to set the rules.

"Waugh's Sword"
Readers respond to the review of Evelyn Waugh's *Sword of Honour*
trilogy in the February Atlantic. Was Waugh a razor-sharp satirist
and one of the great novelists of the 20th century, or was he prone
to "snobbery, prejudice, cowardice" and a "nauseating contempt, laced
with fear, for the lower classes"?

Hi Mary Jane,

I thought, since you have a cell phone, that you might want to participate
in this bargain. Pass it on to others and I'll bet we can get it even
cheeper.

Hope you day goes smoothly and pleasantly,
Michael

As many of you know, I am relocating myself and my family to Portland.  I 
have a found a new house (yeah!) but need to move my family up here before 
the house will be ready.  So,  I am looking for a house to sit or a furnished 
house or apartment to rent. Two bedrooms or larger.  We would occupy the 
abode through April 14.  I can begin the sit/rental immediately but no later 
than March 31.  

If you know of something, please come see me.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Hi,

Here is my update from our second leg.  Not quite as thorough as the first
one I'm afraid, but we're going to be saving our better writing for venues
other than the web site.  Pictures should go up on the site soon.

Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse

Update for Leg 2: Cora to Jackson

The Unbearable Lightness of Skiing

By Win Goodbody

Joe and I were in good spirits after the first leg.  It was a perfect opene=
r
to our winter in Greater Yellowstone.  Despite the brutal cold and a
marathon exit day, it was, on the whole, an enjoyable time.  Perhaps too
enjoyable.  After almost 5 days back in town mending gear, mind, and body,
we departed for our second leg in the Gros Ventre Range with a cavalier
attitude.  Though we had budgeted 10 or 12 days for this traverse, we now
thought it might take only a week.  But we were wrong.  Instead of a walk i=
n
the park, the Gros Ventres were a lesson in how slow and difficult progress
can be when the weather turns bad.   We were sternly reminded that in
adverse conditions, the mountains hold all the cards.

We traded sleds for packs on this 60 mile trip from Cora to Jackson.  It ha=
d
been a long time since I carried a full pack, and somehow I forgot there is
a world of difference between pulling and carrying weight.  Joe wisely
trimmed down as he set out what he was bringing.  Imagining more stellar
sunrises and sunsets ahead, I was determined to tote the same 20 pounds of
camera gear I had with me on the first leg.  Big mistake.

As we hefted our loads and pulled away from the car, I knew I was in
trouble.  My pack towered over Joe=01,s.  I could just barely lift it off t=
he
ground.  It looked like I was setting off for months.  In addition to
filling every cubic inch of interior space, I had so many items lashed to
the outside I felt like a backpacker=01,s version of the Joad family, who f=
led
the dustbowl with all worldly possessions hanging off their battered truck
in =01&The Grapes of Wrath=018.  I was to fare about as well on this trip a=
s the
poor Joads did in Steinbeck=01,s bitter novel.

Good weather persisted as we made our way up Rock Creek to the high crest
that runs continuously from just east of Bondurant all the way northwest
past Jackson to Slide Lake and the Gros Ventre River.  We had hard-packed
snow machine tracks to follow for the first two days.  On day 4, approachin=
g
the first pass by Hodges Peak, we got a taste of world class wind.  It is
not for no reason that Wyoming is a prime site for development of
wind-generated power, we learned.  Like the cold on the first leg, wind was
to be our constant companion on this trip.  It raged through the gap,
knocking over full water bottles left standing on the snow during a break.
Luckily the air temperature itself was mild or we would have been turned
into frozen statues.

After traversing around the west side of Doubletop Peak through worsening
visibility, we emerged into clear, calm air and a stunning sunset.  We had
not known ahead of time whether or not we could get through a gap between
two sets of cliff bands.  If we couldn=01,t, it was going to mean dropping =
a
few thousand feet into a steep drainage we would then have to climb back ou=
t
of a mile or so farther along.  But the gap went through easily, and we
turned the corner to find ourselves staring at a classic multi-tiered rock
shelf that stretched away for two miles toward our next pass.  The red glow
of evening coated sheer walls above as we made camp among giant boulders.

We were now solidly up on the Gros Ventre high route.  On the map, it was
amazing how little actual distance remained between us and Slide Lake, the
terminus of this section.  We had simply to cross a high basin, another
drainage, and then follow a high plateau to Sheep Mountain, from which it
was =01&all downhill=018.

The wind was blowing hard as we passed Palmer Peak the next day and set our
sights on the Crystal Creek drainage.  A little while later it was blowing
really hard.  We couldn=01,t tell whether the snow flying horizontally past=
 us
was falling from the sky or being stripped off the ground, but either way
visibility was poor.  We went nonstop for a few hours to get off the expose=
d
high basin where the Gros Ventre River originates.

Descending Crystal Creek we took our skins off and skied at a pleasant pace
through nice powder snow to the valley floor.  As we went lower and got out
of the wind, we could see that it was indeed snowing, and that there was
about a foot of new snow on the ground.  Whereas up high the wind kept much
snow from accumulating and sculpted what little coverage there was into a
rock hard surface, down here in the still, densely treed valley the snow wa=
s
deep and light.

That night we cheered ourselves by digging out a large shelter for our
floorless cooking tent.  The Megamid is a pyramid tent that sets up easily.
After digging a square pit several feet down, you erect the tent with one
center pole and have a large, warm area to sit in.  Sheltered from the wind=
,
we were very comfortable and drank cup after cup of tea and cocoa as we
consulted the map and assessed the route ahead.  We hoped to wake and find
blue skies.  Island in the Sky, the plateau that was to be our highway for
the remaining 5 or 6 miles before we descended toward Slide Lake was not fa=
r
away.

The storm wasn=01,t over the next day, but it had stalled a bit.  We moved =
down
the valley through deep snow and then started to climb up an adjacent fork.
Dense woods slowed us to near a standstill, but by nightfall we had reached
a spot where, at least in clear weather, we should have been able to see th=
e
final climb up onto the Island.  The storm was now back on track, and as we
got higher we could feel the first brushes of what was undoubtedly a
screaming wind up on the Island.  Again we excavated a deep pit for the
Megamid and passed a warm evening inside, wondering what the weather would
do tomorrow.

The next day, as was now becoming the pattern, the morning was almost clear=
.
  We got ourselves going and continued traversing up the side of Crystal
Creek=01,s West Fork headed for Island in the Sky.  As we passed over steep=
er
terrain, we noticed how fragile conditions had become with the additional
load of new snowfall.  Everywhere we went we heard the snow collapse, and
shooting cracks ran in all directions.  Sloughs moved on even the smallest
hillsides.  We sincerely hoped we would be able to find a route that did no=
t
cross any open slopes.

By afternoon, true to form, the storm was back in high gear.  Trailbreaking
was knee deep.  If film had been taken of us at this point, maybe replaying
it at fast forward speed would have looked like a normal pace.  The weight
of my pack was becoming painful.  My left leg had strange tingles running
down it and was slightly numb.  Joe said that happened to him sometimes whe=
n
he carried a heavy pack.  =01&Have you been carrying a heavy pack recently?=
=018 he
deadpanned.

Despite the storm, we could see the edge of the Island.  We were right at
the base of it, and only a few hundred feet of climbing would be necessary
to get on top.  We were now at the head of the West Fork drainage, and as w=
e
approached treeline, the wind increased.  Though it was only 2 pm, we
decided to camp and wait one more day to see if the storm would abate.  If
we were going to venture up high in these conditions, we wanted to start
first thing in the morning to have a full day to make our way across safely=
.
  For the third night in a row, we built a snug Megamid shelter.

I was awake most of that night listening to the wind and snow, sometimes
thinking it was easing.  But by morning the four day old storm was coming o=
n
strong.  It was day 8 of our trip.  We weren=01,t getting any breaks this t=
ime.
  Knowing it could in fact go on like this for days, we decided the sooner
we got up and over, the better.

Trailbreaking was difficult as we left the trees to negotiate a few small
cliff bands.  At one point Joe set off a little slough that moved him
downslope about 50 feet.  The terrain was such that we were in no real
danger, but conditions were flashing a bright red light at us.  We knew we
had no steep slopes to reckon with, so we continued on, hugging a scoured
ridgeline where grass poked through the snow.  Soon we were on top.

Island in the Sky is a featureless plateau that runs for three or four mile=
s
just south of Sheep Mountain and due east of Jackson Hole.  It is as high o=
r
higher than anything to the immediate west, and is thus exposed to the full
force of the prevailing wind.  As we shuffled onto this no man=01,s land, I
felt like a bug on a windshield.  The wind was shrieking.  Visibility was
almost zero and we were navigating by compass alone.  I found that looking
straight down at my skis was the best way to maintain balance, as otherwise
there was nothing to see but white and it was hard to tell whether you were
standing or falling.

We leaned into the wind with poles splayed out on either side.  Sharp gusts
or sudden pauses would precipitate frantic movements as we tried to readjus=
t
our stances.  We were in the thick of it.  I think we both realized the
seriousness of our position, though we didn=01,t talk about it.  Of course =
we
could always retreat and wait another day, but the desire to get out was
strong.  As we continued, four or five times, just when we really needed
some guidance, we caught brief glimpses through the clouds of a ridge or
valley far below.  These moments were enough to figure out where we were.
After two or three hours of feeling our way, we made it to the base of Shee=
p
Mountain.  Visibility was too low to see down the slope we thought we could
descend, so we set up our tent prepared for a windy night.

Waking up to clear skies in a place where you went to sleep unable to see
anything is an interesting feeling.  Down below was Jackson, and we were
eight miles from the road.  It all seemed so much simpler now that we could
see.  Of course we ended up making a wrong turn, and a six hour bushwhack
through enormous downfall and dense woods ensued.  Reminiscent of our last
exit, darkness saw us staggering onto a packed snow mobile trail.  A few
more miles and darned if those weren=01,t headlights coming toward us: a fr=
iend
picking us up, and just in time.  We really have to stop driving on those
trails.

Taking that weight off my back for the last time was a relief.  As blood
flowed and feeling returned, I resolved to never again overload myself that
way.  No more stuff hanging every which way off my phone booth-sized pack.
Never again.  I would be a Joad no more.

TransAtlantic | The Atlantic Online | http://www.theatlantic.com

April 12, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

"However much we think of poetry as a disciplined scatter of words on
white, or the proud aestheticism of the thin volume," Sven Birkerts
writes in Atlantic Unbound this week, "it remains, at root,
historically and performatively, a pneumatic event. Pneumatic, from
the Greek root pneuma, relating to wind or air, but inescapably
carrying overtones of 'spirit' and 'soul.'"

Poetry has been the soul of Atlantic Unbound from the start. In fact,
the very first Web-only feature produced for The Atlantic's site,
coinciding with its official launch on November 1, 1995, included
recordings of Robert Pinsky reading excerpts from his acclaimed
translation of Dante's *Inferno*, the sound of his voice streaming
over the Internet in RealAudio 1.0, or downloaded in 8-bit .AU files.
(See http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/aandc/dante/danthome.htm --
and don't worry, the audio quality has since been upgraded.)

Five months later, on April 1, 1996, we launched the Poetry Pages
(http://www.theatlantic.com/poetry/). Featured that month were Peter
Davison's introduction and readings of Robert Frost's poems from the
August, 1915, Atlantic, along with readings by Rodney Jones and
Stephen Sandy of their poems appearing in the April issue,
inaugurating our ever-growing Audible Anthology of Atlantic poems
read aloud by the authors. (The anthology now contains more than 200
recordings by 81 poets. See
http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/poetry/antholog/aaindx.htm)

This month, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Poetry Pages, we're
presenting three text-and-audio features: Frank Bidart, Peter
Davison, and Robert Pinsky read Robert Lowell's poem "For the Union
Dead" (originally published in The Atlantic for November 1960), with
an introduction by Davison; Christopher Ricks reads and comments on
T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"; and Sven
Birkerts reviews newly released recordings of Randall Jarrell, one of
the twentieth century's great poet-critics, reading his own poems
(you can hear Jarrell reading "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner"
and "The Woman at the Washington Zoo").

Read, listen, and enjoy.

Cheers,

Wen Stephenson

* A post-script to our longtime TransAtlantic readers:

This is my last collection of Web-only features commissioned and
edited as editorial director of The Atlantic Online, though I'm happy
to say that they are not the last poetry features I will edit for the
site. (I'm leaving the staff of The Atlantic next month, but I will
continue to edit the site's Poetry Pages.) I am profoundly grateful
for having had the opportunity to work on The Atlantic's online
edition for what is almost seven years now. And I am grateful most of
all to my Atlantic colleagues, past and present; to the many writers
who have lent their words and their voices to our cause; and to you
our readers, who have lent your eyes and ears. Best wishes to all. -WS

Due to popular demand, an Excel worksheet has been created in the famous 
Phonelist workbook (thanks Teri and Lisa!).  When you update the Cost Center 
list, the numbers on the Cost Distribution tab will automatically update.  
This further reinforces the importance of keeping that Cost Center list 
current.

If you have any other ideas or suggestions to add, all the better!

Thanks for your patience,

 I thought you would get a kick out of this speech that Larry Ellison (Oracle 
CEO) gave at Yale University to the Graduating class of 2000.
What follows is a transcript of the speech delivered by Ellison at Yale 
University last month:

 "Graduates of Yale University, I apologize if you have endured this type of 
prologue before, but I want you to do something for me. Please, take a good
 look around you.  Look at the classmate on your left. Look at  the classmate 
on your right.  Now, consider this: five years from now, 10  years from now,
even 30 thirty years from now, odds are the person on  your left is going to  
be a loser. The person on your right, meanwhile,  will also be a loser. And
you, in the middle?  What can you expect?  Loser. Loserhood. Loser Cum Laude. 
In fact, as I look out before me today, I don't see a thousand hopes
for a bright tomorrow. I don't see a thousand future leaders in a thousand 
industries. I see a thousand losers. 

You're upset. That's understandable.After all, how can I, Lawrence "Larry" 
Ellison, college dropout, have the audacity to spout such heresy to the 
graduating 
class of one of the nation's most prestigious institutions?  I'll tell you 
why. Because I, Lawrence "Larry" Ellison, second richest man on the planet, 
am a college 
dropout, and you are not. Because Bill Gates, richest man on the planet-for 
now anyway-is a college dropout, and you are not. Because Paul Allen, the 
third richest
 man on the planet, dropped out of college, and you did not. And for good 
measure, because Michael Dell, No. 9 on the list and moving up fast, is a
 college dropout, and you, yet again, are not. 

Hmm ... you're very upset. That's understandable. So let me stroke your egos 
for a moment by pointing out, quite sincerely, that your diplomas were not 
attained in vain. Most of you, I imagine, have spent four to five years here, 
and in many ways what you've learned and endured will  serve you well in the 
years ahead. You've established good work habits. You've established a 
network of people that will help you down the road. And you've established 
what will be lifelong relationships with the word "therapy."  All that of is 
good. For in truth, you will need that network. You will need those strong 
work habits. 
You will need that therapy.  You will need them because you didn't drop out, 
and so you will never be among the richest people in the world. Oh sure, you 
may, 
perhaps, work your  way up to #10 or #11, like Steve Ballmer. But then, I 
don't have to tell you who he really works for, do I? And for the record, he 
dropped 
out of grad school. Bit of a late bloomer. 

Finally,I realize that many of you, and hopefully by now most of you, are 
wondering, "Is there anything I can do? Is there any hope for me at all?" 
Actually, no.
It's too late. You've absorbed too much, think you know too much. You're not 
19 anymore. You have a built-in cap, and I'm not referring to the 
mortarboards on your heads.  

Hmm .. you're really very upset.  That's understandable. So perhaps this 
would be a good time to bring up the silver lining. Not for you, Class of 
'00. You are a 
write-off, so I'll let you slink off to your pathetic $200,000-a-year jobs, 
where your checks will be signed by former classmates who dropped out two 
years ago. 
Instead, I want to give hope to any underclassmen here today. I say to you, 
and I can't stress this enough: leave. Pack your things and your ideas and 
don't 
come back. Drop out. Start up. For I can tell you that a cap and  gown will 
keep you down just as surely as these security guards dragging me off this 
stage are keeping me dow..." 

(At this point The Oracle CEO was ushered off stage.)

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20

es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my
class was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked
like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone
bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd." I had
quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends
tomorrow (afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.

As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They
ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him
so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in
the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible
sadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over
to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear
in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks.
They really should get lives." He looked at me and said, Hey thanks!"
There was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real
gratitude. I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As
it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen
him before. He said he had gone to private school before now. I
would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We talked all
the way home, and I carried his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool
kid. I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with my
friends and me. He said yes. 

We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, 
and my friends thought the same of him. Monday morning came, and there 
was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said, 
"Boy, you are going to really build some serious muscles with this pile of 
books
everyday!" He just laughed and handed me half the books.

Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we
were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on
Georgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we
would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going
to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle 
was
valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He 
had
to prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having
to get up there and speak. Graduation day came, and I saw Kyle.
He looked great. He was one of those guys that really found him during
high school. He filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He
had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.

Boy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I could see
that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and
said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!" He looked at me with one of those
looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. "Thanks," he said.
As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began.
"Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through
those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings,
maybe a coach, but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you
that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her. I
am going to tell you a story."I just looked at my friend with
disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill
himself over the weekend.

He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do
it later and was carrying his entire stuff home. He looked hard at me and
gave me a little smile. "Thankfully, I was saved. My  friend saved me from
doing the unspeakable." I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this
handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I
saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not
until that moment did I realize its depth. 

Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture you can 
change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts us all in
each other's lives to impact one another in some way. Look for God
in others.

You now have two choices, you can:

(1) Pass this on to your friends or
(2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.

As you can see, I took choice number 1. "Friends are angels who
lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly." 
It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you really
care.

Eleanor Roosevelt wrote: "Many people will walk in and out of 
your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart."
To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your
heart. Anger is only one letter short of danger. If someone betrays you once, 
it is his fault; if he betrays you twice, it is your fault. Great minds 
discuss ideas;
Average minds discuss events; Small minds discuss people. He who loses money, 
loses much; He, who loses a friend, loses  much more; He, who loses faith, 
loses all.
Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old
people are works of art. Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live 
long enough to
make them all yourself. Friends, you and me.... you brought another
friend.... and then there were 3. We started our group.... our circle of
friends.... and like that circle.... there is no beginning or end. Yesterday 
is history... 
Tomorrow's a mystery. Today is a gift.

It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you
care. Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND. If
it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.

WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED
TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON 
WHO SENT IT TO YOU.

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830

Hello everyone,

Sometimes it is necessary to figure out how certain costs can be distributed 
evenly and fairly among our groups here at the Portland West Desk.  Below you 
will find an attachment that will automatically calculate the percentage 
breakdown for each group, after entering the total amount in the space 
provided.  The cell above "enter bill total here" is the sum of the column to 
its left.  It should equal the bill total.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
Anna

April 27, 2001

+ THIS WEEK ...

"I joined the baboon troop during my twenty-first year. I had never planned
to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead, I had always assumed I
would become a mountain gorilla." So begins Robert Sapolsky's new book, *A
Primate's Memoir,* about the time he spent in Kenya's Serengeti over the
past twenty years, researching the stress levels of a troop of baboons.
This week, we're featuring an interview with Sapolsky, a professor of
biology and neurology at Stanford. Sapolsky's interests are wide-ranging,
and our conversation with him covers everything from the shadows
colonialism still casts on Africa, to the fallacy of free will, to why he
only rates as a "pathetically low-ranking baboon." We've also included two
excerpts from *A Primate's Memoir,* so you can get a sense of Sapolsky's
witty and lively prose.

Best,

A SIGN OF THE TIMES
by Joan Wilking
Apr 25 | "He's wearing one of Mom's old bathrobes, a cotton kimono, one she
and Dad bought on a trip to Japan. He's barefoot. He's been barefoot and
wearing the same kimono since I moved back in eight days ago. You can
believe me. I'm keeping count."

LOOKING FOR LEB RED
by Velisarios Kattoulas
Apr 25 | "When I arrived at the University of London in the late 1980s, the
thing to take to parties was Leb Red--not a charming French table wine, but
a pungent, murky brown hashish from Lebanon's Beka'a Valley. Regrettably,
my fellow undergraduates majoring in Japanese were a bit square--several
have since entered finance--and by the time I fell in with the
anthropologists, Leb Red was nowhere to be found."

Interviews
ROBERT SAPOLSKY: OF MONKEYS AND MEN
by Katie Bacon
Apr 25 | "For these baboons, stress is entirely socially generated, so they
really are good models for us. Study some marginal baboon population in
some dying ecosystem and it would not be anywhere near relevant to making
sense of which middle-aged executive gets heart disease. Our stress is
created by our privileged cocooning from ecological stressors; likewise
these baboons." The author of *A Primate's Memoir* talks about his years as
a member of a troop of Serengeti baboons.

Just in case this is news to you, I've spoken with Ben Gwaltney (A/P) in 
Houston about processing rebates.  He explained that when applying for the 
rebate, have the rebate check payable to Enron.  Send the rebate check in on 
a Deposit Transmittal Form, and code it with the same codes you had used to 
process the initial expense (company #, expense code and cost center to which 
the rebate should be credited).  If a Deposit Transmittal Form is unavailable 
to you, you can just staple the check to a piece of paper showing the 
appropriate codes.  Mail this deposit form with the rebate check via 
inter-company mail to:  Treasury, Sam Round EB2703.

If I've left someone off of this message who would find this information 
helpful, please pass it on.

Have a good weekend! 
Anna

Anna, I would be happy to have my name as the contact for Kinkos, and I'm 
excited about benefiting from reduced pricing and better quality than 
provided by Sir Speedy.  I'm also very impressed by your initiative in 
contacting George Weber and making these arrangements for the Enron office.  
It is very much appreciated!

Hi Debra,

Would you agree to having your name as the contact person for this 
arrangement?  I certainly wouldn't mind if I were, but I thought it might be 
more appropriate if you were.  Also, if this goes through we could consider 
Kinko's for production jobs instead of Sir Speedy.

Let me know what you decide about our contact name.

Thanks,
Anna

Anna,
We have certain metropolitan areas set up with Kinko's  that get reduced 
pricing through the Enron agreement with Kinko's.   I do not see Portland in 
the listing that was compiled when the agreement was signed last year.  
Portland may have been added later -  I will check it out.

We can add Portland if it is not on the list.   All I need is your address 
and contact person with telephone number.

Dear George Weber,

I retrieved your e-mail address from the gss.enron.com Web site.  I am 
interested in learning more about Enron's pricing agreement with Kinko's.  
Does this agreement apply to offices outside of Houston (we-Enron North 
America-are located in Portland)?  I'm aware of the arrangement with BT 
Office Products, which we currently benefit from.   Also, are there any other 
pricing agreements we would be able to utilize from our office here?

Please reply via e-mail, or feel free to call me at 503.464.7698.

Thank you,

Anna Mehrer
Administrative Assistant II

As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased 
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships. 

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would 
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve 
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not 
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 

http://www.nba.com/blazers/schedule.html#CURRENT 

If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, contact Blazer 
Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person.

Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only "in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises." (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.

Crosscurrents
MAUS CULTURE
by Peter Swanson
Mar 29 | "It seems there's a movement afoot to class-up comic books -- both
adult comics, by moving them out of the ghetto of specialty stores and
sci-fi racks, and kids comics, by giving them a significant place in our
pop-culture canon. I do not doubt for a moment the artistic merits of many
of the books and writers in the comics field, adult or otherwise. What I
wonder about is this sudden bid for legitimacy. If some of these upstarts
find themselves lodged between the Styrons and the Tans on the big people
shelves, will they still talk to the superhero comics?" From DC and Marvel
to the latest wave of serious graphic novels, the comic book has come of
age. Peter Swanson surveys the scene, and waxes just a bit nostalgic.

A. L. KENNEDY: SPASMS OF GRACE
by Julia Livshin
Mar 29 | "There's no bloodlust. And even with a very good matador and a
very good bull, the nature of the thing is that it isn't seamless and it
can't be entirely graceful. There will be spasms of grace. It's a very odd,
ramshackle thing. There are all kinds of strange pauses and clumsy bits,
and patches of costume drama, and then patches of this very odd, sometimes
beautiful communication." A conversation with the Scottish novelist A. L.
Kennedy, whose new book, *On Bullfighting*, describes the "death,
transcendence, immortality, joy, pain, isolation and fear" that is the
Spanish corrida.

Unbound Fiction
POINTS OF INTEREST
by Robert Cohen
Mar 21 | "And then, I don't know, there was something about the way they
looked that made me think: remember this. The light, the bees humming in
the grass, the lazy inconsequential flow of the afternoon, and your
daughter, your irritable knock-kneed eight-and-a-half year old daughter,
who will never be just this way again, just this tanned and skinny and
unselfconscious, this careless, careless.... I didn't think about it after
that. It was all reflex."

KAREN ARMSTRONG: DIVINE RETICENCE
by Harvey Blume
Mar 21 | "When I first began the study of religion, I found it difficult to
get a handle on Buddhism. It didn't have any of the things I considered
essential to religion, like a supernatural God, a sense of sin, authority
figures, doctrines. But the more I got into religious studies, the more I
began to think that this approach, this reticence about the divine, had a
good deal to recommend it." Harvey Blume talks with the author of *Buddha*,
the biography of a world-historical figure about whom nothing is truly
known.

In Search of Lost Adventure: Issue 4
-------------------------------------

- The Gift of a Delay -
by Mitchell Stephens


My wife is cold. Why is that throwing me?

After all, we are soaking wet following a day of floating - in and out of
the raft - through the succession of class one, two and three rapids on
the Chagres River, the river that feeds the Panama Canal. We've been at it
for about six hours now. It's getting late. And the motorboat that was
supposed to meet us and whisk us back to the van never showed. So we're
paddling, though we know it's too far to paddle. Every once in a while one
of the guides tries to get the radio to work. And my wife, who gets a
chill at the mere thought of air-conditioning, is naturally,
understandably cold and uncomfortable, and a little worried to boot.

But her attitude is throwing me.

The explanation can be found, I suspect, in something my friend Jeff Scher
had said when I told him I was about to undertake this around-the-world
journey. "Try to view every delay," he suggested, "as a gift."

This seemed, initially, an odd notion. His example - a trip to
Philadelphia he and a friend took, during which a flat tire forced them to
behold a lovely little town - was interesting but not all that persuasive.
Still, I remembered what he said. And delays certainly came.

First, the battery on my Toyota gave out in the below-zero temperatures
just outside of Kansas City. I needed a jump, and the guy in a beat up
Towncar parked next to mine was kind enough to provide one. In return I
was asked to give a couple of his acquaintances a lift somewhere. A gift?
These were two guys from the Deep South who would then be taking a bus
into Kansas City before spending twenty-some hours on another bus to
Mississippi (all this in order to see their wives and children on
Christmas). I did take the opportunity to meet them as a gift.

Then, a half hour past Matamoras, Mexico, my daughter (who had joined me
for a stretch) and I learned at a customs check that we were missing the
necessary permits and had to go all the way back to the border. A gift? I
found myself trying to see it that way. And it is true that we ended up
spending the night in a fine hotel in Matamoras and strolling around the
nicest part of that town.

Twice on this trip I have been stuck in long lines of cars, trucks and
buses behind serious accidents on narrow mountain roads. The first time it
happened, south of Oaxaca in Mexico, I was delayed for around an hour and
a half. While I was waiting, I chatted with some of the gray-haired
members of a six-house-trailer caravan, spending three months traveling
around Mexico. The second time, north of San Jose in Costa Rica, the delay
was more like three hours and I fell into an intense conversation with two
Dutch fellows who were almost finished with seven- and five-week tours of
Central America.

I was getting good at this. Yes, my plans were messed up. No, I didn't
have a lot of extra time to waste, trying to drive from New Jersey to
Panama. But, remarkably, I could get stuck without feeling put out.

At the heart of this newfound enlightenment was a kind of patience (not an
easy thing for a New Yorker to muster) plus an openness to whatever the
fates held. Jeff's advice turned out to be another way of saying: Keep
smiling. Keep your eyes open. Remember that one plan, one schedule, is
often as good as another. I believe it is good advice.

In fact, I found myself wondering, somewhere along the road, about all the
gifts I had missed - because my 1989 Camry has been so reliable, because
the trip so far has gone relatively smoothly, because my life so far has
gone relatively smoothly.

Which is why I am having so much trouble out here on the river. I am deep
into my semi-spiritual, view-delay-as-gift mode. Do you see that white
hawk! Maybe we'll stop at an Indian village for help. My wife, meanwhile,
here only for a short visit and therefore not practiced in such reveries,
is shivering. She's had enough.

When a boat comes by, she practically forces the guides to flag it down
and pay the young men inside to take us back. Impatience, too, can
occasionally be a gift.

CHINA: A WORLD POWER AGAIN (August 1999)

"The United States-China relationship, so prone to cultural and historical
misinterpretation, could be among the most unstable great-power

more of Asia. However justified our positions may be, dealing with China
will require cool realpolitik and scholarly know-how, not self-righteous
hysteria."

Politics & Prose
HITLER'S WILLING BUSINESS PARTNERS
by Jack Beatty
Apr 4 | "You are IBM founder Thomas Watson, it is 1937, and you must know
that the census and other work your German branch has performed for the
Nazis has been used not just to count cars and cows but to identify Jews.
Perhaps you have even read the comment of a Nazi statistician that 'In
using statistics the government now has the road map to switch from
knowledge to deeds.' You have visited Germany; you were in Berlin in July,
1935, when Black Shirts rampaged through the streets smashing the windows
of Jewish stores. Now, in recognition of your services to the Third Reich,
Hitler wants to give you a medal. Will you accept it?" Jack Beatty on *IBM
and the Holocaust* -- a shocking account of Big Blue's dealings with Nazi
Germany -- and on what the critics have failed to grasp.

Corby's Table
PASTA WITH A PASSION
by Corby Kummer
Apr 4 | "Whether they'll admit it or not, critics and food people go to
certain favorite restaurants whenever they pass through a city. Not because
these are the most daring spots, or the places to be seen, but because the
diner knows he or she will eat wonderfully. It's like settling back into
home. Valentino, in Santa Monica, California, is one of those restaurants.
Now the owner, Piero Selvaggio, has written his own cookbook, together with
Karen Stabiner, and it's one of the few Italian cookbooks I plan to keep on
my shelf." Corby Kummer reviews *The Valentino Cookbook*, and offers
selections.

For anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true 
story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and 
totally worth the read: 

On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at 
a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband 
in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash 
the quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,"she told 
her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. 

As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already 
aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating 
figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob 
me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice 
gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She 
stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She 
hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was 
thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too 
obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a 
mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed 
with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned 
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, 
and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator 
didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about 
to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. 

Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor." Instinct told her to do what they 
told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and 
collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take 
my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. 

She heard one of the men say politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that 
floor you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who said it had a 
little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a 
belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. 

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. "When 
I told my friend here to hit the floor," said the average sized one, "I meant 
that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you 
to hit the floor, ma'am." He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious 
he was having a hard time not laughing. 

The woman thought: "My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself". She was 
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed 
her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving 
as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three 
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. 

When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to 
her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she 
might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. 
As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as 
they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled 
herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. 

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached 
to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: "Thanks for 
the best laugh we've had in years." It was signed; 

Eddie Murphy & Michael Jordan

One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my
class was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked
like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone
bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd." I had
quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends
tomorrow (afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.

As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They
ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him
so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in
the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible
sadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over
to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear
in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks.
They really should get lives." He looked at me and said, Hey thanks!"
There was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real
gratitude. I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As
it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen
him before. He said he had gone to private school before now. I
would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We talked all
the way home, and I carried his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool
kid. I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with my
friends and me. He said yes. 

We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, 
and my friends thought the same of him. Monday morning came, and there 
was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said, 
"Boy, you are going to really build some serious muscles with this pile of 
books
everyday!" He just laughed and handed me half the books.

Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we
were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on
Georgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we
would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going
to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle 
was
valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He 
had
to prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having
to get up there and speak. Graduation day came, and I saw Kyle.
He looked great. He was one of those guys that really found him during
high school. He filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He
had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.

Boy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I could see
that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and
said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!" He looked at me with one of those
looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. "Thanks," he said.
As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began.
"Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through
those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings,
maybe a coach, but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you
that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her. I
am going to tell you a story."I just looked at my friend with
disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill
himself over the weekend.

He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do
it later and was carrying his entire stuff home. He looked hard at me and
gave me a little smile. "Thankfully, I was saved. My  friend saved me from
doing the unspeakable." I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this
handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I
saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not
until that moment did I realize its depth. 

Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture you can 
change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts us all in
each other's lives to impact one another in some way. Look for God
in others.

You now have two choices, you can:

(1) Pass this on to your friends or
(2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.

As you can see, I took choice number 1. "Friends are angels who
lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly." 
It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you really
care.

Eleanor Roosevelt wrote: "Many people will walk in and out of 
your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart."

To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your
heart.

 Anger is only one letter short of danger. 

If someone betrays you once, it is his fault; if he betrays you twice, it is 
your fault. 

Great minds discuss ideas; Average minds discuss events; Small minds discuss 
people. 

He who loses money, loses much; He, who loses a friend, loses  much more; He, 
who loses faith, loses all.

Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old people are 
works of art. 

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them 
all yourself. 

Friends, you and me.... 
you brought another friend.... 
and then there were 3.
 We started our group.... 
our circle of friends.... 
and like that circle.... 
there is no beginning or end.
 Yesterday is history... 
Tomorrow's a mystery. 
Today is a gift.

It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you
care. Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND. If
it comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.

WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED
TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON 
WHO SENT IT TO YOU.

Yo sista,

Sorry I've been so MIA.  You know how it is: move to a new city, lack the
money to buy groceries or put roof over head let alone purchase a calling
card.  I am enjoying my internship and even starbucks (it's kind of fun!),
but I am DEAD broke and trying to figure out how to pay rent this month.  So
I guess nothing's new . . .

Outward Bound is nice.  The "office" is an old renovated house about six
blocks from my apartment, which is a godsend when it snows (which it did
today, a lot).  The people here are generally really mellow - I'm sure you
can imagine.  Lots of "bro!", "dude!" and "no worries!" like we're
Australian surfers or something.  I actually heard somebody call some slides
(as in picture slides) the "slidey-slides" the other day.  But they're all
super nice, and I have my own desk and phone and voice mail, so I feel
important.  Starbucks is pretty fucking funny (again, use your imagination).
Everyone I work with is tall, skinny, male, goateed, and painfully in the
closet.  And you should hear the crap that people order - they actually have
a CODE for "half-caf" now.  Idiots - do you even know what actual coffee
tastes like?

So I heard you're moving in with Molly and Amber.  That should be fun.
Honestly, Kate, I love it here, but I think I'll be back sooner than I
thought.  I'm starting to think I could be really happy in Portland.  But
you can't beat the weather in Denver - it's sunny practically everyday!  And
the guys here know how to buy pants that fit properly over their shoes.  You
have to visit!  Our apartment is big and we could go out with Monica and it
would be really fun!  My phone number, by the way, is (303) 777-7132.  So
call me if you ever get those free long distance thingies that cell phones
tend to get.  Okay, let me know the gossip in p-town.  Love, anna

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've
been swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just
flaky, so there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and
getting "pissed") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found
one for $118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to
purchase and use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little
spring break action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by
the end of March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me
know, and I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber
was in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get
ahold of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver,
but from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate

Skippy
They call him Skippy, Skippy, faster than lightning, 
No-one you see, is smarter than he, 
And we know Skippy, lives in a world full of wonder, 
Flying there-under, under the sea! 
Everyone loves the king of the sea, 
Ever so kind and gentle is he, 
Tricks he will do when children appear, 
And how they laugh when he's near!

For all of you who have been inquiring about my recent reduction in
glasses...
Here is the web link to the doctor I used:

 http://www.willvision.com/html/index.html

As most of you know, I heartily recommend these folks based on my
procedure, and my results so far.

But I would also heartily recommend that you do what Kacia and I did and
research all of the LASIK processes out there, and attend competing
seminars discussing them.  We went to the Casey Eye Institute and to Will
Vision.  After attending both seminars, our choice was clear, but it would
not necessarily be the same decision for everyone.

If you have any questions for me - feel free.  I'm still amazed by the
whole thing!

- Clark.

thing, but the statistics are interesting.

Worth your time. Best, Stocky



FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.

The holiday party is this Saturday!  Please take a minute to review these 
last-minute details, guaranteed to make our holiday party an exercise in 
efficient merriness.....

1. Remember to RSVP.  If you have not done so, please see Kathy Axford or 
Anna Mehrer TODAY.

2. Parking will be provided free of charge. Upon your arrival, tell the 
bellhop you are an Enron guest.  Should you choose to park in the structure 
across Pine Street from the hotel, take the ticket to the front desk for 
validation.

3. Responsible drinking is encouraged.   Complimentary towncar services will 
be provided by our friend Elaina at IMAX Trans.  Please contact her before 
Friday to make arrangements. She can be reached at 503-358-7214, or via

address in the e-mail, and Elaina will schedule accordingly.  And remember - 
everyone's in the same holiday boat with an ever-increasing list of gifts to 
get, so your gratuity to the driver is appreciated.

4. Embassy Suites is offering rooms to Enron employees at a special rate of 
$125+tax on Saturday night.  A  breakfast buffet is included (as are those 
little bottles of shampoo and shower caps!).  Please call 503-279-9000 for 
reservations, and be sure to ask for the holiday rate.

Robert Hicks and his seven-piece swing band will provide the musical stylings 
for the evening, so don't forget to bring your dancing shoes. And our very 
own Frank Vickers, auctioneer extraordinaire, will once again bring the house 
to its knees for charity. Amen!

Dear Kate,

Thank you for your interest in the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced 
International Studies Program. We would like to confirm that your inquiry has 
been received.

We hope that the information we have provided on our web site is helpful in 
giving you a good understanding of the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program 
and application process. In response to your request, we will be sending you 
the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program brochure and an application form. 
You can expect these materials within three weeks.

We are proud to be at the forefront of innovative technology -- giving you 
the option of submitting an electronic application via the Internet. This is 
just one of the ways we use technology at the Johns Hopkins University. 
You'll also see it in the classroom, in faculty research, and in student 
services, from how you register for classes to how you look for a job.

There are several benefits to the Web Application option:

*  Saves time, and it is faster than the mail

*  Generates cleanly formatted applications that are exact replicas of the 
paper applications

*  Secure, reliable, and convenient

The Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program Web Application System is a new 
convenient option for applicants with access to the Internet. You can create 
a private, free user account that you can use to work on the Johns Hopkins 
University SAIS Program application. Your user account is password protected 
and allows you to work on your application over multiple sessions using any 
computer with Internet access (Netscape/Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or 
higher recommended).

Our Web Application System provides high levels of privacy and security.

We authenticate users and encrypt all data transmissions, keeping 
applications safe. The application fee is identical to the paper application 
- you pay no additional charges for use of the system.

There is step-by-step guidance on completing applications. The full set of 
instructions is available on-line. A personalized checklist keeps track of 
important items and deadlines. And an application auditor double checks your 
application prior to submission to ensure all mandatory questions are 
answered.

Using the Web Application System is entirely optional. Candidates using the 
web application will not be given any preference or advantage over candidates 
not using the web application.

The Johns Hopkins University SAIS Program Web Application System is located 
at: http://apply.embark.com/grad/JHU/SAIS/. The web site is run by 
Embark.com, a web application systems company, on behalf of the Johns Hopkins 
University SAIS Program. Embark.com continuously monitors the web site (24 
hours a day, 7 days a week) to ensure reliability, and their staff are 
available to assist all users of the Johns Hopkins University SAIS Web 
Application System.

We encourage you to preview the Web Application System at any time and to use 
the system if it meets your needs. If you have any further questions about 
the Web Application System, please feel free to email Embark.com at 
MBAappmaster@Embark.com, or call their web support staff weekdays between 
8:00 AM and 5:00 PM (Pacific time) at 1-800-734-7627 (option 3).

Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we

The above web site offers some good advice in the form of a list of items
to have ready in the event of a major earthquake here in Portland.
 Drinking water, flashlights, and first aid kits are some of the bare
necessities.
I can tell you from experience that if or when an earthquake hits you will
be glad you took the time to  prepare some of these items.

rock on.

See, I knew it!  You always assume the worst when really the reasoning was
kind of flattering - he thinks so highly of you that he doesn't want you to
see him upset.  I think that's a valid excuse, I'm totally the same way.
The other night I bagged on Nathan's dinner party, which I really wanted to
go to, because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first
cocktail.  You know what that's like, to be working so hard that you don't
feel like yourself.  Anyway, I'm glad it all worked out!

Michelle and I went out with Monica, John, Amber, Marky and John's brother
Mark on Saturday night.  It was so insane.  First of all, I was already
exhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar, regardless
of my 8am shift at Starbucks the next morning.  Then when we went to
Nathan's bar, Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead, knocking the odd garbage can
over along the way.  So they got to the bar before me, and they found Nathan
because Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing, and Amber was
like "Are you Anna's boyfriend?".  Thanks.  He was really cool about it
though, even though I think it caught him off guard.  I had to explain to
him that I NEVER used the word boyfriend, but he said he was flattered so it
was cool.  We were such an odd group: Amber and Marky were dancing with no
equilibrium, Monica's boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained
mute, Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar
cousin.  I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again,
but yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant, and we had
wine and two courses and dessert.  It was so great!  And some of his friends
came and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the
whole time.  He is SO GREAT!!!!  I don't know how accurate of a description
I am giving you, but I have never been so happy with a boy before.  He is
funny and cute and he loves wine and food.  Anyway, that's my deal.  Oh, and
Dad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow, but he called from
the Grand Canyon (I'm so jealous) and said my car is a "beautiful" champagne
colored Corolla.  I'm a little worried, but he said it's like new so I'm
sure it'll be great.

I think that on your next payday, you should put a bid on priceline.com for
a ticket here.  We would have so much fun!  Or you could even go through
mom's travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance - she said it
was only about $200 if you do it that way.  Of course, the later you come,
the sunnier it will be.  Anyway, I REALLY want you to visit!  And Monica
does, too.

Okay, keep me updated on the Dave situation - he sounds like boyfriend
material.  You should call me soon! (303) 777-7132, in case you lost it.

Love, Anna

Subject: RE:



Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is
though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee!
Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to
watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply
to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....

I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say
anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me
blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then
rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to
hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend
and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand
the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not
fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the
verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with
Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then
Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it
home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very
successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take
one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30.
Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me
there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill,
Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very
complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer
with "us." I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up
some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move,
because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me
and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At
about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's
psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya
think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work
and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in
such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd
reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something
instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed
and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and
finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was
over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his
balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now.
(that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help
me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere
along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing
that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June
because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did
the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories
when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes,
actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so
if you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just
that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess
what - I have to go. I'll call you tonight!

Take care,
kate

That sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running
Man, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If
anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any
of
your clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If
you think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which
your
demeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he
is
the stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the
same habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating
instances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And
being a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you
had the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.

Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.
I'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out
with you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we
know
you'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out
here, though.  It's about 67 degrees right now and it's 9:00 in the morning
on a day in March.  I can't believe how happy this sun makes me!  You would
love it, too.

Okay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks
he's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.  A stiff margarita will make
this whole problem a lot more manageable, don't you think?  You should go
have one.  Love you!

Luego,
Anna

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've
basically forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy
stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals
so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if
that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he
asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as
a rule, but this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and
actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so
livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish
work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying
at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi
cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by
yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

+ THIS WEEK ...

Last week we asked, If poets are the "unacknowledged legislators of the
world," what of journalists, in particular one Christopher Hitchens? This
week, in the latest installment of Atlantic Unbound's Soundings series, we
bring you the genuine article -- i.e., poetry -- in three side-by-side
readings of Andrew Marvell's seventeenth-century seduction poem, "To His
Coy Mistress," introduced in a brief essay by Linda Gregerson. Many have no
doubt read this anthology warhorse in high school or college English
classes ("Had we but world enough and time/ This coyness, Lady, were no
crime..." and so on). But we're willing to wager that you've never heard it
quite like this. The readers are three noted poets -- Gregerson, J. D.
McClatchy, and Heather McHugh -- each of whom knows how to perform a poem.
And Gregerson's introduction is a rare treat: a deviously smart, witty,
sexy, and original close analysis that you don't need a Ph.D. in English
literature to understand and enjoy. Imagine. No, don't imagine; see (and
hear) for yourself.

Also this week: the conclusion of Christopher Hitchens's exchange with
James Fallows, new recipes on Corby's Table, a bit of economic analysis
from Sage Stossel, and more.

Cheers,

THE WORK OF WORDS [PART THREE]
Mar 1 |  "I am in the uncomfortable position," James Fallows writes to
Christopher Hitchens, "of holding a widely caricatured view, which I will
try to defend. Namely, that Clinton's actions in the past six weeks justify
a harsher view of him than his previous conduct did. The contrary case is,
'What took you so long?' In this analysis, Clinton is behaving no
differently now from the way he has over the past eight years. My case is:
the way Clinton behaved in his final weeks in office, above all with the
pardons, actually was different from his previous record." See Hitchens's
reply to Fallows in the concluding round of their exchange on writing,
politics, Henry Kissinger -- and Bill Clinton.

MARVELL'S "COY MISTRESS"
with Linda Gregerson, J. D. McClatchy, and Heather McHugh
Feb 26 | "Can this poem really be after what it purports to be after?"
Linda Gregerson asks in her introduction. "Can it, as a seduction poem, by
even the wildest stretch of imagination be designed to work? What kind of
woman would be successfully wooed like this?" Poets McClatchy and McHugh
join Gregerson as each gives voice to Andrew Marvell's "To His Coy
Mistress."

Corby's Table
ISRAEL ON A BUN
by Corby Kummer
Feb 28 | " 'Why can't a country with two and a half million Jewish mothers
have better food?' Henry Kissinger supposedly moaned while conducting
shuttle diplomacy in the 1970s. Even today Israel isn't known for the
quality or variety of its restaurants -- although Joan Nathan, an
indefatigable expert on Jewish food and the author of monumental and
authoritative books on the subject, says that things have changed
enormously since the days when she lived there, in the early 1970s." Corby
Kummer looks at Joan Nathan's new book, *The Foods of Israel Today*, and
offers his favorite selections.

Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse

Update for Leg 1: South Pass to Cora

By Win Goodbody

The weather gods must have been in a good mood.  Maybe they had a good New
Year=01,s party.  On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown
accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent, waiting for storm
after storm to subside.  If one of every two days was suitable for venturin=
g
outside, I considered it a bit of luck.  But this time was different.  In
the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing 18 consecutive days of good
weather for our 130 mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range.

The drive south toward Lander, WY revealed an alarming lack of snow, both i=
n
the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start.  This has not been a
good winter so far in the Yellowstone region, and we wondered what
conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers.  Luckily, with the final gain
in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass, enough
coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car.  We had day packs an=
d
70 pound sleds.

Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an
interesting way to ease into the trip.  Instead of driving right up to the
base of the mountains, we had to work a little bit to get there.  Even
though we were on open range with scattered trees, this was some of the
trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route.
Steep-sided drainages and mini-gorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise
mildly rolling terrain, requiring detours and delays.

For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape, moving toward
distant peaks that didn=01,t seem to be getting much closer.  The 10 or 12
inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten, and our movement was
half skiing, half snowshoeing.  Each step sank to the ground, and ski tips
snagged in exposed sage brush.  When we came upon a perfectly groomed but
empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail, we took advantage of it to
quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage, our entrance to the mountains.

We were by now settling into our routines: relearning winter camping skills=
,
dividing repetitive tasks, and adjusting to the cold.  With only about 11
hours of daylight, our schedule was remarkably busy.  It was a struggle to
get moving by 10 each morning even though we got up at 7.  Lunchtime arrive=
d
immediately.  Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time
to make camp.  After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a 12
hour sleep.  The days flew by, and we focused on putting miles beneath the
sleds while the good weather lasted, not knowing it would last indefinitely=
.
  We were comfortable, but every waking moment was occupied and there was n=
o
time for relaxing.  We seemed to be always on the move.

The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights, and about a
week into the range, when we were up above 10,000 feet nearly all the time,
we had our first taste of real cold.  It was the night we camped in the
Cirque of the Towers, and we were in our floorless cook tent.  We had
excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake.  Except
for the entranceway, all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow
surface, and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside.

After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change.  Then I knew
what it was.  Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling
across the floor like a poisonous gas.  You could feel it cool your face,
try to get inside your clothes, turn your water bottle into a frozen brick.
I imagined my candle snuffing out, refusing to burn at such an obscene
temperature.  I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky
of blazing stars.  The cheap gadget was maxed out.  It was at least =01)25 =
F.
The cold was like a deafening air raid siren.  There was no escaping it.

That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next 8
or 9 days.  In the evening before going to bed I would check the
thermometer.  All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom, too
scared to try for a run up toward the numbers.  It was the same each
morning.  The daily temperature swings were tremendous.  We would go from
=01)25 F (or lower) to 20 F in a matter of hours in the morning.  The warm
midday sun was always a relief, but it didn=01,t last.  Our joy at being ab=
le
to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be
wearing every layer of clothing we possessed.  In the evenings, as soon as
the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed.

Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or =
a
radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight.  It is truly an amazing natural
phenomenon to be reckoned with.  We marveled at it again and again, this
thing you cannot see or hear or smell.  It is both beautiful and horrifying=
,
an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory,
but with luck not on your toes or fingers.  It might be hard to explain why
it is a fascinating spectacle to behold, but there is no denying that it is=
.
  As the days went by, we became students of this strange, invisible force.
But of course we still got cold every day.

Our good weather continued, and we knocked off high pass after high pass on
our voyage north.  Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple
drainages.  For mid winter, we were really moving fast.  With so little sno=
w
on the ground, at least we were not delayed by having to worry about
avalanches.  Without consciously deciding to do so, we were in fact
traveling harder during the day, stopping later each night, and spending
less time readying a good camp.  More and more we were going flat out all
day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it
again.

Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what =
I
have come to know as a death march.  Though a death march typically occurs
at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g=
o
all day or all night without thinking of the consequences, a death march ca=
n
also occur at any time during a trip.  For example, if you discover you
haven=01,t brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e=
nd.
Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner
to reach a safe haven.  Probably the defining characteristic of a death
march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with.  But there
comes a point when, like an investigator, you step back for a minute,
examine the evidence of your daily life, and it suddenly dawns on you that =
a
death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it.  The horror!
The horror!

At the outset of the leg, we were putting in good days because we wanted to
get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin.  Once we were
there, we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted, to make
some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely
descend.  After we had been going about 10 days and did some math based on
the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead, we realized that we woul=
d
not have time to exit as we had originally planned.  In fact even after
cutting off some substantial passes and distance, it was still going to be
all we could do to make it out in the time allotted.  So we decided to put
in more good days.   We always had a reason for not resting, for going hard
day after day.  One night while thawing my foot out over the stove, I
realized we were not going to have a single rest day.  We were going for it=
.
  We had gotten sucked in.  We were on a death march.

The long days alone would have been manageable, but we had a growing proble=
m
that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night.  Our
sleeping bags were filling with ice, which impaired their ability to loft
and hence insulate us.  This is a common problem in extreme cold.  As you
sleep, you radiate moisture and heat.  The moisture passes through your
sleeping bag and escapes into the air.

When it is very cold, however, the temperature difference between the air
inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass
through the bag=01,s outer skin.  As moisture goes to move that last millim=
eter
from the comfortable 70 F temperature inside the bag to the outside air, it
gets walloped with a 100 degree temperature difference (let=01,s say it=01,=
s =01)30 F
out).  Instead of escaping, the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag=
=01,s
outer shell.  This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate
materials designed to impede the flow of moisture (usually rain) into the
bag from the outside.

This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night=01,=
s
moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag.  Unless the bag is
thawed out and dried, there is no solution, and you will reach a point wher=
e
all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping
on your insulated pad in your clothes.  We had already taken to wearing mos=
t
of our clothes inside our sleeping bags, and this just barely worked.
Still, more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately
huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th=
e
hideous cold of yet another clear night.

As light at the end of the tunnel appeared, our daytime efforts reached a
fever pitch.  Day 12, 8.5 miles.  Day 13, 9 miles.  Day 14, 7 miles.  Day
15, 9.5 miles.  And these were by no means easy flat miles.  They were
trailbreaking miles up and down passes, all above 10,000 feet.  Reaching th=
e
entrance to Titcomb Basin, we veered northwest toward the origin of the
Green River at Peak Lake.  Originally we had planned to go north from
Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain, the last peak above
13,000 feet in the Winds, before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork,
eventually reaching the Green River drainage.  But because of time, low
snow, and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down
the Green.

Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass, we caught a glimpse thousands of feet
down the Green River drainage.  The end was near but we were still looking
at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground, where we hoped
to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining 20 miles to our car in Cora.
The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is
shocking.  We silently gazed 10 miles down a classic, deeply carved, thickl=
y
forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls.  Toward their
northern end the Winds turn into a series of high, broad plateaus above
11,000 feet, and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down.
Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges, sheer cliffs, or
other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds.  As we had changed our
exit route, we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus.  But
even here getting down was going to take some doing.

Day 16 was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter
our minds: perhaps this was the day we would get out.  Eating pizza in
Jackson tonight?  Sleeping indoors, not encased in an ice tomb?  No more
holding frozen body parts over an open flame?  Perhaps.  We slowly suffered
up Vista Pass, where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about 8
miles and descends a neighboring creek.  I had got into the habit over the
last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was =01&really goin=
g to
be the last uphill=018.  Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo=
uld
round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead.  But I was undeterred by
past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that =01&this is it=
=018.
He said nothing.

Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail
for hours at a time, the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll
and the wheels were coming off.  I had no enthusiasm for leading.  I felt
like the walking dead and just wanted to follow, my eyes locked on a track
in front of me, legs trudging on automatic pilot.  But as I grew weaker, Jo=
e
became unstoppable.  He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final
days, and I was happy to let him. Especially going downhill though tricky,
steep sections he raced far ahead.  Perhaps it was a desire to escape my
singing that drove him forward.  I sang many pop songs, past and present,
but refused to sing Neil Diamond, Joe=01,s favorite artiste.  As this dispu=
ted
issue festered, Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the
two of us.

As it turns out, Vista Pass really was the last uphill, and now it was time
to go down.  After a few hours of easy traversing, we lost the trail and
decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders.
Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess.  Joe was in front, skiing
straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops.  He was
soon out of sight.  Following his track was a bit of an eye opener.  It fel=
t
like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around =
a
tree.  In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled, Joe was
sticking 4 and 5 foot drops.  I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac=
k
that went over the top of a boulder, then straight down for a few feet, the=
n
continued on.  I had more solid AT gear, but there was no way I was doing
that.  I was sure I=01,d break a ski.

Later, Joe confided that the way he=01,d been able to descend these boulder=
s
was to surf down sloughs of snow.  As he went over the tops of rocks, snow
would slide off and cushion his descent and landing.  But as the second guy
down the course, I enjoyed none of this extra padding.  It was all gone.
Instead of using the Hartney straightline method, I tried side stepping dow=
n
from the top of the boulder, turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line
that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed.

It didn=01,t work too well.  Shorn of most of their snow, the boulders, it
turned out, were covered with glare ice.  Again and again I would be just
about to take the final step down when my skis would slip.  I fell over my
skis downhill, face-planting in the stream bed.  The sled then crashed on
top of me.  I struggled to release skis and waist belts.  Once I had to get
out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly
juicy fall.  To make matters worse, I was getting wet from these repeated
snow baths.

Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that
where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull
there was a grave problem.  The connection points were tearing away from th=
e=20
body and threatened to come off altogether.  When and if that happened, I
would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle=
d
to my body.  I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might
do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my
stream run.

At last the track I was following left the creek, and I thrashed down into
dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack.  It
looked like he=01,d been there for quite a while.  I waited for some sign f=
rom
him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough.  Nothing.  I acted
nonchalant:  =01&That was fun.=018  =01&Yeah,=018 Joe said.  =01&I broke my=
 sled it looks
like,=018 I countered.  =01&Oh really?=018  Finally, I had to ask.  =01&Did=
 you fall at
all back there?=018  =01&What?=018  He was looking at the map.  =01&Oh, no.=
  I did have
to slow down at one point though.=018  Here I=01,d spent the last hour egg
beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis.  And Joe had
to slow down once.  The poor kid.

Needless to say, we didn=01,t make it out that day.  But we did make it to =
the
valley floor.  Flat ground at last!  Now I could claim that there would be
no more uphill or downhill.  But all was not yet goodness and light, and we
soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable.  Deepe=
r
than the snow we had battled through at South Pass, it exhibited the same
general characteristics.  Deeply rotten and unsupportable, yet dense and
heavy, it was nearly impossible to move through.  We were snowshoeing again=
,
pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the
surface, only to sink down a foot.  Pure hell.  Too spice up what promised
to be hours, and possibly days, of fun battling our way out, I decided to
make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River.  After
plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing
current, I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail
like a good boy.  My skins were now coated with ice which removed any
possibility of sliding on them.  Oh well.  That night we made a fire and fe=
d
it with prehistoric glee, which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my
boots.  But we still weren=01,t out.

Day 17.  Joe and I don=01,t need to verbalize this, but it=01,s just sort o=
f
understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today.
No chance of not getting out today.  Nope.  I mean zero chance.  We even ge=
t
up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may
throw at us (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors, etc.) we are still
making it out.  As I flee the ice bag, I notice it=01,s only =01)10 F down =
here in
the sultry valley.

Even though he broke trail most of yesterday, Joe is out in front again.
The snow is worse than ever.  Somehow even with a trail to follow I can=01,=
t
really keep up.  I occupy myself with bitter, frivolous =01&Well, at least
we=01,re not getting attacked by a moose=018 kind of thoughts.  I look arou=
nd for
some small forest creature to curse at.  Anything to divert attention from
the pain in my feet and legs.  Damn pikas.  Bloody chipmunks.  But there=01=
,s
nothing about.  Staggering along, I feel almost like a third party to our
plight, like I=01,m watching it on tv.  Tra la la.  This is pretty fun, I l=
ie
to myself.

But our suffering pays off.  We come upon a lake.  Could this be Green Rive=
r
Lakes?  We consult the map.  Surely there must be some mistake.  I wait for
Joe to inform me that we=01,ve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe=
rn
British Columbia, hundreds of miles from the nearest road.  But no.  As if =
a
ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet, the lake lies
there like a highway.  Trumpets are sounding.  Angels are fluttering above
motioning us forward.  Not only will trail breaking be easier, we now have
certifiable proof that we are only 4 miles from Green River Lakes
campground, a snowmobiling mecca.  It=01,s only about 1 pm and clear and su=
nny.
  Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this, even if i=
t
is a Tuesday.  We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive
female snowmachiners, all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride
back to Cora, 20 miles distant.  We=01,ll probably need flak jackets.

We pick up the pace.  Or rather Joe picks up the pace.  Apparently he think=
s
he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake, because he=01,s going down the lake like a rock=
et.
He=01,s not even going in a straight line.  He=01,s swerving all over the p=
lace,
going like a madman for the finish line.  He doesn=01,t care because WE ARE
GETTING OUT TODAY!  One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a
straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake, so I regai=
n
some time.  We cross the first lake.  There are ski tracks in the snow.
Humans!  At the second lake, where the wilderness boundary ends, I am about
as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place.
But strangely, ominously, no machines.

At 3 pm we are at the campground.  Snowmobile tracks everywhere.  It=01,s j=
ust
a matter of time, I tell myself.  They=01,ll be here.  We reach the far end=
 of
the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear
rearranging, readying ourselves for that magic ride.  We scatter things all
over the road, effectively blockading it.  Nobody is getting by here withou=
t
picking us up.  The sun is still shining and it=01,s downright warm.  As a
little joke, I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the
drying process which, I imagine, will really kick into gear in about three
hours when we=01,re back in Joe=01,s living room in Jackson and have turned=
 up the
thermostat to about 85 F.  Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this.
I mean, it=01,s not like we=01,re going to need the thing tonight.

Total silence.  Wonder where they are, these =01+bilers?  Must be a local
tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or
something.  We start getting a little upset.  Almost indignant.  Don=01,t t=
hese
people know how to have fun?  Where are they?  A day this beautiful and
noone=01,s out on their machines?  Where is everyone, off cross country ski=
ing
or something?  Sun=01,s going down now.  For god=01,s sake WHERE ARE THEY?!

And then, just as faint as the sound of a mosquito, we hear it.  A little
buzz.  Was that the wind?  No, I still hear it.  Could it be a =01( plane?
Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzzzzzzz.  No sound could be more soothing, more friendly,
more welcome at that moment than this: the sound of not one but several two
stroke engines heading our way.

We finally crack.  Screams, high fives, arms raised.  Hysteria, release.  W=
e
knew it!  We knew we=01,d make it out tonight!  Victory is ours!  We are go=
ing
to live!  After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and
set about repacking the crap I=01,ve strewn all over the road we=01,ll look=
 a
little more appealing.  A little more like someone these gracious, heroic,
good-natured =01+bilers will want to pick up.  I lower my arms, wipe the te=
ars
off my face, and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack.

We start cleaning up.  In an instant we are already mentally back in
Jackson.  Back in town.  Back indoors.  As if transported by a futuristic
machine, we are no longer at a remote trailhead 20 miles away from a town o=
f
maybe 200 people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming.  We are home.  We are
warm.  We are about to have dinner.  Joe=01,s in the shower.  I=01,m checki=
ng my
email.  Beam me up, Scotty.

For some reason the =01+bilers (there are 4 of them) have stopped almost a =
mile
short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines.  Now
that doesn=01,t look good.  The sun has just gone behind a peak, and in abo=
ut
15 minutes the temperature will go into freefall.  We can=01,t imagine why
anyone would come the 20 miles out here and not go all the way to the lake,
which is on the other side of us.  They=01,re probably playing a game of
rock-paper-scissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the
ride back, but we are sure not taking any chances.  Maybe they just haven=
=01,t
seen us.  Before I can suggest that he=01,d probably enjoy some brisk skiin=
g
after such a slack 17 days, Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating
down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with,
uh, you know, the pickup and the ride back and everything.

I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic
meeting.  I=01,m sure that as soon as he gets the aok I=01,ll be hearing a =
lot of
noise from Joe.  I imagine the bilers=01, responses:  =01&You skied 130 mil=
es from
where?  Good lord, son, you get on the back of this machine and we=01,re go=
ing
back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now.  Here, I=01,ll ju=
st
call ahead and get that in the works.=018  =01&Now wait just a minute there=
, Bill.
  Who said we=01,re going to your place?  We=01,re having it at my house.=
=018
=01&Jimmy, over my dead body.  We=01,re going to my house and we=01,re havi=
ng a
dinner and dance, and then we=01,re taking them to Vegas for a week.  And i=
f
anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense, there=01,s going =
to
be a fight.  It=01,s all on me.=018  =01&Sorry, Bobby, but it=01,s just not=
 going to be
like that at all.  We=01,re going to my place, we=01,re eating for two days=
, and
then I=01,m taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for=
 a
week.  And I=01,ll be damned if my two daughters aren=01,t coming with us.=
=018  I
start to get a warm fuzzy feeling.  These are my people!  I=01,m determined=
 to
try snowmobiling as soon as possible.  Maybe even convert.  Screw this
skiing stuff.  I want horsepower!  I start singing as I pack up my sled.

The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and
set off headed toward me.  But Joe remains standing in place like a fence
post.  He=01,s not moving at all.  I figure he=01,s just so bowled over by =
all the
outlandish offers of hospitality we=01,ve received that he=01,s wondering h=
ow
we=01,re going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week.  What
with all the parades, barbecues, snowmobiling with the mayor, square dances=
,
and motivational talks at the high school, we may have to push back the nex=
t
leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days.  Here come the
=01+bilers.  Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine.  This does not
look good.

I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade.
Well, they may be getting to the lake, I think, but they can=01,t get out. =
 The
most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me, and only one
even waves.  No eye contact at all.  That=01,s alright, I think.  Out of
consideration for us they=01,re hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp=
se
of the lake and then they=01,re going to zip back and get us.  We=01,ll tal=
k back
at their place.  They just don=01,t want us to spend a single additional mi=
nute
outside.  How kind of them.  That=01,s why they didn=01,t stop.

Then it hits me.  The music stops, the needle goes screeching across the
record.  We=01,re in trouble here.  Something is terribly, terribly wrong.
This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with
their extended family should be acting.  Joe is moving now at least.  He ha=
s
taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed.  I
shout to him, =01&Well?=018  No response.  =01&Joe?=018  =01&JOE!=018  I re=
peatedly shout at
him as he approaches within 100 yards.  He=01,s not answering.  God this lo=
oks
bad!  I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson
watching tv to Defcon 5.  I=01,ve been yanked out of the shower and I=01,m =
at the
North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not
coming and we have to make the 1400 mile trek home by dogsled.  And we don=
=01,t
have any sled dogs so we=01,ll be using marmots instead.  It=01,s pretty cl=
ear we
are not getting a ride back with the boys.

Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives.  The party consisted
of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan.  The guide mumbled some
bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a
ride.  Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized
the guy was serious.  He did not want to help us, who knows why.  This
outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat
there at first.  It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara
Desert.  =01&Sorry, I=01,d love to pick you up, but you might put your feet=
 on the
dash and smudge the leather.=018  Would any skier coming across a broken do=
wn
snowmobiler 20 miles from the road refuse to help, refuse to lend a hand in
any way?  We couldn=01,t fathom this.  Where was the back country fellowshi=
p,
the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyoming=01,s
wildness?  Sorry.  It wasn=01,t there this time.  We were crushed.

The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood, now
hateful, bubble-headed practitioners of an idiotic, environmentally damagin=
g
sport, came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs.  I stared at them
menacingly.  They did not stop.  Good thing for them.  We spent 20 minutes
on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print, and then we got out ou=
r
pathetic list of options.  We had already gone about 10 miles that day.  I
don=01,t know about Joe, but after 17 straight days of going for it, I was =
a
mess.  It was 4:00 pm.  Another 20 miles separated us from the car and
salvation.  We could either camp and continue in the morning, or keep going
a little further until dark.  Or, of course, we could commit to the grand
finale death march.

We decided on the death march.  We would eat dinner, pack it up, and go
until we got to the car.  Just another 20 miles.  It wouldn=01,t be so bad.=
  A
rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a 30 mile da=
y
(and night), but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser.  From step
1, I knew it was a mistake for me, but Joe definitely had the fire for
getting out.  We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and
rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight.  Every step hurt.  Every minute =
I
wanted to stop.  I lasted about an hour before seriously considering
stopping for the night.  Another key characteristic of the death march is
that one person wants to do it and the other really doesn=01,t but just goe=
s
along with it.  It was clear who was in which role.  This was sort of a new
experience for me, for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to
keep going.  Not this time.  I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he
heard I wanted to stop.

For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words, =01&I think we sh=
ould
stop.=018  But I held on.  Just another step.  Take another step and see ho=
w it
felt.  It felt bad.  My feet were on fire.  My legs were slightly numb down
the sides.  I was hobbling.  I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody=
=20
Allen.  But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress.
We did not recognize the route, could not assess how much farther, had no
landmarks.  It could be another hour or another 10.  I had myself convinced
we could ski four miles an hour.  By that math, we should be able to reach
Cora in time for last call.  Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o=
f
torch-bearing villagers to go hunt down the four =01+bilers who were guilty=
 of
crimes against humanity and must pay!

Darkness.  Temperature down to a cheery =01)10 F.  Real heat wave here in t=
he
shadow of the Wind River Range.  It=01,s another clear, windless night on t=
he
range as we slowly, painfully make our way out of the mountains.  The ice
hard road crunches under our skis.  Dead silence otherwise.  At last, the
pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me, an=
d
2=20
 hours into the death march, even though I have convinced myself we must
be half way, I mouth the words.  I=01,m not asking, I=01,m telling.  As sel=
fish as
that may be, I can=01,t go on.  I know Joe is severely displeased, but he
agrees silently, and we stop to set up the tent.  In 10 minutes we are
huddling in the ice bags, praying for warmth.

Looking back, I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou=
r
sleeping bags considering the state they were in.  Usually the bag is a saf=
e
house, a place to go when all else goes wrong, a place to retreat to.  But
in our case it was the opposite.  Because the weather was so perfect, the
days were our sanctuary, the place we could recover from our torment in the
bags and get warm again.  Had it not been for the perfect weather, we could
not have lasted.  But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our
sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day.

Until they were of no use whatsoever.  Inside the tent, we are both
thrashing around in our bags fully clothed.  I put on my down jacket inside
the bag for the first time.  Luckily we both have down pants which we have
been wearing to sleep for more than a week.  The bags are doing more harm
than good at this point, but we don=01,t really get that.  The thought does=
n=01,t
occur to us to try sleeping without the bags.  It=01,s obvious that neither=
 one
of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep.  For the first time
on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night.  I can survive, but it i=
s
not going to be comfortable.  Maybe we=01,d be better off going for the car=
.  I
can=01,t face that unknown quantity.  Another 2=20
 hours?  More?  I realize we
are looking at a sleepless night: 9 hours of waiting for the sun to come
back around.

After an hour Joe announces he can=01,t sleep and wants to keep going.  He=
=01,s
wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag.  We talk about it and decide
he will go for the car and I will stay the night, continuing at first light=
.
  The thought of getting out of the bag, cold as it is, putting on frozen
boots, hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get
physically ill, but Joe still has something left.  He departs at 9 pm, back
out into the cold, clear Wyoming night.

I drift in and out of sleep.  I actually do attain some warmth, but somehow
I am also getting wet.  Must have slipped off my pad.  Don=01,t care.  I am
cramped and crippled, a few limbs need blood, but rolling over acts like a
huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have, so I lie still.  My watch says
3 am when I check it.  Only another few hours and I'll be on my way.  I eve=
n
consider getting up right then and continuing but don=01,t.  I think of Joe=
 and
the brutal death march he must have faced, or might still be facing.  Hope
he makes it.  I drift off again.

4:30 am.  I hear a noise.  Sounds like an engine.  It=01,s not a snowmobile=
.
Not high-pitched enough.  Sounds like=01( a car!  In the space of one minut=
e I
go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag.  I know exactly
what=01,s happened, and I am ecstatic.  It=01,s Joe!  He has driven the car=
 back
down the snowmobile trail to get me!  Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i=
s
thundering over the hill, flags all around.  No time is spent wondering
exactly how Joe got the car here.  Before he has it turned around I am out
of the tent and furiously packing my sled.

We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes.  I slip
under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I
feel the heat blast from inside.  Joe=01,s had the heater on high for hours=
.
We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut.  The
contrast is too stark.  It can=01,t be real.  I keep waiting to wake up in
northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as
coffins.  But I am awake, and we are homeward bound at last.

Joe happily relates his tale like he=01,s telling me who won the Super Bowl=
,
and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams.  He left the
tent to resume the death march at 9 pm.  We figured we were half way, so he
was looking at another two or three hours at most.  More than five hours
after leaving the tent, close to 2:30 am, Joe reached the car.  It started.
Just the thought of going that long, not knowing whether it might have been
another five hours, is too much for me to consider.  Suddenly all my past
death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country
with birds chirping in comparison with Joe=01,s saga.

After starting the car, Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking
up on junk food and coffee, then returned to the trailhead.  At Green River
Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on.
Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail, Joe eased his
Ford Escort up onto the trail.  The car didn=01,t sink in at all.  He kept
going and was soon whizzing down the trail.  =01&So how far was it from the
tent to the car?  Did you measure?=018 I asked.  =01&12 miles.=018

With the heater on full and early morning of our 18th day starting to show
itself in the rosy eastern sky, we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs=
,
bacon, and pancakes.  We had gotten away with murder and we knew it.  Never
in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather.  We had
done nothing to deserve it.  But with this unprecedented window thrown open
to us, we had breached the Wind River Range=01,s defenses and squeaked thro=
ugh.
  In January.

Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along.  I=01,ve got some
things to learn from this guy.

> >>> > > > > > Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door.

> >>> > > > > > It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the
> >>> > > > > > highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
> >>> > > > > > clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along.
> >>> > > > > > Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying

> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a
> >>> > > > > > 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at
> >>> > > > > > a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of
> >>> > > > > > him.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > "How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > "Fifty cents," replied the waitress.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and
> >>> > > > > > studied the coins in it. "Well, how much is a plain
> >>> > > > > > dish of ice cream?" he inquired.
> >>> > > > > > By now more people were waiting for a table and the
> >>> > > > > > waitress was growing impatient. "Thirty-five cents,"
> >>> > > > > > she brusquely replied."
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > The little boy again counted his coins. "I'll have
> >>> > > > > > the plain ice cream," he said. The waitress brought
> >>> > > > > > the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked
> >>> > > > > > away.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and
> >>> > > > > > left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as
> >>> > > > > > she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside
> >>> > > > > > the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies -
> >>> > > > > > You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had
> >>> > > > > > to have enough left to leave her a tip.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > 4 - Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a
> >>> > > > > > roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if
> >>> > > > > > anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's
> >>> > > > > > wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply
> >>> > > > > > walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not
> >>> > > > > > keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about
> >>> > > > > > getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came
> >>> > > > > > along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching
> >>> > > > > > the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and
> >>> > > > > > tried to move the stone to the side of the road.
> >>> > > > > > After much pushing and straining, he finally
> >>> > > > > > succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of
> >>> > > > > > vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road
> >>> > > > > > where the boulder had been. The purse contained many
> >>> > > > > > gold coins and a note from the king indicating that
> >>> > > > > > the gold was for the person who removed the boulder
> >>> > > > > > from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us
> >>> > > > > > never understand.
> >>> > > > > > Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our
> >>> > > > > > condition.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > 5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a
> >>> > > > > > hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who
> >>> > > > > > was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her
> >>> > > > > > only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood
> >>> > > > > > transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had
> >>> > > > > > miraculously survived the same disease and had
> >>> > > > > > developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.
> >>> > > > > > The doctor explained the situation to her little
> >>> > > > > > brother, and asked the little boy if he would be
> >>> > > > > > willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him
> >>> > > > > > hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath
> >>> > > > > > and saying, "Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."
> >>> > > > > > As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to
> >>> > > > > > his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the
> >>> > > > > > color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew
> >>> > > > > > pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor
> >>> > > > > > and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start to
> >>> > > > > > die right away?"
> >>> > > > > > Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the
> >>> > > > > > doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his
> >>> > > > > > sister all of his blood in order to save her. You see,
> >>> > > > > > after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > Now you have 2 choices....
> >>> > > > > >
> >>> > > > > > 1. Delete this email, or 2. Forward it to people you
> >>> > > > > > care about. I hope that you will choose No. 2 and
> >>> > > > > > remember..... "Work like you don't need the money,
> >>> > > > > > love like you've never been hurt and dance like you do
> >>> > > > > > when nobody's watching."

Please take a gift card from the tree in the lobby and help us give our 
adopted family a very happy holiday!   I noticed some of the cards did not 
say sizes.  The mother wears size 10 in clothes and 6 1/2 in shoes.  Kassi 
wears a size 10 in girls' clothes and size 2 1/2 in shoes.  Josh wears a size 
10 in boys' clothes and a size 2 1/2 in shoes.
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                              
Also - Please raid your kitchen for extra cans of food or other 
non-perishable items.  If we each bring in three items, our family will be 
well fed this holiday season!  

This is also a great way to teach your children about giving.  Let them help 
with the shopping, or even donate part of their allowance to the cause.  

Thanks for your help in making this holiday season bright for people who are 
less fortunate than ourselves.

If you have questions about gifts, let me know.  Thanks.  Teri Whitcomb X

I just signed this very important petition to the President and
Congress urging them NOT to allow drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, our most magnificent wildlife sanctuary.  Drilling would
cause great harm to this wilderness area which is one of the few truly
wild places remaining.

Please go to http://www.savearcticrefuge.org,
add your name and pass it on!!!

Or you can add your name by checking out a great cartoon animation at

I thought this was important information for you to have. 


RAPE   -   Self Protection 


Hi, girls!  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense class, 
sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really valuable info with 
you before it goes out of my head. 

The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year 
in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one night after work 
and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  He started a women's group and 
began teaching these classes soon after.  This guy is a black belt in karate 
and trains twice a year with Steven Segall.  He and the others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look 
for and here's some interesting facts: 

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  They are most 
likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle 
that can easily be grabbed.  They are also likely to go after a woman with 
long hair.  Women with short hair are not common targets. 

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for a woman who's 
clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit they look for is overalls 
because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls 
the straps can be easily cut. 

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse 
or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can 
be easily overpowered. 

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the 
early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. 

The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store 
parking lots.  Number two is office parking lots/garages. 
Number three is public restrooms. 

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and 
quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about 
getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 
3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. 

If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it 
only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't 
worth it because it will be time-consuming.  These men said they will not 
pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used 
from a distance, in their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have 
to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. 

So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.  Several defense 
mechanisms he taught us are: 

? If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or 
with you in an  elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a 
question,  like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe 
it is  so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their 
face and could identify them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target. 

? If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you 
and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man talked to said 
they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be 
afraid to fight back.  Again, they are looking for an EASY target. 

? If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it 
and carries it with him wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and 
holding it out will be a deterrent. 

? If someone grabs you, you can't beat him with strength but you can 
by outsmarting him.  If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist back so your 
hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and twist it toward 
yourself and pull your arm away.  It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that 
are moving in that way.  They stumble toward you and you stumble back, so 
you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your 
knuckles in the forehead, nose or teeth. 

? If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker 
either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner 
thigh.  HARD.  One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the 
underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she 
broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed 
stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand 
it.  It hurts. 

? After the initial hit, always go for the groin.  I know from a 
particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's   balls (sorry 
to be graphic) it is extremely painful.  You might think that you'll piss 
the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists 
told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of 
trouble.  Start causing trouble and he's out of there. 

? When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers 
and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on 
them as possible.   The instructor did it to me without using much pressure 
and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly. 


Of course, the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of your 
surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd 
behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts.  You may feel a little 
silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble. 

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that could save 
her life.

Hey again!
Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

Kate,

If you would you, please start to draft a letter to the vendors for the 
solicitation of the raffle gifts?  We will probably need two letters, one to 
thank the vendor for their participation last year (I have the list of 
donated items) and another for new vendors that we will be soliciting.  

Here are a few points we need to make:

Thanks for particpating last year
Name the charity(s), a worthy cause type thing
State they are a current vendor in our system
The vendor name will be announced at the party, good advertising
Attach the article from last year

There may be more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Since we will 
be using the merge feature we can insert the name of the vendor in the body 
of the letter.

Thanks!

Mollie

Hey Mom!
Just wanted to give you my new email address!  Job is going well, I'll tell
you all about it when I have more time.  Also, new address is 515 Clarkson
#207, Denver 80218.  I'll let you know when I get my phone.  Apartment is
funky but big, good price, neat location.  Can you give me Kate's email
address?  Can't seem to find it.  Anyway, let me know when you get this so I
know it's working.  Hope all's well in Portland.  It has been gorgeously
sunny everyday here - snow on saturday!!  Also, I have a couple interviews
(one with Starbucks - whatever, it pays the bills!).  But if you can
possibly contribute to the something-for-me-to-sleep-on fund I would
appreciate it so much, as I am moving into my apartment on Monday and will
be bedless until my first paycheck.  Okay, tell everyone I said hi and that
I wish you were all here!  Love, Anna
