Whether you're investing for your kids' education or your retirement, the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach. The $1.35-trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas, from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes.

Many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years.
But to help you take advantage of all possible provisions, we should start
planning soon. Some of the ways you may benefit include:

Lower income tax rates. The gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun. In fact, the new withholding schedule went into effect on July 1.
And, you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10% bottom rate retroactive to January 1, 2001. As tax rates fall over the
next few years, your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals.

Education-funding incentives. Parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier. The tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as:

? Education IRAs - The accounts' contribution limit will rise from $500 to
$2,000 in 2002. What's more, money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses.

? State sponsored 529 college savings plans - Also beginning in 2002,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free. Currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary's rate upon withdrawal. 529s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits.

? Deductions for education expenses - The act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses.

? The Child Tax Credit - Though not tied specifically to education expenses,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college.
Previously $500 per qualifying child under 17, the credit increases to $600
in 2001-2004, $700 in 2005-2008, $800 in 2009 and $1,000 in 2010 and
thereafter.

Higher retirement plan contribution limits. The tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and IRAs - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably. Your options may include:

? Traditional and Roth IRAs - Annual contribution limits for both of these
types of IRAs will gradually rise from $2,000 this year to $5,000 in 2008.
After that, the limits will be indexed to inflation in $500 increments.

? 401(k)s and 403(b)s - Working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan. The limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $10,500 this year to $15,000 in 2006, and this doesn't
include the catch-up contribution provision for people 50 years and older.

And much more. There are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family. When we meet, we'll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them.

As you can see, the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas. But because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year-by-year changes.

Such planning is where American Express Financial Advisors excels. I'm
backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation, investments, estate
and retirement planning, and more to help you make the most of your
finances.

Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you.

This is a statement that was read over the PA system at the football game
at Roane County High School, Kingston, Tennessee by school Principal Jody
McLoud, on September 1, 2000. I thought it was worth sharing with the
world, and hope you will forward it to all your friends. It clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong  direction.

"It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games
to say a prayer and play the National Anthem to honor God and Country.

Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of Federal Case Law.

As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle, and if
someone is offended, that's OK.

I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe  sex. If someone is offended, that's OK.

I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control. If someone is offended, no
problem.

I can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to  religiously worship and praise the goddess, mother earth,
and call it ecology.

I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong, traditional Christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment.

However, if anyone uses this facility to honor God and ask Him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship, Federal Case Law is
violated.

This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical.
Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except God and
His Commandments.

Nevertheless, as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression.

For this reason, I shall, "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," and
refrain from  praying at this time. However, if you feel inspired to honor,
praise and thank God, and ask Him in the name of Jesus to bless this event,
please feel free to do so. As far as I know, that's not against the law-
yet."

AND...one by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands
with one another, and began to pray. They prayed in the stands. They prayed
in the team huddles. They prayed at the concession stand. And they prayed
in the announcer's box. The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme
Court of the United States of America - the seat of "justice" in the one
nation under God.

Somehow, Kingston, Tennessee, remembered what so many have forgotten... we
are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM Religion.

Praise God that His remnant remains!

Let's Celebrate Jesus in 2001

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my
Father."

---------

If you are not ashamed, Pass this on . . . but only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God. He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without
him, I am nothing but with Him, I can do all things through Christ that
strengthens me. Phil 4:13

What do you think about creating and maintaining an e mail address that will
automatically send an e mail to everyone in our class?  That way anyone that
wanted to blanket the class could always do so without going through you all
the time.

Did you survive bid week?
 
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left?
 
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
 
Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big changes. It sucks.? ?Later,?Ken? ?

Hi,
 
The number is 281-370-7838.
 
I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance  ones own, doesn't one. Of course the major problem was the people with HPL, not  the counter-parties. Who's doing that for you guys?
 
Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed  around. Saw Pearl Harbor, watched a few DVD's, and ate way to much.
 
When you get time let us know about your "bad luck". I hope  Jake wasn't helping you too much.
 
I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound  system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha  stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only  word to apply. I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (It's  a young couple with a baby) (Not near as nice as the other young couple I  know).
Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good.  :)
 
Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries  and taxes we'll be OK.
 
I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin, environment ruining, SUV  washed and buffed. Then I must re-stock my CD-R's and load up on some more  music. You can see how well I'm utilizing my time in doing productive  things.
 
Later,
Ken
 
P. S. I thought WAHA was where all the pillaging of California  was taking place.

Well, this season we lost Mick and O'Neal and picked up Daren and Plove. I guess I'll be on the court more to utilize my quickness since we lost a couple of guards.  We have a buy next week to open the season.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

	There is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we've all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks, but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could've been, I guess there
are a lot of people who were saved. . .




			Subject: The odds are against them

			By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
			destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US.
These were deplorable
			acts
			that we will never forget. But now is a time to look
at the other side of
			the
			numbers coming out of New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania. The sad
			but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
			  - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about
the attacks.

			*** The Buildings ***

			* The World Trade Center -
			The twin towers of the World Trade Center were
places of employment for
			some
			50,000 people. With the missing list of just over
5,000 people, that means
			90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A
90% on a test is an 'A'.

			* The Pentagon -
			Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the Pentagon.
			The latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives. That is an amazing
			99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to
have come in too low,
			too early to affect a large portion of the building.
On top of that, the
			section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
			that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist
attacks. It had
			recently
			completed straightening and blastproofing, saving
untold lives. This attack
			was sad, but a statistical failure.

			*** The Planes ***

			* American Airlines Flight 77
			This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the Pentagon could have
			carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard.
Luckily 78% of the seats
			were empty.

			* American Airlines Flight 11
			This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard, but only carried
			92.
			Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.

			* United Airlines Flight 175
			Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
			board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.

			* United Airlines Flight 93
			This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet. The smallest
			flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
			84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
			thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark, saving
			untold numbers of lives in the process.

			*** In Summary ***
			Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly
targeted by these inept
			cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's
a higher survival rate
			than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney
transplants and liver transplants
			- all common, survivable illnesses.

			The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon
was hit at it's
			strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people
in the World Trade
			Center buildings escaped, and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
			sacrifice to save even more lives.

			Pass this information on to those in fear and the
media. Don't fear these
			terrorists. The odds are against them.

Amy Brock

If you don't have Powerpoint installed, go to
http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Ppview97.aspx and download the
PowerPoint viewer.

Then you should be able to view the link at
http://my.servepics.com/pictures/attack.pps.

Again, if you are squeemish...don't bother looking at the slides.  It shows
people falling from the WTC.

Good God ---- where do you find time for all of that. You  should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have  many many stories.
 
By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by  some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better  than anything on TV.
 
You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible  pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will  run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.
 
I'll let you be for now, but do keep those stories coming ----  we love them.
 
Ken

 Subject: Please read, sign, and pass on.

THOUGH SHE'S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED, AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY
CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE.
GET THIS:

CBS will be forced to discontinue "Touched by an Angel" for using the word
God in every program. Madeline Murray O'Hare, an atheist, successfully
managed to eliminate the use of Bible reading from public schools a few
years ago. Now her organization has been granted a  Federal Hearing on the
same subject by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington,
DC. Their petition, Number 2493,  would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our Lord and Savior, and the airwaves of America.

They got 287,000 signatures to back their stand! If this attempt is
successful, all Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped. This group is also campaigning to remove all
Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools!! You as a
Christian can help!

We are praying for at least 1 million signatures. This would defeat their
effort and how that there are many Christians alive, well and concerned
about our country. As christians we must unite on this.

Please don't take this lightly. We ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation.

Please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard.
Together we
can make a  difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the Lord.

Please press "forward", CLEAN UP THE MESSAGE, and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this.

Now, please sign your name at the bottom (you can only add your name after
you have pressed the "Forward").

Don't delete any other names, just go to the next number and type your name.
Please do not sign jointly, such as Mr. & Mrs. Each person should sign
his/her own name.

Please e-mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this, and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion.

Dave,
Guess I had some misinformation on the type.  Per Yvette, the platelets or cells in Darren Farmer's blood were the match and the blood type was secondary.  I'm not sure how it works, but Darren is definitely the guy.  I have a call in to Lisa to clarify this.

Hi Dave,

Thanks for offering to talk to Darren about Lisa & Christopher.  Lisa can be reached at home at 281-296-0788 or cell 713-443-4523.  I'm sure she can fill in the details on how to have the blood credited to her account.

Anyone else you know of who has B- blood and would like to give would be MUCH appreciated!

Kris

Hey--Just thought I'd let you know that Lacy went to school this morning-pale & not feeling well--stomach still hurts, but she went ahead.  She's stressing me out big time.  She acted like she couldn't hardly move, but I came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone.  But I ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead.  I don't know about her.  But she looked pale.  Blood sugar was a little low this morning.  I woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good. So I got a little more rest.  I don't think she even woke up enough to remember it.  I don't think the little job is good for her if she's gonna catch everything they have.  She's so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails.  Not good!  Anyway, I'm stressed big time over her & over her driving the car. And missing so much school.  I wasn't going to take her to the dr. yesterday because she was better so I figured it was a virus, b!
ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she's gonna have to make up school on Saturday & they've threatened to fine me. So I had to pay $30 for them to tell me that she had a virus & missed a day of work.  Oh, well, life is fun.  Anyway, I need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there's so many with worse problems to face. I am thankful that the burdens are so light.  But you can still pray for us.  And encourage Lacy to work at Splash Town! Ha!
Remind me to tell you about the terroristic  threat at High School.  Another high stress time!  Can't wait until this weekend to see all my cousins & ya'll.  Kiss my grandsons for me.  Love ya

Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?  By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.  I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.

It's that time again.

Please put together a list of accomplishments for the first six months.

I know you can use the system some how, just not sure how.

Let me know.

Dear Christian friends,
Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus!
We have two very urgent prayer requests. Our dear friend and a brother, Dav=
id Gatewood, the son of late Otis Gatewood, has been recently diagnosed a p=
ancreas cancer. David and his wife Sandy were two of the first people who i=
ntroduced Dragica and me to Christ and His Church over thirty years ago. In=
 1969 they came to Croatia (Yugoslavia at that time), as missionaries, with=
 another couple, Bud and Beverly Pickl. In order to get their resident visa=
s, they enrolled in a Croatian language study program. I was their professo=
r at that time, and we became very good and close friends. David and Sandy =
have been connected with the Lord?s work in Croatia for all these years. Be=
fore leaving Croatia in 1972, they adopted a little Croatian girl, whom the=
y raised with much love. She is a married woman now, and lives in Colorado =
Springs. David and Sandy made several trips to Croatia during the war, and =
David taught seminars on post-war traumatic experiences and the value of a =
family. Your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in Croatia who lov=
e David dearly.
Also, please, put me (Mladen) on your prayer list. For several months now I=
?ve been having some prostate problems. Ten days ago my doctor requested a =
biopsy, and I am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming Monday. D=
ragica and I believe God listens and hears  prayers of His people.
Please, join the Church in Croatia with your prayers.
Yours in His love and mercy,
Malden and Dragica Jovanovic

Subject: FW: A&M and ESPN 
For Immediate Release 
June 26, 2001 
ESPN TO LAUNCH SIDELINES NETWORK'S SECOND REALITY-BASED SERIES TO 
PREMIERE WITH TEXAS A&M FOOTBALL 
ESPN will launch a 13-episode, prime-time series this fall entitled 
Sidelines, the network's second reality-based title under the ESPN 
Original 
Entertainment  (EOE) banner.  Sidelines will document the season of a 
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible, 
less 
celebrated people who are involved with the team.  The football Aggies 
of 
Texas A&M will be the focus of the series' premiere episodes to begin 
October 5. 
"Coach Slocum and I made the decision to be a part of this exciting 
venture 
with ESPN," Texas A&M Athletics Director Wally Groff said.  "We couldn't 
be 
more thrilled that ESPN has chosen Texas A&M for this series.  The 
opportunity ESPN gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all 
of 
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up." 
In a "docu-drama" style, the various stories that surround the team will 
be 
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day-to-day lives 
are 
directly affected by living in the town and/or going to the school. 
Players 
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral 
fashion, but will not be the primary focus. 
"This is a good opportunity for Texas A&M University and we're delighted 
ESPN decided to feature the football program and some of the people 
behind 
the scenes," Head Coach R.C. Slocum said. "We look forward to working 
with 
them." 
The participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who 
reflect 
every aspect of the University and College Station, Texas.  They will be 
students, faculty, media, local storeowners, mothers, fathers and some 
of 
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the University. 
"Each person has a role to play with the team, as well as a personal 
story," 
said Mark Shapiro, vice president and general manager, ESPN Original 
Entertainment.  "Sidelines will see each person grow in character as the 
season progresses -- a kind of 'soap-umentary.' We'll weave the smaller 
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression 
and 
fate of the team and its season." 
SIDELINES: TEXAS A&M STORYLINES 
--This is the 125th anniversary of the school's founding (1876). 
--The community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire 
collapse 
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago.  A 90-year 
tradition came to a tumultuous end.  Dealing with the loss and the 
emotional 
toll it took on faculty members, students and families will be an 
important 
part of this series.  The bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a 
different form than has been tradition. 
--Texas A&M, who lost a wild, snowy Independence Bowl last year in 
overtime 
to Mississippi State 43-41, will play Notre Dame (at home), Texas, 
Oklahoma, 
Kansas St and Colorado next year.  A tough schedule will provide for 
great 
drama. 
--The school invented the phrase "12th Man" and actually owns the 
trademark. 
One game, the Aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and 
stand 
ready just in case he was needed. Ever since, a student is chosen for 
every 
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team. 
--Billy Pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities. He's been at 
the 
University for 36 years and was the student trainer for Bear Bryant's 
A&M 
team. He was actually in Junction, Texas for Bryant's infamous grueling 
summer camp. The story of it was a best-selling book, The Junction Boys. 
--At midnight on the Friday night before every home game, A&M students 
gather at the stadium for what is called "Midnight Yell Practice;" 
30,000 
fans show up each week for this time-honored tradition. 
EOE, the newest franchise of ESPN Programming, will develop a 
wide-variety 
of branded programming outside of the network's traditional event and 
sports 
news genres. Using a collection of vehicles -- game shows, documentaries 
or 
reality-based shows - it's ESPN's goal to broaden its audience by 
appealing 
to younger and casual sports fans.  In addition, the company is 
exploring 
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all 
platforms of the ESPN family - television, Internet, radio

Daren,
 
Now what? I see Ken is back and Jeff is  out. What a development. Jeff has a lot of his bud's in high places. Could be  many changes on the horizon.
 
How you doing? Moved to new building yet?  I'll be looking for my tour invitation.
 
How's the kids, wife, and home (read that  work project)?
 
Jen is home for a couple of weeks before  heading back to Waco. We are going up there to tour the new Law school (built  with tobacco settlement money -- so we feel like contributators). She has four  quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go.
 
Son still in Florida. We plan to run over  there in September for a few days. Maybe do Disneyworld.
 
Jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the  Nebraska game in Waco this year. That should be fun. Speaking of football, I see  one Texas team high in the polls. The other???????
 
I got a new toy the other day. Sears had  a good sale on a power washer I've had my eye on, so I bought it. Just did the  patio and deck. God, I thought painting was mindless  work.....................
Also, found out from insurance company  they will be funding an entirely new roof (hail damage???). I don't like the  mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles I  will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof.   
 
Know you are busy. Let me know the latest  when you have time.
 
Later,
Ken

A friend of mine that I've known since college at Harding is looking for a
job in IT or consulting.

His last stint was as a Senior Systems Engineer in Compaq's SAP Solutions
Center.

He's a stellar guy, and very smart, as you can tell from his resume.

If you know of any opportunities, please pass this along.

Thanks,

Please respond to Hi Bubba!

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed".
Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw

I have felt a renewed heart for God, a fresh spirit.   I have been in the word lately and Doug and I have to committed to prayer time  together each morning.  It has brought a more positive attitude, much joy,  and thankfulness on my part.  And, yes, satan has already tried to steal  that joy.  But he will not prevail, I will not let Him.  So in those  times when I feel that any bit of joy is seeping away, I begin to pray.  I  found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well.  Please read it,  it may just jumpstart your day and you'll be filled with joy.  Have a  great day!  Amber
Please  take a moment to relax your mind and
humble your heart to focus on  Christ.
Allow God, to be the only person on your
mind while you read  this prayer. If we can
take the time to read long jokes, stories,  etc.,
we should give the same respect to this prayer.
Friends that pray  together, stay together.
Let's pray...
 Father  God,
I thank You for this day. I thank You for my
being able to see  and to hear
this morning. I'm blessed because You are a
forgiving God  and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me
and You keep on  blessing me.
Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
said or  thought that was not
pleasing to you. I ask now for Your  forgiveness.
Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.
Help me to  start this day
with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let
me make  the best of each
and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear
from  You.
Please broaden my mind that I can accept all
things. Let me not  whine and
whimper over things I have no control over. Let
me continue to  see sin
through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin,  let me
repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing,
and receive the  forgiveness
of God.
And when this world closes in on me, let  me
remember Jesus' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to  pray. It's
the best response when I'm
pushed beyond my limits. I know  that when I can't
pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to  do
Your will.?Continue to bless me that I may
be a blessing to  others.
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me
uplifted  that I may have
words of encouragement for others. I pray for
those that  are lost and can't
find their way.
 I pray for those that are  misjudged and
misunderstood. I pray for those who
don't know You  intimately. I pray for those that
will delete this without
sharing it  with others. I pray for those that
don't believe. But I thank
you that I  believe.
I believe that God changes people and God changes
things. I  pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each
and every  family member in their households.
I pray for peace, love and joy in  their homes
that they are out of debt and all their needs are  met.
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there
is no  problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.
Every battle is  in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that
these words  be received into the hearts of every eye that sees
them and every  mouth that confesses them willingly.
This is my prayer.
In  Jesus' Name, Amen.
If you prayed this prayer, change the number  in the subject
box before forwarding the message so people can  SEE how
many people have done so.

Start Your Own FREE Email List at http://www.listbot.com/links/joinlb
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Folks,

You've probably already read that listbot is dying as of August 6.

So, I've created a transition list on another service. To send messages to
the list, please start using the following e-mail address:

	brcc.yf@topica.com

I plan on closing the old list (bammelyoundfamilies@listbot.com) as of
Friday, August 13.

If you are still interested in participating in the "Bammel Young Families"
list, please send an e-mail to "brcc.yf-subscribe@topica.com".

If you think you'll want to check the past messages, or to create your own
lists in the future, use the following steps:

1. Go to http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

2. On the right hand side of the page, type in your e-mail address under
"Not a Topica Member yet"

3. Click "Continue"

4. Fill in the registration, then click the "I agree" button

5. You'll next see a page with text like "Thanks, Ram! You're almost done."

6. Scroll to the end of this page, and click the "continue" button.

7. A dialog will pop-up, asking whether you want to "tap into exclusive...
blah, blah, blah". Just click Cancel.

Once you join the new list, please drop me an e-mail to
"rtackett@abacustech.net". I'll then delete you from the old so that you
won't get duplicate messages from both lists.

The messages on the new list will be available to members online at:

	http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

One nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on "Vacation
Hold", so that we don't end up with auto-responder problems. For more info
on "vacation hold", go to http://topica.com/# and then click on the
"vacation hold" link under "subscriber services".


Thanks,

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

I'll now be including Gayla on these e-mails because she has agreed to
write
brief profiles of each new family for the bulletin.

Here are the First Friends candidates from this week (please remember to
tell me what assignments you made so I can track that with my new member
data - Thanks!)

Jeanna Bent

(Champion Oaks)

Michael and Jeanna are both CPA's.  They have a 7-year-old son named
Mason.
Michael's company will be relocating to New Hamphsire in the fall, but he
does not want to move, so he will be looking for a new job soon.  Michael
was just baptized two weeks ago after studying with Gerald Bendele.  He
was
raised in a Catholic background.  I believe Jeanna has been a Christian
for
some time.


Sandra Caballero

Humble, TX  77338
281-540-2331

Don & Sandra are transferring membership from Hidden Valley C of C.
Prior
to that they attended Katy for several years.  Don works at Compaq and
Sandra is at Clark Electric and Spring ISD.  They have a 16 year old son
named Daniel at Spring H.S. and an 18 year old daughter named Amanda at
North Harris Community College.

Vickie Gonsoulin
15718 Falling Creek
Houston, TX  77068

Vickie and Bill are transferring from the Magnolia church.  They have a
son
named Dustin who is a junior in high school.  He participated with
Bammel's
LTC program even before they placed membership here.  They also have an
older, married son.  Bill grew up in this area.  In fact, Ron Anders was
his
football coach.

Subject:	Survivor 2


A major network is planning the show "Survivor 2" this winter. In
response,
Texas is planning "Survivor: Texas Style." The contestants will
start in  Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio, over to
Houston,
and down to Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio, on to El Paso,
then to Midland/Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo. From there, they proceed to
Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.
Each will be driving a pink Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads, "I'm
gay,    I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."
The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Please click on the link below.

Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

I believe the boat is 18 to 19 ft long and I do have a boat cover.  I will bring the boat information with me tomorrow for anymore questions.  I recently took it to the shop to get it ready for this season and the salesman said it looked brand new.  It has a brand new battery and everything runs perfectly.  Call me if you want to take a look at it.

Damn!!!! What are you guys doing down  there. I leave you alone and the place goes to hell in a  hand-basket.
 
I'm sure glad my portfolio is diversified  into stocks that have lost even more money than Enron (chuckle).
 
Hang in there ......... this has happened  before. If it gets bad enough call me and I'll buy you lunch.

P.S. I finally get to see my beloved  Huskers in Waco this year. It is not the same as Mecca (Lincoln), but it'll do.  Besides we will have more red there than Baylor  green.

AP-College Station Texas----
Texas A&M football practice was delayed on Monday for nearly two  hours at Kyle Field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room  happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery  substance on the practice field. 
Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the FBI was  called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined  that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.  
Practice was resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not  be likely to encounter the substance again.

Subject:	Tribute to America

 I needed to read this in light of yesterday's events.....

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
 This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.
 Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
 recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
 Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
 Commentator. What follows is the full text of his
 trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional
 Record:


 "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
 Americans as the most generous and possibly the
 least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany,
 Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy
 were lifted out of the debris of war by the
 Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
 forgave other billions in debts.

 None of these countries is today paying even the
 interest on its remaining debts to the United
 States. When France was in danger of collapsing in
 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and
 their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
 streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

 When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
 United States that hurries in to help. This spring,
 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
 Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman
 Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
 countries. Now newspapers in those countries are
 writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.

 I'd like to see just one of those countries that is
 gloating over the erosion of the United States
 dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
 country in the world have a plane to equal the
 Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
 Douglas DC10?

 If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the
 International lines except Russia fly American
 Planes? Why does no other land on earth even
 consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You
 talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
 You talk about German technocracy, and you get
 automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,
 and you find men on the moon - not once, but several
 times - and safely home again.

 You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
 theirs right in the store window for everybody to
 look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
 and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most
 of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
 getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to
 spend here.

 When the railways of France, Germany and India were
 breaking down through age, it was the Americans who
 rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the
 New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an
 old caboose. Both are still broke.

 I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced
 to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name
 me even one time when someone else raced to the
 Americans in trouble? I don't think there was
 outside help even during the San Francisco
 earthquake.


 Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
 Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
 kicked around. They will come out of this thing
 with their flag high. And when they do, they are
 entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
 gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada
 is not one of those."

 Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!

***************************************************************
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever
 read regarding the United States. It is nice that
 one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of
 the world would realize it. We are always blamed for
 everything, and never even get a thank you for the
 things we do.

 I would hope that each of you would send this to as
 many people as you can and emphasize that they
 should send it to as many of their friends until
 this letter is sent to every person on the web. I am
 just a single American that has read this, TRIBUTE TO
 THE UNITED STATES

Ho ho ho, we're around to that most  wonderful time of the year---NEON leaders retreat time!
 
I know that  this time of year is extremely  hectic, and that it's tough to think about anything past the holidays, but life  does go on past the week of December 25 through January 1, and that's what I'd  like you to think about for a minute.
 
On the calender that I handed out at the beginning  of the fall semester, the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January  5-6.  But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are  connected with that week, we're going to change the date to the following  weekend, January 12-13.  Now comes the part you need to think  about.
 
I think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.
 
The first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.
 
The second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.
 
Email me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)
 
Have a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!
 
Bobby

Thoughts on Texas A&M...
Fox Sports Show Host Jim Rome

1)   They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army,and
red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite UT.
2)   Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from
where they get that I don't  now......the fact is, the State intended A&M
to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation.  Like Danny Devito in "Twins".
3)   So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good.
All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they
won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how
they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is
the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in
everything A&M does.
4)   The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at
A&M.
There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp.  East Texas'
answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now,
forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades
enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps
looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field
in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that
have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they
just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against
another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a
little actual sodomy.  Not only could I go on with more instances of
idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you
have your own stories.
The point is:
We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however,
nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act
like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect
these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians, move to Israel.
5)   It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national
television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be
against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked
down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have
moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's
Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board.
Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique
counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give
them a veil.
6)   "t.u." is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if
folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be
funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it.
Please learn.
7)   You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of
sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall
down.Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit
whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing
how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for
Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form
asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3", Weight
185.  Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East
Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade
education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base.
This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid.
8)   Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder,
they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability.
 The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about
marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college?
9)   Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now.
10)  Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly.
11)  Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that
it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there.That
should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any
better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
"Dukes of Hazard" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to
Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open
minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool.

As my friend Stephen Johnson once said: "If the world were ever to get an
enema, College Station is where you would connect the hose." If you go to
school at A&M, please don't be an Aggie.
God Bless the Great State of Texas.

Daren,

I contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday.
However, I know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
is extremely slim.  I hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family.  We'll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting (and so Sally can sing to
you).

We are so looking forward to seeing you, Tonya, Cole and Jake next weekend.
We're disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early.  We will certainly enjoy our visit with them.

Thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to Tonya that you
are.  It gives Sally and me such joy seeing Tonya highly honored and loved
by you.  You are a wonderful father too and it's so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons.  They watch your every move and hang on
your every word.  We're so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family, for being such an outstanding provider for their every need,
and for putting up with the "outlaws".  In addition to our friendship, I
love you as my own son.  Again, happy birthday.


David

Our CEO was contacted by a David Gardner, president of Gardner Energy in
Houston regarding a five-year package of gas.  I spoke to him only briefly
but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal.  Do you know of this
firm?  I was unable to pull up anything on the internet.  I suspect he's
just a marketer.

Don't spend any time on this.  I was just curious as to whether or not you
know of him or his firm.  Thanks.

Send me a request of who you want, and I will make the transaction this
evening...expecting that no one ahead of you in the waiver ranking makes a
bid for the same person.  The new player will be available for this weekend
(assuming the games are on!), and you will be dropped to the bottom of the
waiver ranking system.  Remember, you can only pick up 2 per week.  Get back
to me when you want!

Subject: "Red, White and Blue Out" 
Subject: The OSU game and Aggie Spirit 
This just in Ags!  If you are going to the OSU game on Sept 22, a Red, White 
& Blue Out is being planned, just like the Maroon Out games for the OSU 
game. 
Ags, What better statement can we Aggies make, than to celebrate the love 
and support for our country's freedom, and our patriotic nature, than this 
way: 
Imagine...The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band playing "The Star Spangled Banner," 
playing military drills as they walk around the stadium, and we celebrate 
our love for our country, and our support for all the heroes, alive and 
deceased.  Color assignments are as follows: 
                3rd deck: Red 
                2nd deck: White 
                1st deck: Blue 
Pass the word on.... we have 1 1/2 weeks!! 
The Spirit of America, and the Aggie Spirit is still alive.  God Bless 
America, the Free Nation. 
Pass it on.

Please respond to Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels =
are staying up pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took =
a shot last night & I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad a=
t me cause I didn't give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exa=
ctly how to handle it 'cause she's been going to bed a little high & gettin=
g up a little high.  But anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always=
 be mad & think I'm mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not kno=
wing if she got low after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm =
going to try to get a cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I =
think--I don't know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, sh=
e didn't eat right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast a=
cting & got in the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from =
his computer, got low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what =
scares me.  She knew to eat righ!
t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & =
I guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happe=
n to her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for=
 the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I hav=
en't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to chu=
rch & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have =
planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to=
 work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish u=
s luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was=
 expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will b=
e some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got =
back home Sunday. Hug them for me & tell Cole that Mimi can't wait to see h=
is bunkbeds. Love ya'll

"...if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and
 pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear
 from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." - 2
 Chronicles 7:14

 Bryant Gumbel recently interviewed Billy Graham's daughter.

 Gumbel: "Why didn't God stop this or do something about this?"

 Billy Graham's daughter: "For years we have told God we didn't want
 Him in our schools. We didn't want Him in our government and we
 didn't want Him in our finances and God was being a perfect gentleman in
 doing just what we asked Him to do. We need to make up our mind - do
 we want God or do we not want Him. We cannot just ask Him in when
 disaster strikes."

 Bryant Gumbel was silent.

How true - isn't it amazing and wonderful to see prayers in public -
Congress on the Capitol steps.  It would be interesting to know when this
original prayer was given - I can not imagine people walking out of prayers
at this point in time...

A little something to make us think about the impact
we might make on our world if only we would be willing
to try!

OPENING PRAYER -- KANSAS STATE SENATE
Thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given
in KANSAS at the opening session of their Senate. It
seems prayer still upsets some people.

When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new
session of the KANSAS SENATE, everyone was expecting
the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:

OPENING PRAYER -- KANSAS STATE SENATE
Thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given
in KANSAS at the opening session of their Senate. It
seems prayer still upsets some people.

When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new
session of the KANSAS SENATE, everyone was expecting
the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:

" Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance.

We know Your Word says, "Woe to those who call evil
good", but that is exactly what we have done.

We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values.  We confess that.

We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and
called it Pluralism.

We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery,

We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare,

We have killed our unborn and called it choice,

We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable,

We have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self-esteem,

We have abused power and called it politics,

We have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called
it ambition,

We have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement,

We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment.

Search us, Oh, God, and know our hearts today; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free.  Guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of Your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of Your Son, the living Savior, Jesus
Christ.  " Amen.!! "

The response was immediate. A number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest.  In 6 short
weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is
pastor, logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively.  The church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from India, Africa, and Korea.
Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program, " The Rest of the Story ", and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired. With the Lord's help, may this prayer
sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our
desire so that we again can be called, " one nation
under God. " If possible, please pass this prayer on
to your friends.  Think about this: If you forward
this prayer to everyone on your email list in less
than 30 days it would be heard by the world.
