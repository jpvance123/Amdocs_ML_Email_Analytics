The company for which the account needs to be set up is:

ECT Europe Finance Inc. (company 030S).

I believe that this company's constitutional docs are held in Houston - and my guess is that the authorized officers are also in Houston.  I suggest that you liaise with the company secretarial department in Houston (Kate Cole) to resolve this.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

Edmund

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Anker
Importance:	High

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Sara and Marie,
Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.  

MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.

As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.

Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.

Please advise.

Sara and Donna,
Gary has agreed that the Convertible Arbitrage Book should be transferred back to ECT Investments Inc. The Convertible Arbitrage Book was moved from ECT Investments, Inc. to Enron North America Corp., effective 1QTR2001.  

We will need to get this done before year-end.  The Convertible Book will need to be reported at year-end for SEC 13F reporting.  We want it included in ECT Investments' 13f  rather than do a ENA filing.

Theresa is calling GS and MSDW to see what they will require.

Gary,

Have you had a chance to think about this?

Farzad says it does not matter to him whether he trades as ENA, ECT Investments or XXX.

One important thing I just thought about is that I do not think we would want the Convertible Arbitrage Book Trading in London as Enron North America Corp.  Whether we are trading from London or Houston, our counterparties will be the same on Convertible Arbitrage Trading though the %s may change.  We use the Agent, Enron Investment Services Limited in London, to trade on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  

Thanks,

Gary,

How strongly do you feel about not having the Convertible Arbitrage Book in ECT Investments?

We could move the Convertible Arbitrage Book back into ECT Investments before year-end.  Otherwise, we will need to do SEC 13f reporting for ENA.  

My concern would be:
Enron may not want to disclose certain positions in the Merchant Portfolio which are in the name of ENA.  We would need to include in the reporting all ENA Longs, long puts and long calls  >$200,000.  I am not sure how much we actually have in the name of Enron North America.
Does Enron want to do a SEC 13F with the Enron North America name and address?

If we move to a totally separate entity, we will need to set up new Prime Broker (2)  and Executing Broker Agreements (27)  for the new entity.

The return on capital can continue to be calculated based upon selected books.  

Thanks. Sheila

Subject:	ECT Europe/Bear Stearns Account

We have been advised by Mary Kay Lemont that Bear Stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature.

Will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on Enron Credit's behalf?  If so, will you provide me with a current list?

Additionally, is this the only position that will be in this account?

Thanks!

Marie

Mike Kustra was in to meet Gary for Morgan Stanley today.

Mike has been told that the only thing outstanding is the place of jusidiction and Chicago has been agreed to as the compromise.

Please let me know if this agrees with your view.

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Can we locate a copy of a nexisting executing agreement for ECT or ENA.  CSFB has no record of any modified agreement.  If we could locate and fax over they will use the prior execute.

Alternatively could we continue the process of marking up the agreement they emailed.

It turns out there is one other unsettled trade that they may not be able to push through if we cannot move this through quickly.

Thanks,

Tom

You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,

	We are looking to restart the process of  establishing an executing broker agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  We had temporarily put this on hold due to the WTC attack.  We have been given a new contact.  Sheila had previously already sent the memo to authorize going forward with the process.  Below are their requirements for account set up:

1.  Corporate Resolution
2.  Trading Authorization
3.  Settlement Instructions.


I am trying to get them to fax me their broker agreement.  As soon as I receive some documentation, I will forward to you.

Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Marie - Veronica is on vacation this week, but we can still provide you with the current list.  AC, please call her and get her our most current list.

FYI, Donna Lowry's just recently out on maternity leave, but is still dedicated enough to be working out a transition of the maintenance of the authorized trader list to her group while she's out.  It's just tough this week due to her unexpected early delivery and Veronica's vacation. Please bear with us.

Have you had a chance to update the authorized trader list for ENA?  It is getting critical that we update it as we are getting requests from some of the brokerage firms for an updated list. 

Please either send me the changes to the list I sent you last week or just let me know the status.

Gary has authorized on-line FX trading with JP Morgan Chase.  We have an existing Master Agreement with Chase and would be extending our relationship to include Online Currency Trading.  Chase is a major trading partner for the Rate & Currency group.

I just spoke with Sheila Glover and she identified an account with a prime broker account already set up that may suit our needs.

The account is:
ENRON Investments Ltd.

It appears to roll into Enron Europe 

It was originally set up as ENRON Investments PLC but changed to LTD.

It was created to affect the transfer of the MG shares and currently has no assets in it.

It is structured as a holding company of MG Metals.

Hopefully this account will yield some options.

Dear All,

Thank you to everyone who has helped out today with the hopeful transfer of Anker positions from Enron Credit Inc. to ECT Europe Investments Inc. for quarter end.

We are still working on an effective means to move the positions over.  

David Wall and Edmund Cooper in London will be working on this in the am for us.

>From many discussions here today our options right now appear to be:

1.Transfer via stock power to ECTEI Inc.
Positions must be in certificate form first
Will take over a week to obtain certificates from DTC
NOT PLAUSIBLE

2. Set up prime broker account for ECTEI Inc. and transfer via DTC 
Must fill out paperwork and set up account before transfering position
Highly unlikely to accomplish in one day considering amount of paperwork and signatures required

3. Find a merchant account with a prime account already set up 
May not satify audit requirements, but many US entities have accounts
Possibly can find a Europe account with a custody or prime account that can accept DTC positions
Potential Cayman entities that roll to Europe with accounts

4. Internal structures
Suggestions Please

Ms. Lemont:

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the
referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign
the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of
ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear
Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the
corporate documentation?

Subject: Prime Brokerage Clearance Services Agreement


Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Importance:	High

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Sara and Donna,
Gary has agreed that the Convertible Arbitrage Book should be transferred back to ECT Investments Inc. The Convertible Arbitrage Book was moved from ECT Investments, Inc. to Enron North America Corp., effective 1QTR2001.  

We will need to get this done before year-end.  The Convertible Book will need to be reported at year-end for SEC 13F reporting.  We want it included in ECT Investments' 13f  rather than do a ENA filing.

Theresa is calling GS and MSDW to see what they will require.

Gary,

Have you had a chance to think about this?

Farzad says it does not matter to him whether he trades as ENA, ECT Investments or XXX.

One important thing I just thought about is that I do not think we would want the Convertible Arbitrage Book Trading in London as Enron North America Corp.  Whether we are trading from London or Houston, our counterparties will be the same on Convertible Arbitrage Trading though the %s may change.  We use the Agent, Enron Investment Services Limited in London, to trade on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  

Thanks,
Sheila

Gary,

How strongly do you feel about not having the Convertible Arbitrage Book in ECT Investments?

We could move the Convertible Arbitrage Book back into ECT Investments before year-end.  Otherwise, we will need to do SEC 13f reporting for ENA.  

My concern would be:
Enron may not want to disclose certain positions in the Merchant Portfolio which are in the name of ENA.  We would need to include in the reporting all ENA Longs, long puts and long calls  >$200,000.  I am not sure how much we actually have in the name of Enron North America.
Does Enron want to do a SEC 13F with the Enron North America name and address?

If we move to a totally separate entity, we will need to set up new Prime Broker (2)  and Executing Broker Agreements (27)  for the new entity.

The return on capital can continue to be calculated based upon selected books.  

Thanks. Sheila

Sara and Marie,
update....
Monument
I spoke with Monument last week.  They are e-mailing to me an electronic version of their Executing Broker Agreement.  They use Credit Lyonnais as their back office.  We will be clearing via GSI and Morgan Stanley for our London accounts.  The original agreement was in the name of Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (They took it off Michael Towarek's business card.  I have explained to them that the agreement should be in the name of ECT Investments, Inc.).  I called this morning to say it still has not been received.  They are still working on it.  I also need the agreed upon commission rate agreed between Mike and Monument.  This agreement will cover equities, futures and options.

Metler
I have spoken with Daniela Tresin at Metzler to see if any agreement is required with Metzler.  Metzler does not require anything but I called Pariba Milan and Phillip Bano is checking for me to see what is required by Paribas who clears for Metzler.  This relationship is for Italien equities and we will clear through GSI and Morgan.

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
   more
      appropriate to general terms of business which principally
   contemplate
      the
      regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event of
      inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

      I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the "Agreement")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

These are the documents that Bear will require for the new account.  They have agreed to accept the same terms we negotiated for the ECI account.  Mary Kay at Bear should be able to help coordinate the effort from Bear's side.

If we can locate the ECI execution doc can we simply duplicate and change for the new entity's info?

Thanks,

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa
