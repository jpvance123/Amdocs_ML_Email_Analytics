Tom -

Attached is an updated version of my comments.  I have deleted Paragraph 11 dealing with the "No Other Transactions" language.  The protection term is consistent with our conversation.  

Please let me know when this agreement is ready to be finalized and I will do so for you .

Mark

14(c) was removed because we removed Paragraph 5 - exclusivity.

I'll finalize and forward the final draft to you for forwarding to Energy Argus - unless you would prefer we do it from the Legal Dept.

I've reviewed the redline and did have one question: Why are we taking out 14(c)?

I've filled in the blanks, updated the fax numbers, and made some additional changes in Paragraph 2. 

For the time being, Net Works is still using the 1400 Smith address as everything still goes through the mail room there.

Erica -

Attached are a redlined and clean version of the Information Services Agreement between ENW and Energy Argus.  The redlined version shows the modifications made to the existing Information Services Agreement with Fieldston.  There are a few blanks that need to be completed - such as the effective date (on Page 1), the "Commencement Data" (in Paragraph 2) and a fax number for Brad (in Paragraph 15).  Also, we should double check the fax number for Argus as the number listed is a Washington D.C. number.

Finally - is ENW still using the 1400 Smith Street address or has this changed?

Please take a look at the attached and let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks for the patience.

Mark

Tana Jones,
Re: yours of October 2, 2001

Thank you for your email.

I have included you and Mark Taylor as carbon copy contacts for position
limit matters.

As per our procedures, our "initial" contact will continue to be the person
who signed and certified the Application for Exemptions for Enron North
America Corp.. We will, however, send copies to you at the same time the
original letter is sent.

Anthony V. Densieski

Good morning wine lovers,

I am so excited about the following list of wines that I can hardly contain
myself.  It appears that all the hard work I am doing to procure the best
wines possible is beginning to be recognized by the Wine

listed below are EXTREMELY LIMITED.  I suggest calling me ASAP to reserve a
few bottles before they are just a memory.

each
    * F & L Pillot Puligny Montrachet Noyers Brets 1998 (91 points,
Spectator) $72.50 each

points, Spectator) $39.50 each

Carol,
	I have another customer, Cross Oil and Refining.  They have some gas hedges on that they would like to terminate and pay us up-front.  I don't believe they have a master ISDA agreement, can they do this transaction?   Thanks.

Hi Tana,

I was just wondering if you could assist with the status of the following PA's.  I understand these are awaiting approval by Legal and Contracts, Houston, having already been approved by Credit, Sydney:

	Company			Name			Date Submitted
NTT Communications		Taka Maeda		7 June 01
Yuen Foong Yu Paper		Yileng Tseng		10 Aug 01
Beijing Zhengcheung Technology	Mr. Hwzhao		17 Aug 01
Moraka Pte				Venkatesh Raman	13 Sept 01
Terragate Pty Ltd			Charlie Bell		12 Sep 01
Mitsui Mining Australia		Akihiro Imazawa		9 Oct 01
Coal & Allied Operations		Matthew Wall		6 Nov 01
Nipponkoa Insurance		Kenji Terauchi		6 Nov 01

As I am sure you can appreciate, I have had several inquiries regarding these applications.  With the exception of the last 2 which have only recently been entered, these PA's for the most part seem to be taking quite a long time.  Any information you can provide regarding the status of any of the above would be greatly appreciated

Thank you and regards,

Alison Keogh

Stephanie -

The below information is a modification to the ETA for Austin Energy.  This is something that appears to have fallen through the cracks as Dan Hyval was supposed to work with Tana and I to get the amendment letter put in place so that Austin Energy could transact on EOL.

Please verify that Austin Energy is currently an approved counterparty for gas trading.  If so, please prepare an appropriate ETA amendment letter making the modifications indicated in the attached.  I would like to see the draft before we send anything out to Donna.

Thanks.

Mark

Here are the changes necessary to complete the agreements in a manner that
mirrors APB's documents.  Please let me know if you have any questions or
concerns with these changes.

The one item that does not mesh with our agreement is the payment terms
outlined in the Fee Agreement document.  If you remember, we pay this fee on
a quarterly basis.  I have already called Bob and informed him we would be
changing this section to mirror the agreement for APB.  The only difference
is the price!

Thanks,
Chris

Lara,

We are finalizing a Broker Client deal with the referenced companies.  We are giving them access to European Gas, European Power, European Weather, European Bandwidth, European Coal and Brent Crude.  Is it appropriate to use the following as the exhibit for this transaction?  

UK and European Gas
UK and European Power [McKinney, Lara]   - In this case 'European Power' does NOT include Nordic Power? 
European Coal [McKinney, Lara]   - Do you mean ONLY European Coal and do not want to include US as well?  
European Weather [McKinney, Lara]   In this case 'European Weather' does NOT included Nordic Weather? 
European Bandwidth [McKinney, Lara]   There is an initiative to launch Asian Bandwidth products.  This is a ways from launch yet, but do you want it included? 
Brent Crude [McKinney, Lara]   This one is pretty broad - since you have not listed a country, can I assume that you mean US, UK, and Asian Brent products?

Are there changes to the managers for the above entity?  Current managers are Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley; with many business units removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule, I did not know if your entities would be subject to the same.

Please let me know.  Thanks.

Nature of Discussions:

Several groups within Enron (RAC, Enron Direct North America, Enron Direct Canada,  Enron Direct U.K., Enron Credit) use credit scoring information to approve/deny credit to potential counterparties associated with deal flow.  D&B, the top source of this information in North America, only covers about 60% of the counterparties in which we have interest.  We want to bring Experian data into the credit process to get North American coverage up >90%.  It is possible that will want to use Experian to support Canada, UK, Spain and Netherlands markets as well.  As we get into discussion with Experian, we will need to reveal details about RAC, EES, EC, our systems, marketing plans, target acceptance rates, etc.  They will need to reveal limitations relating to coverage, interfaces, data structure, etc.  It is the coverage of these discussions I am seeking.

Kim -

Please provide me with the full name and address for Experian.  Also, we can forward the agreement on your behalf if you provide us with an e-mail address and contact name.  Finally, please give me some indication of the exact nature of the discussions, if there is any need to make the NDA specific vs. general.

If you provide these items today, we should be able to get our language out later this afternoon, tomorrow moring at the latest.

I have started discussions with Experian, likely to result in Experian becoming Enron's #2 provider of credit scoring data.  I need to get an NDA in place with Experian ASAP to cover sensitive items likely to be covered during our negotiations.  I would like to get our NDA language to them today.  Please advise as to how to proceed...

                           READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END-THERE'S A TRICK TO IT. 

                           Finally a Barbie I can relate to.    At long last, here are some NEW 
                           Barbie dolls to coincide with her and OUR aging gracefully. These 
                           are a bit more realistic... 

                           1. Bifocals Barbie.     Comes with her own set of blended-lens 
                           fashion frames 
                           in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain, and large-print 
                           editions   of  Vogue and Martha Stewart Living. 

                           2. Hot Flash Barbie.      Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her 
                           face  turn 
                           beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her forehead. 
                           Comes with handheld fan and tiny tissues. 

                           3. Facial Hair Barbie.     As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her 
                           whiskers 
                           grow.   Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying mirror. 

                           4. Flabby Arms Barbie.     Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these 
                           new,roomier-sleeved gowns.   Good news on the tummy front, 
                           two-MuMus with tummy-support panels are included. 

                           5. Bunion Barbie.    Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have 
                           definitely 
                           taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe her sores with 
                           the 
                           pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft terry mules. 

                           6. No-More-Wrinkles Barbie.     Erase those pesky crow's-feet and 
                           lip lines 
                           with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line of 
                           exclusive 
                           age-blasting cosmetics. 

                           7. Soccer Mom Barbie.     All that experience as a cheerleader is 
                           really paying 
                           off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone to root for 
                           Babs and 
                           Ken, Jr.    Comes with minivan in robin-egg blue or white and cooler 
                           filled with 
                           doughnut holes and fruit punch. 

                           8. Mid-life Crisis Barbie.      It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a 
                           change, 
                           and Alonzo (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor ordered, 
                           along with 
                           Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata and heading for the 
                           Napa 
                           Valley to open a B&B.     Includes a real tape of "Breaking Up Is 
                           Hard to Do." 

                           9. Divorced Barbie.     Sells for$ 199.99.   Comes with Ken's house, 
                           Ken's car, 
                           and Ken's boat. 

                           10. Recovery Barbie.     Too many parties have finally caught up 
                           with the 
                           ultimate party girl.    Now she does Twelve Steps instead of dance 
                           steps.   Clean 
                           and  sober, she's going to meetings religiously.   Comes with a little 
                           copy of 
                           The Big Book and a six-pack of Diet Coke. 

                           11. Post-Menopausal Barbie.     This Barbie wets her pants when 
                           she sneezes, 
                           forgets where she puts things, and cries a lot.     She is sick and 
                           tired of Ken 
                           sitting on the couch watching the tube, clicking through the 
                           channels.     Comes 
                           with Depends and Kleenex. As a bonus this year, the book "Getting 
                           In Touch with Your Inner Self" is included. 
  

                          The one I got said that if you forward to 11 people a very funny; video comes on your screen.   Who knows?  I just thought it was cute.

Tana,

I think I got all you Ben Laden Emails (3?).

The one with the "Day-O" theme has got to be the funniest.  The wierd thing
is I was thinking there should be a song likethat  for this subject because
of the Taliban name.

I guess I'm not as original as I would like to think.

Anyway, thanks for making me laugh.  Unformtunatly most of the humorous
stuff I have been getting on Ben Laden has been extremely disgusting (I have
some very ill minded colleauges, so I won't be sendign you those.

As soon as I get somehting cleanrer, I'll formward it to you.

Anyway, Love Ya,

Yourr Big Bro Kyle

Steve -

Bob asked me to forward the attached amendment to the Fee Agreement to your attention for review and comment.  The amendment deals with the addition of North American Emissions to the suite of products that Amerex can access on Broker Client.  As there is no fee being paid for this additional product, we are considering access to be on a "trial" basis.  When the Fee Agreement is renewed, fees for all products can be further disussed.

Please take a look at the attached and circulate as you deem appropriate.  If you should have any questions or need anything further, please let me know.

Tana, 


It seems like the NDA was drafted for an alternative platform. I would appreciate if you could modify "EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information a possible transaction or other business relationship involving an alternative trading platform for certain Enron transactions"  

for something along the lines of :"EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving clearing or credit wrapping of EnronOnline transactions."

Thank you, 

Marc Eichmann

Gary -

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.  I have checked my files and those maintained by Tana Jones in relation to EOL contracts and amendments.  I have also asked Leslie Hansen about this matter.  Unfortunately, we do not have any files for Austin Energy nor can we locate any information on negotiations associated with the EOL contract.   Information on counterparties is maintained in our database for all counterparties we are contracting with or contracted with and Austin Energy does not show up.

If AE has information that we have looked at in the past, the only thing I can do is ask that it be forwarded to me for review.  Though I will be out of the office tomorrow, I will give this matter my full attention once I have the necessary information.

Thanks.

Steve,

I hope this email gets through to you this time.   Rather than the Nov 1st or 2nd dates I list below, perhaps we can shoot for Nov. 19, 20,21 or Nov. 26 or 27th.   Hopefully, your legal group and my legal group can execute the NDA by those dates.    I will have a better answer for you regarding the structures of Enron's LJM and Chewco investment vehicles as soon as possible.  Please contact me with any concerns or questions.   Thanks again.

Subject:	EnronOnLine Demonstration & Meeting

Steve,

It was good speaking with you this morning.   I would like to cover a few housekeeper issues and to plan for our next meeting and the EnronOnLine (EOL) demonstation. 

Non-Disclosure Agreement

The demonstration will show you how the Market Manager programs work, the different behind-the-scenes administrative and data modules, and the screens a trader would use to load and trade on the system.    In order to show these proprietary functions and screens, my management is requiring third parties to sign a confidentiality agreement.   I have attached this agreement.   Please have your legal team review it and direct questions to Tana Jones, paralegal, at 713-853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, legal counsel, at 713-345-8897. 


Suggested Day and Time for the Meeting & Demonstration

How is November 1st or 2nd ?   What days are good for you and your team?


Format of the Demonstration

We can provide various ways to demonstrate EOL and its applications.   The simpliest way may be for HETCO to provide us with one or two desktops or laptops in order to view a remote, internet, demonstration from Houston, which would also feature an open phone line to my demo-team in Houston.  In this way, HETCO and Enron get a live demonstration of the EOL system, but avoid the IT headaches of opening up the necessary internet port and setting aside the required IP addresses, which are necessary if Enron were to bring its own laptops and projectors.   I can work with someone from your IT department to work out these details.

Thanks again for this opportunity.   Please reply or call me with any questions.     I look forward to our next meeting.

Marie:

Please place Michael Schuh by RWE and Raoul Saxena by J Aron instead of me as I am only acting as a Houston resource to Michael and Raoul as necessary. They are handling the negotiations. You should also add them to the distribution list. Thanks.

Ray -
 
The changes made are acceptable.  I will have two originals circulated internally for signature and forward them to your company for counter-signature.
 
As I will be out of the office through tomorrow, it may be the end of the week before you have the agreements in hand.

Mark, 

        Attached you'll find a clean and blackline version of the revised agreement which reflects changes resulting from your items 1,2,3 and 5 below.  The intent behind not changing item 4 is that if Enron were to use the software in one of the identified "dangerous or hazardous" uses Enron would be on it's own.  If you have any further questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me at 978 322-4220.  Otherwise please arrange to execute 1 original and fax it to me at 978 322-4100 for counter signing.

Thanks, 

Ray

Subject: RE: Quallaby / Evaluation Agreement 

Ray - 

Thanks for the response and the black line.  Below are my additional 

comments: 

1.  The reference to "Hardware Products" needs to be deleted, as does the 

Schedule B.  It is my understanding that the hardware is provided by a 

different vendor.  If it is necessary to reference the hardware as a 

requirement for running the software programs, this should be listed in 

Schedule A as a specification. 

2.  Paragraph 2.1 - the term "its best efforts" should be replaced with 

"reasonable efforts" and, if it is Quallaby's position that Enron pursue 

confidential treatment of the information, despite legal requirements to 

disclosed placed on Enron, the reasonable cost for pursuing this protection 

should be borne by Quallaby. 

3.  Paragraph 3.2 - the change made at the end of the paragraph needs to 

read "... BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 

INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.1(a) AND 3.1(b) ABOVE."  Since neither 

of the referenced provisions are, themselves, warranties, it is incorrect 

to reference them in 3.2 as being warranties. 

4.  Paragraph 3.3 - the following language should be inserted after the 

word "applications" - "save and except for any indemnity obligations of 

Quallaby set forth in Section 3.1 above."  By not having this reference, it 

is possible that section 3.3 could be read to negate Quallaby's obligations 

as set out in Section 3.1. 

5.  In Section 5 of the Agreement - a new paragraph should be added as 

paragraph 5.9 to indicate as follows:  "The provisions of Sections 2, 3 and 

4 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement."  This is 

more so important now that Quallaby has included specific provisions 

enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an infringement 

claim. 

With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the agreement, 

we are prepared to move this matter forward. 

Thanks for your continued assistance and cooperation. 

Mark

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change

I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the

Tana -

Please be in touch with Bob to confirm the appropriate name.  Also, if the name is different than APB, we need to confirm that any collateral they posted, if any, is capable of covering the different entity.  Please also confirm with Bob whether or not APB did in fact post any collateral.

Thanks.

Mark

We need to verify with Joe what the name should be.  They acquired these firms and I'm not sure how the document should be drafted.

Is there a different name for APB Energy Europe or are we doing additional deals?

Many thanks.  
As soon as I receive the document from Houston I will prepare a draft.

To answer your question, the ISDA will govern the transactions created by the parties.  There are various other terms and conditions on the website that govern issues such as privacy, the use of the website and the creation of transactions electronically.  If there are any particular provisions that cause you concern please let me know.

Tana I should be grateful if you could send the ISDA to me.

		TO:	All Exchange Members and Member Firms

		RE:	Registration for the NYMEX ACCESS
 Internet-Based
Trading Platform
_________________________________________________________________

During the week of October 8-12, tables were set up on both the NYMEX  and
COMEX Division trading floors to distribute applications to members to
register as users of the new NYMEX ACCESS
 trading platform, which has been
internet-based since September 14. Many members have already completed these
applications and are approved.

The specific application requirements for registration differ according to
individual membership designations. The applications have been sorted
according to the following:

*	Previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users
*	Non-previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users who are seat owners
*	Non-previously approved NYMEX ACCESS
 users who are seat leasees

If you have not already obtained the appropriate application, you can do so
by contacting Bridget DelPlato in the membership department at 212-299-2375.
Any completed applications should be returned to the membership department
as well.

Members are encouraged to complete these applications in the event that
there is any interruption to the operation of the trading facility and a
decision is made to temporarily utilize the NYMEX ACCESS
 system as a
substitute.

Berco Resources Inc, K#96000645, CP ID #26557.
 
The Counterparty system indicates that this counterparty was suspended on 3/15/01.  Cheryl Johnson's (Counterparty Group) comments state:  
 
"Spoke to Bill Bergner who states that he has sent documentation to legal regarding the conversion.  He said they did business under a group of different entities other than "Inc."  In Jan. '99, they combined those entities to form the LLC, so it wasn't a simple conversion per se.  He also stated that this entity should be deleted (inactivated), as there will be no business conducted in that name.  This record will be suspended pending inactivation."
 
Does anyone in legal know anything about this because we do have an active contract in the contract system?
 
This is part of the contract audit I've been working on.
 
Thanks, - g

Tried to call with more questions:
Where is the money coming from?
Why is this trade being done out of this entity and not Enron Corp like the
others?

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Sibyl:

Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change
signature lines?
I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the
Schedule) but not the Repo.

Thanks.  Sara

I am meeting with Eduardo at 9:30am on Monday, so is there any way someone can look at it today.  I am fine with it being finalized on Monday morning before my meeting, but if there is a problem with their revised language -- need to address that today.  Please let me know.

Thanks
Ross

Tana,

Attached you will find the comments on the NDA from BoozAllen Hamilton.  Any chance we could get this spun back to them today?  

I provided you with the wrong email address for Eduardo yesterday -- the correct address is:

alvarez_eduardo@bah.com

Ross

Travis,
 
I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.  We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy.

Tana,

The instructions don't work, and quite frankly, I don't have the luxury of waiting for an IT guy to help me.  Is it possible for you to print out the Alcoa isda and fax it to me at the below fax number?  I need it on an urgent priority basis.  If you can't fax it to me, please let me know.

Thanks,

Limor,

The instructions below should help you find the access to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database (where the ISDA information is located).   If you want to get into where the documents are actually stored online, you need to contact Moyez Lallani, and he can get you access to Livelink.  Tell him you are in Legal in New York and you need access ASAP.  Then just have your computer guy up there set up up an Icon.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

Hello, 

Any GCP Adjustments will be highlighted in blue.  Also please note that Electrical District Number Eight has been confirmed with the Counterparty, so there will not be a CP ID until we confirm the information with the company.  I will send another spreadsheet with the CP ID as soon as the information is confirmed.  Please feel free to give me a call, if you have any questions.

To all:

This is in Veronica Espinoza's court.  Ed Sacks was involved only to the extent that the agency structures needed to be reviewed and understood by Credit.  Apparantly, these entities will be trading NG, but I am awaiting further details from Veronica.  I will update the database accordingly.  Please let me kow if there are any other questions.  Thanks!

I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.  I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.  So, I am waiting on Credit...

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Please use the attached Gas Adoption Agreement that I have just revised with Jeff's input.  Please note that if you have Gas Industries Standards Board (GISB) Master, the Schedule B language will have to be changed to conform to the GISB nomenclature.  Jeff will send everyone a sample of a GISB type adoption agreement once he's completed
an example of one.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding the attached.

FROM:	J. Robert Collins Jr., President

RE:		Natural Gas Futures Opening Procedures Six Month Rolling
Open

Please be advised that beginning Friday, December 7, 2001, the Exchange will
implement a six month rolling open in Natural Gas Futures.  The new opening
will be conducted as follows:

During the opening of Natural Gas Futures the spot month will be opened.
After a one minute period the second contract month will be opened, the
first month will remain open for trading.  When another minute has elapsed
the third month will be opened, the spot and second month will remain open.

This procedure will continue through the first six contract months.  At the
conclusion of the opening period for the first six nearby months, all other
contract months will be opened simultaneously.

Anytime during the open, members can trade outright trades and spreads in
any of the months that have been previously opened.

Should you require additional information regarding these procedures, please
call Robert Stasi 299-2067 or Brian Bartichek 299-2057.

As you are aware a "safety net" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.

Any questions, call me.

Could you please forward a draft NDA to Rick Gomes at HSBC.  They are looking at a potential Object Code license or the potential to post their F/X products on EOL.

Hi Brandon

I received your message and have been attending an off-site this week
so apologies for the day delay in responding.

We have reviewed a couple of different possibilities which I will describe and
then
based on your needs, we can follow up with the more specific questions.

The simplest and fastest path to take would have us streaming FX quotes to
your site, preferably via RV messsaging. These would be indicative quotes and
could be streamed 24 hours/day. For trading,we could place on the site a button
that would launch
a new HTML window that would in effect be our app that could credit check,
quote,
and autotrade the transaction.

The second path involves integration into your platform. The main issue I see is
the construction
of the price-we would typically tier based on the transaction size and currency.
Our platform
ordinarily requires the user to state the currency pair and amount before we
transmit the quote.
We also have 'brakes' on the system; sanity checks, staleness checks etc that
temporarily
disable autotrading and alert the traders. If the second path is preferred, I
believe we would need
to see if your market manager could handle our requirements or if we need to use
a different
approach. I believe the credit checking portion would not be a difficult hurdle.

The third path is a white labelling type approach where we simply provide Enron
with liquidity,
and Enron uses our price as a wholesale source, adds whatever spreads it would
like, and be
in the middle of the transaction. I understand this would be a business decision
away from
you, but if it is a possibility that would change the technical requirements.

I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon to follow up .

Thanks

Rick Gomes

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  


Thanks,

Patrick

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

All,

ENA has a new registered agent as of its February 2001 filing of a "Certificate of Change" with the Delaware Secretary of State.

As a result, I have updated those SWAP FORMS which include a "process agent" provision.  For your convenience, attached are REDLINED versions of the following documents:

	1.  Deemed ISDA

		 

	2.  Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. 
Enron Messaging Administration

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Sharon,

BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.

THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!

Good afternoon, I work with Cheryl Johnson in Global Counterparty doing name changes, acquisitions, and mergers and have run into a minor setback with one of the counterparties:

I received a lead from one of my co-workers that a merger and concurrent name change had occurred involving the above referenced entities.  To follow up on the lead I spoke to Howard Boigon at 303-575-0143, he is the lawyer handling the transaction, and I requested documentation in the form of copies of Secretary of State documents relevant to the changes.  Mr. Boigon informed me that he had forwarded a DPL Notice to you with a "complete package" detailing the transaction.  He refuses to send anything further until I get with you and find out if what he sent is sufficient; if it is not he has requested that someone from legal call him and explain what we need and why.

Could you please follow up with me on this issue...don't you just love Mondays?!

Would you please develop an NDA for the following prospective client:

Anglo American plc

This will be for a potential private eMarketplace software license sale, similar to my other prospects.

Would you please e-mail me one this afternoon if at all possible?  I am going to send him an e-mail summarizing today's conversation and would like to include this as an attachment.  I'll have Johan get his lawyer to talk to you if they have questions.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Monday, December 03, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,500)			=
$4,500
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)			=	-
$4,000
Net Scan Risk		($4,500-$4,000)			=		$
500
Spread Rate			(1* $500)			=	+
$   500
Total Requirement						=
$1,000
Scan Risk Example Summary
Margin on a Spread Between a Tier 1 and Tier 2 Futures Contract

Gas spread credits.
Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright and spread margins for
the NYMEX Natural Gas (NG).

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Timing is everything.  Today I spoke to DB about the ETA amendment.  Unfortunately, many of their workers remain quite shaken by the Sept. events as their office is farily close to ground zero.  

We have one issue outstanding.  I have provided language to their counsel that I believe will satisfy their concerns.  I am not waiting for an approval of that language.  Presuming it comes this week, we should be done.

Please let me know if any of you should have any further questions.

Thanks.

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary

Notice No. 01-437
December 20, 2001

TO:		All ACCESS/C21 Frame Relay Users

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 Frame Relays


Thank you for your patience and understanding concerning the frame relay
equipment issue.  I'm pleased to inform you that the Exchange has made a
final decision on the disposition of this equipment.

Please be advised that AT&T will be contacting you shortly to arrange for
disconnection and removal of the router and modem only for those NYMEX
ACCESS
 and C-21 users connecting to our systems via frame relay.  This is
AT&T's equipment and they will arrange for its pickup.  Users are
responsible for the costs associated with any AT&T equipment that might be
damaged or lost.

All NYMEX ACCESS
 terminal holders must contact their telephone carrier to
arrange for the discontinuance of phone service to their terminal.  Since
the user set up the account with AT&T, they are responsible for contacting
the carrier and making arrangements for this service to be discontinued.
The Exchange will not do this.  This should be completed as quickly as
possible since the Exchange will not pay for any reimbursement costs
incurred after December 31, 2001.

Finally, with reference to the NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 terminal equipment
itself, the Exchange requires that NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 frame relay
holders write or email the NYMEX Customer Service Call Center (NCSCC) with
their intention to return the equipment to the Exchange at their own cost,
or to keep the equipment and continue using it for NYMEX ACCESS
  and / or
C-21 usage.

To contact NYMEX Customer Service, call: #1-800-438-8616 or e-mail:
CUSTCARE@nymex.com.
To send your response via post, please mail to:
New York Mercantile Exchange
Customer Service Department
World Financial Center
One North End Avenue
14th Floor
New York, NY 10282
Attention: Robert Dagistino, Director and/or Mildred Rodriguez, Business
Analyst

Should you decide to keep the equipment and continue to use C-21 and/or
NYMEX ACCESS
, please be advised that effective December 31, 2001 any
license granted to the C-21 and NYMEX ACCESS
 software programs or any
third-party software that may be accessed via the terminal equipment shall
terminate.  Any use of these software programs after that date or any
copying or re-distribution of these programs is strictly prohibited.  To
continue using the equipment, you must format the hard drive and install any
operating system that supports Internet Explorer 5.1 or greater.

Should you have any questions please contact the NCSCC at 1-800-438-8616 or
e-mail at CUSTCARE@nymex.com.

Thank you for your continued support.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%	
Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9%	
Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0%	
Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8%	
Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2%	
Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

How Enron Blew It=20
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=
.php>>=20
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.

"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Joyce from Mirant is faxing it over to me and I'll forward up to Samantha.  (The other party, Transcanada, had your name as their reference for this assignment, that's why I sent my initial request to you.  Sorry)

I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that!

Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

I also noticed on Inland Paperboard and Packaging, Inc./ENA, CP #66189, we are still waiting for the executed agreement since July 10th.  Is it normal for a company to take this long to return the executed agreement?  We have set up a global contract number (96063822) to allow them to do on-line trading.

Lance,

I just walked the floors to check out our data rooms and noticed the following:

1.  Area 2991-2993 - we only have one telephone.  Can we get another installed?  There was no indication of where the portal was for the laptop (a yellow sticky that says "portal here!").  The fax machine is low on toner.  How can we locate toner at this late date to fit that fax machine?  

The three remaining areas still need their fax, printers and portals...

The fourth area 2945-2947, Room 2946 does not have a working phone.  

Esmeralda, what is the status of our coffee thermos's, coffee cups, sugar, creamer, office supplies?  I noticed the printer in 2993 was low on paper.  Can we get some printer paper brought down.  The conference room on 33 needs the coffee thermos's and ice bucket rinsed out, they've got old stuff in them.  Rooms 2945 & 2946 need to be straighted up a bit.  Can you take a look at this...or do you want to go down together...

Lance & Esmeralda, I am attaching a list of the current Data Rooms for your assistance:

I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable?

					Tana, 

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

					We will prepare 32 Thursday.

Ray -

I apologize.  It appears that I did not circulate the agreement for signature.  I have done so this a.m. and it should be sent to you later today.

One note, in Paragraph 2.1, Quallaby had inserted the phrase "best efforts" in relation to action by Enron to procure protection for disclosed information.  I have revised this one item to read "reasonable efforts" - which is consistent with my comments made in other areas of the agreement.

Thanks for the patience and, once again, I apologize for the delay.

Mark

   Ray - 
   The changes made are acceptable.  I will have two originals circulated 
   internally for signature and forward them to your company for 
   counter-signature. 
   As I will be out of the office through tomorrow, it may be the end of 
   the week before you have the agreements in hand.

     Mark, 
             Attached you'll find a clean and blackline version of the 
     revised agreement which reflects changes resulting from your items 
     1,2,3 and 5 below.  The intent behind not changing item 4 is that if 
     Enron were to use the software in one of the identified "dangerous or 
     hazardous" uses Enron would be on it's own.  If you have any further 
     questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me at 978 
     322-4220.  Otherwise please arrange to execute 1 original and fax it 
     to me at 978 322-4100 for counter signing. 
     Thanks, 
     Ray

     Ray - 
     Thanks for the response and the black line.  Below are my additional 
     comments: 
     1.  The reference to "Hardware Products" needs to be deleted, as does 
     the 
     Schedule B.  It is my understanding that the hardware is provided by a 
     different vendor.  If it is necessary to reference the hardware as a 
     requirement for running the software programs, this should be listed 
     in 
     Schedule A as a specification. 
     2.  Paragraph 2.1 - the term "its best efforts" should be replaced 
     with 
     "reasonable efforts" and, if it is Quallaby's position that Enron 
     pursue 
     confidential treatment of the information, despite legal requirements 
     to 
     disclosed placed on Enron, the reasonable cost for pursuing this 
     protection 
     should be borne by Quallaby. 
     3.  Paragraph 3.2 - the change made at the end of the paragraph needs 
     to 
     read "... BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
     THE 
     INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.1(a) AND 3.1(b) ABOVE."  Since 
     neither 
     of the referenced provisions are, themselves, warranties, it is 
     incorrect 
     to reference them in 3.2 as being warranties. 
     4.  Paragraph 3.3 - the following language should be inserted after 
     the 
     word "applications" - "save and except for any indemnity obligations 
     of 
     Quallaby set forth in Section 3.1 above."  By not having this 
     reference, it 
     is possible that section 3.3 could be read to negate Quallaby's 
     obligations 
     as set out in Section 3.1. 
     5.  In Section 5 of the Agreement - a new paragraph should be added as 
     paragraph 5.9 to indicate as follows:  "The provisions of Sections 2, 
     3 and 
     4 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement." 
     This is 
     more so important now that Quallaby has included specific provisions 
     enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an 
     infringement 
     claim. 
     With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the 
     agreement, 
     we are prepared to move this matter forward. 
     Thanks for your continued assistance and cooperation.

Tana -
 
It seems that Dan may have been working on this Austin Energy deal - why I do not know.
 
Please work with Vanessa to see if we can find anything on this.

Thanks.

It might help Mark if you let know that Dan Hyvl was working on the

contract.  Also,  give him the contract name that appears at the bottom of

the hardcopy.  They should have access to Dan's old contract.

Thanks for your help with the Russian NDAs! 
They did sign them, and even then we didn't show them anything crucial, so I think we're covered.

Tana, 

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.

Lara,

We are finalizing a Broker Client deal with the referenced companies.  We are giving them access to European Gas, European Power, European Weather, European Bandwidth, European Coal and Brent Crude.  Is it appropriate to use the following as the exhibit for this transaction?  

UK and European Gas
UK and European Power [McKinney, Lara]   - In this case 'European Power' does NOT include Nordic Power? 
European Coal [McKinney, Lara]   - Do you mean ONLY European Coal and do not want to include US as well?  
European Weather [McKinney, Lara]   In this case 'European Weather' does NOT included Nordic Weather? 
European Bandwidth [McKinney, Lara]   There is an initiative to launch Asian Bandwidth products.  This is a ways from launch yet, but do you want it included? 
Brent Crude [McKinney, Lara]   This one is pretty broad - since you have not listed a country, can I assume that you mean US, UK, and Asian Brent products?

1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

The attached file contains changes, prepared by Experian's attorneys, to the NDA we sent last week.  Their legal contact is Jeannine Ford.  Jeannine's email address is Jeannine.Ford@experian.com.  Please work directly with her to resolve outstanding issues.  

We are scheduled to meet with Experian Tuesday 11/6, to discuss the application of their data.  The NDA needs to be in place by that time.

Please contact me with any questions.

Short-form FCPA clause as follows - 

 	Both parties agree that they will not, and shall procure that its Affiliates and their respective employees will not, make, cause to be made, or promise or offer to make, in connection with this Agreement, any payment, loan, gift or transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly: (i) to or for the use or benefit of any government official or government employee (including employees of government-owned entities or corporations); or (ii) to any political party, official of a political party or candidate; or (iii) to an intermediary for payment to any of the foregoing, in order to obtain or retain business or to secure any improper advantage.

I think the full one-page clause plus one-page schedule is a bit much for a confidentiality agreement but the above might be appropriate.
I will be around for a little while this evening so any other problems give me a call.
Thanks
Mike

Leslie,

I just spoke with the gas futures trader at TEA and he would like to trade on EnronOnline, but can't due to ISDA not being in place.  
I know  they trade on behalf of others, but is there anything we can to do accommodate them, in order to migrate their gas business to EOL ?

Thanks for you assistance.

Neither BP nor Dynegy agreements have executed amendments.  There do not appear to be any guarantees on the BP file.  I am going to fax to you the guarantees (and amendments) that are in the Dynegy file.

We don't have masters with any of the following entities:

Amerada Hess Corporation
Hess Energy Services Company, LLC
Hess Energy Trading Company (UK) Limited
Hess Energy Trading Company LLC

We do, however, have a CLOSED file for Amerada Hess Canada Ltd.  It was closed in 1998 and is offsite.  I don't know if the contract was fully executed or not.

Attached is a revised version of the amendment letter for the Electronic Trading Agreement.  I have added the proposed language regarding punitive damages as a new subsection to Section 4.  

Please take a look at the attached and advise accordingly.  If this is acceptable, I will finalize the agreement, get it signed and have it forwarded to you for counter-signature by DB.

Thanks for the assistane.  Glad to hear that you and your co-workers are okay in the wake of recent events.

Hi Tana,

Last time we spoke I was with the Legal team. I have since moved over to support the Power Trading team and looking after EOL, which will be fully handed over to me from Justin Timothy once access to the appropriate systems has been finalised.

I have a query on Global Counterparty ID# 115322, NTT Communications, Taka Maeda, which was originally processed on 7 June 01.  Could you please advise where we are with this one.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should there be any problems.

Thank you and regards,

Hi Tana

I am putting on the Financial Trading Agreements database ISDAs that are currently under negotiation and have a couple of questions (sorry Matt is away today).

Where the Credit Contact is not listed under the arrows how do I add a new one? I have the same problem with an Enron entity - EFET LLC is not on there.

Hope you are surviving OK over there.

We are finalizing a Broker Client deal with the referenced companies.  We are giving them access to European Gas, European Power, European Weather, European Bandwidth, European Coal and Brent Crude.  Is it appropriate to use the following as the exhibit for this transaction?  

UK and European Gas
UK and European Power [McKinney, Lara]   - In this case 'European Power' does NOT include Nordic Power? 
European Coal [McKinney, Lara]   - Do you mean ONLY European Coal and do not want to include US as well?  
European Weather [McKinney, Lara]   In this case 'European Weather' does NOT included Nordic Weather? 
European Bandwidth [McKinney, Lara]   There is an initiative to launch Asian Bandwidth products.  This is a ways from launch yet, but do you want it included? 
Brent Crude [McKinney, Lara]   This one is pretty broad - since you have not listed a country, can I assume that you mean US, UK, and Asian Brent products?

Apparently, this customer may want to transact in the next 48 hours and needs to be set-up in global.

Lorie -

Sorry for the typo and misspellings.  I have reviewed the agreement again and made changes to Paragraphs 7 and 8.  I have attached the final version below.  

As to getting this out today, that is fine.  Since I will need to initial the final letters, why don't we generate them up here and send them down for signature.  You can then attach the pricing and product description items.

Mark,

Hope you had a good weekend and thanks for the quick response.

There were a few misspellings of names and a typo which we have changed.  The only question I have is in paragraphs 7 & 8, we still refer to a Term Sheet, should this be changed to Product Description? please advise.  

 << File: loi-chisholm(11-12-01).doc >>  
Let me know if you have any problems with us sending out a letter today.  Thanks.


Make It A Great Day!!

Lorie/Carl -

Pursuant to our discussion, I have attached an updated draft of the LOI.  I have not attached either the product description nor the pricing schedule as this can be accomplished once we finalize the LOI.

Please take look at the attached and let me know if there are any further comments or questions.

Dear Ms Saarnilahti and Mr Lehtinen

I understand that Nordea has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with our affiliate Enron North America Corp.  Our understanding is that this ISDA is subject to a confidentiality provision.   I should be grateful if you could confirm to my colleague Tana Jones that a copy of the Enron North America Corp. ISDA can be released to me.  This will enable us to use that ISDA as a base for putting in place an ISDA between Nordea and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited.

If you would like to discuss this please feel free to call me on 44 207 783 2487.
regards
Janet Wood

I am sure the captioned parties have not been included in any master netting agreements to date and should not be included due to marketing affiliate rules; however, given the financings of the pipes, just a reminder TO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN ANY MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT.

Looks good. I'd suggest changing "EnronOnline website" in the first paragraph to the broader "EnronOnline eMarketplace platform" just to be safe.

This looks fine to me.  I believe that Henry Bonner of SunGard is travelling tonight and will be in Houston tomorrow.  He left a message saying that he will call with the hotel fax number when he gets to his destination.  I will forward that information as soon as I receive it so that we can get the NDA  and signed letter to him.  Henry's cell phone number is 917 373 5844 (Cell).  Thanks.

Rex/Mark -

As we discussed, I am not confident that the Automated Securities Clearance NDA sufficiently covers us in this new matter.  I have called Henry Bonner at SunGard to verify the legal structure to see if we can or cannot use it; however, he has yet to return my call.

I have prepared the attached based upon a belief that we should have in place an NDA specifically with SunGard Trading & Risk Systems.  Because we also want to move this matter forward, I have attached to the agreement a "Schedule A" in which I have outlined the work that SunGard will be performing for us - at least at the onset.  If we go beyond the first five days of this work, we should definitely have a formal consulting agreement signed to ensure we have a clear path forward on the work to be done and deliverables to be provided.

In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know if this works.

Thanks.

mark

In this regard would look up the address for PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation as such address is set out in the notice provisions of our gas master with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.

Also, could you do the same for CEG Energy Options Inc., PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If we do not have masters in place, look in other executed agreements, and if no agreements are executed please look in recent drafts of unexecuted agreements (and note that the address is from an unexecuted draft).

If you have any questions please call or email.

Mark,

Mark Greenberg asked me to check with you to see if Enron Corp. ever got Confidentiality Agreements in place with either True Exchange or BizBots?  Can you please let me know.  Thanks!

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Mark,

Thanks for your comments. I agree with you on the new text. We will not need to release counterparty data in the future. Can you send the agreement out and let me know when it is out to give them a call. With the latest developments this has really become a priority because it can potentially free up cash.

I made the modifications to the VMAC document.  While I understand the business purpose, because we do not want EOL is not and we do not want it to be considered a clearing mechanism, we want to make sure document we prepare do not made these type of references.  As these discussions relate to the platform and the manner in which it operates, would you be comfortable with :  ... would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  If this works, we can implement this language and get the agreement out.

Also, if we are going to discuss anything related to specific transactions with any counterparties or, alternatively, if discussions with VMAC progress to the point where it is contemplated that counterparty information may be released, please remember that this information is confidential and cannot be released to any third party by Enron without the express written consent of the counterparty.

It seems like the NDA was drafted for an alternative platform. I would appreciate if you could modify "EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information a possible transaction or other business relationship involving an alternative trading platform for certain Enron transactions"  

for something along the lines of :"EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving clearing or credit wrapping of EnronOnline transactions."

Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

Tana - Would you be able to help me out by looking in our ISDAs with PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation and PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and letting me know their notices addresses.  I need these as I am trying to get the requisite security registrations done in respect of the master netting agreement with PG&E.  If you are unable to assist me please let me know.

Sharon - I need your assistance with respect to the registrations that we have to do in respect of the PG&E Master Netting Agreement.  In this regard would look up the address for PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation as such address is set out in the notice provisions of our gas master with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.

Also, could you do the same for CEG Energy Options Inc., PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If we do not have masters in place, look in other executed agreements, and if no agreements are executed please look in recent drafts of unexecuted agreements (and note that the address is from an unexecuted draft).

If you have any questions please call or email.

Thanks

Notice No. 01-398

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	CORRECTION: REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to that notice, this notice includes the text of this EFS rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

Hey guys-
BASF is still not showing up as legal reviewing even thought Wendi approved on 10/16. Please make sure that this gets on to Tana, so that we can get this ID out ASAP.

Thanks!

Jennifer:

BASF slipped by.  I really thought I had taken care of that one, but I will have it completed this morning.  FYI: sometimes Credit has completed its part and Legal needs to review.  Until PCG flips the status to "Legal Reviewing" the status will still reflect "Credit Reviewing".  This usually happens intraday, as PCG is diligent about updating the status field.

Wendi,
Just wondering if things are moving ok from credit to legal in the pa database, as I seem to keep running into cps that your comment says credit approved, but the status is still at credit reviewing....
The latest is BASF Corporation. Can you make sure this moves on to legal? Gracias!

Hi Tana.

Could you please forward a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality to the following person?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Equiva and Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Tom,

With respect to this NDA, do you want us to send it directly to Deloitte, or do you want to send it to them?  If you would like us to send it to them I am going to need an email address...

Let me know what you prefer...

Tana -

Could you please prepare an NDA for Deloitte Consulting (at the Boston address that is in the Jake Staffle NDA) for CommodityLogic.  The subject matter should be generic as they are looking at Deloitte to provide some basic accounting and compliance auditing services.

Thanks.

Mark

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's
organizational ID number in the signature block where we currently obtain
its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.
This would probably save a bit of time and money.

Thanks.

Tana - - 

Are there changes to the managers for the above entity?  Current managers are Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley; with many business units removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule, I did not know if your entities would be subject to the same.

Please let me know.  Thanks.

Please see the below.  The VMAC agreement we did for CommodityLogic, if you do not already have it in your files, is in my O drive in CommodityLogic under Confidentiality Agreements.  I password protected it.  The password is "cllegal".

Mark, 

We will be discussing a clearing project with them. They would basically provide our customers on EnronOnline an alternative to trade through a cleared mechanism, at a fee to VMAC.

The contact name is 

J. Scott Perry - President & COO
VMAC

Suite 5620

Email: sperry@vmac.com

When do you think that we can have it sent?

I have run some report queries and it appears that although they have read the ETA and have about 10 users they have never traded online.  I will run the report again tomorrow morning when it is quieter on the system to be doubly sure.

Thanks

Subject:	Requests for NDAs

In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the Enron Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:

1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones
2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address
3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer
4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.
5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.
6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.

Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.

Dear Friends of Cece Fowler,

We are very sorry to let you know that Cece Fowler's mother passed away on

California with the other family members.

In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that donations be made to:

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Alan -

I have also forwarded this to Geoffrey for his review and comment.

Let me know what comments, questions or concerns either of you may have.

Thanks.

Tana,

I am following up on the issue for Maureen Piercey who is out of the
office.

Will the TransAlta guarantee provided to Enron North America for financial
deals be acceptable? TransAlta currently sleeves the financial deals
through Enron Canada, and TransAlta can not continue to do this due to the
administrative difficulties that are created by this process.

Please let me know if the guarantee attached below is acceptable, and if
Enron North America will be will to sign the ISDA amendment. If you want to
contact me directly, my number is 403-267-6992.

Thanks,
Geordie

Just wondering if you ever received the credit worksheet for this counterparty. This is the company that Lee Jackson in NGLs is so eager to get online.

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

Sorry for the misunderstanding.  Please see the attached.  I believe this is a bit more on point.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Thanks Tana. Our lawyers have reviewed and have no issues but
have asked if the time period specified in section 8 can be amended to
one year as has been the standard for our NDAs.

First, thank you all for your hard work this last week, and in advance for the next weeks to come.  
Second, suspend your preparation of Canada work reports for the time being.  I will let you know when to resume.  I simply do not have time to collate the report the next few weeks.
Third, be sure to let me know if you are having difficulties meeting deadlines, getting enough help, or the like.
Fourth, we will keep our lunch meetings as scheduled and will use the time to strategize on our current projects rather than reviewing the form etc.  We will get back to that after the workload settles down.

Thanks again.

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is "Any".  But "Any" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that "Any" means "Any Global Product" ;"Any" means "anything".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the "someone" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

	5)	Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

John -

What are we intending to get from them that would not relate to an EOL transaction?  If we believe we will discuss other matters than EOL with them, them I do not have a problem being a bit broad; however, if it is only EOL, then we should be specific.

Let me know your thoughts.

Mark

Mark

Caminus took out reference to EOL.   Would this be too broad?   How can we accommodate their wishes below?

Our attorney was fine with the NDA except that by restricting it to
information about the Enron On Line website, it would not cover material
which Caminus might disclose to you in that meeting.

Here it is back with a simple change to make it symmetric

In adopting the Master Agreement the counterparty is agreeing to procure that it will provide a guarantee in the agreed form to ERMT. Not sure we need anything else. If they agree to adopt the Master Agreement and do not provide a guarantee, we do not have to trade with the counterparty, as is the case now.

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

Subject:	Adoption Agreement applicable to ISDA Masters
Importance:	High

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

i would keep in the arbitration clause (this is better than submission to the courts).  i assume that the counterparty is a corporate or toher commercial enterprise, and that it will accept texas law?  if this is the case, what you have in the letter agreement should suffice.

Subject:	Need ASAP Help - Russian Law?

I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!

Puget Sound Energy, Inc. is NOT approved to trade US East power products.  

We trade West power under the WSPP Agreement, but we will not trade East under this agreement and do not want to trade East and West under separate contracts.

The meeting scheduled for 11:00 has been cancelled.  Time would be better spent on document review and Adoption Agreement preparation.  As to document distribution, Tana has informed that Masters are being pulled and are starting to be sent to you at this moment.  

Some of you may know that Marcus has been proceeding without physical documents by accessing Masters through Live Link.  Deb Korkmas is pursuing the obtaining of access to that database for Anne, Travis, Elizabeth and Jeff, as they have the bulk of the documents to review.  If others of you wish to have Live Link access, please call Deb.

For clarification purposes,  the Set Off provision that we are trying to adopt is merely 2 party set off; not triangular or square.  The sample clause in Travis' Adoption Agreement for Power accomplishes such goal.  Please call me if you have any confusion over which Template to use.

Jeff,  I will have the Gas Adoption Agreement to you for review before 11:00.

Please funnel any questions, problems, issues, etc. to me as they arise.  If I don't know the answer, I'll get it for you.

Steve

Stephanie -

When you get a chance, could you finalize the attached (also found in Tana's O drive).  I am not sure where the originals need to go after signed by Enron, but I have a request for that information currently out to Hess.

Thanks.

Mark

Hi Mom,
I hope you got your package by now.  I found my receipt from the post
office the other day just in case I need it.  I attached a powerpoint
presentation a friend sent me.  It is pretty good. It takes a few
seconds to load up so be patient.  Let me know if you received you
package.  Eric

I spoke with Pablo this morning and he received and is reviewing the ISDA. 
Apparently though, the address we have for him is an old one, and it was forwarded on.

The address should be:

Just wondering if you ever received the credit worksheet for this counterparty. This is the company that Lee Jackson in NGLs is so eager to get online.

Everyone,

If you have some time today, go to http://tags.dev.corp.enron.com to look at the menu and sub-menus.  Just mouse over the main items to get a drop down of the sub-menus.  Keep in mind that we'll discuss the TAGS homepage tomorrow.  Think about other color options if you don't like the current one.  If you're considering a legal disclaimer in place of the Latin text, please come up with a draft disclaimer.

See you all tomorrow at 10am.

RE: 		EXCHANGE EXTENDS ABBREVIATED TRADING HOURS INDEFINITELY

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would extend

despite the reduced hours.

Good afternoon wine lovers,
Over the past three weeks, I have been monitoring the feedback from those of you who have purchased the weekly sampler cases.  And it appears that we have found some winners.  While all the wines have been well-received, the ones below have gained a serious following in just three short weeks.  To give the rest of you a chance to see what all the buzz is about, and to help the regulars re-stock their wine racks after the Thanksgiving feast, I have put together our most recent sampler.  As always, it comes with a special price, too.

THE BEST FROM RECENT SAMPLER CASES, TOGETHER AT LAST (2 BTLS EACH): 

Finca Flichman Cabernet Mendoza Argentina 1999 (full bodied, concentrated fruit) 87 points 
Finca Flichman Malbec Mendoza Argentina 1998 (intense color, maximum Malbec expression) 87 points  
Vina Sardasol Cabernet Crianza 1995 (how did they get so much flavor at this price?!) 88 points  
L'Enclave des Papes Cabernet 2000 (surprising depth, mature fruit components) 87 points 
Chateau LaCroix Martelle Minervois 1999 (you may remember this, my house red, serious Syrah) 89 points

Hi Vince,

It was good to talk to you today.  I need the following for the NDA:
Exact legal name
Corp Address
Contact (if other than you) and title 

Hopefully we can strike a mutually fruitful relationship.

Talk to you soon,
Nick


P.S.
Also, just a couple of suggestions for your web site team.
1.  Get rid of the "boing" mouseovers on the main page.That's awful!
2.  Under "Contact" it should be more than a form to email in.  Add
contact information.

Just my thoughts.  I liked your previous site (from a user-friendliness
perspective) better.

Mark,

Hope you had a good weekend and thanks for the quick response.

There were a few misspellings of names and a typo which we have changed.  The only question I have is in paragraphs 7 & 8, we still refer to a Term Sheet, should this be changed to Product Description? please advise.  

  
Let me know if you have any problems with us sending out a letter today.  Thanks.


Make It A Great Day!!

Lorie/Carl -

Pursuant to our discussion, I have attached an updated draft of the LOI.  I have not attached either the product description nor the pricing schedule as this can be accomplished once we finalize the LOI.

Please take look at the attached and let me know if there are any further comments or questions.

Georgi,
There is an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  However, we are currently negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement to replace the old agreement.  That is why you see the status as "draft sent" - it is a draft of the new agreement that has been sent.

I am still working on this audit and I have found in Legal's Financial Lotus Notes tracking system that Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., created by Lisa Wheeler on 2/23/97, the status says "Draft Sent".  
 
It should be changed to "Executed" since there is an executed copy of their Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in Livelink.  This particular Morgan Stanley's Contract number is 95000191, CP #9409.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I received a PA for Straightline (Division of U.S. Steel) and credit approved.  I ask Global to create an CP ID.  and the ID reads.  Straightline, a dba of US Steel Corporation.  Do I have to ask customer to re-fax PA with GCP name, CP ID # 142509?  or is okay to process like Straightline ( Division of U.S. Steel) ?

Let me know,
Thank you,

Ross -

Have we signed a confidentiality agreement with Cargill?  I need to know for purposes of completing the letter for you.

Also, just so that we can keep track of the status of these matters, could you please request a letter from either me or Tana and we will prepare them.  This will enable use to keep files of the agreements and know what is going on.  It will also make the timing for initialing and signing faster as I will not have to review the agreements prior to initialiing them.

Thanks.

Mark

I spoke with a few people in our organization.  As I feared, we have
already spoke with Oracle and Siebel.  That said, we are interested in
exploring other companies that you may have stong relationships with.
One company name that came up was Novell.

Thanks for the names, I am confident that we will find something.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Tana -

I would suggest we may be better off having two agreements.  Needless to say, we need to ensure both qualify under Enron standards or that whatever mechanism of collateral, if any, has been put in place by APB is applicable to both of these entities.  

Please let me know if you need me to do anything further.

Mark

I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that!

Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!

Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fire drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

Tana,

The instructions don't work, and quite frankly, I don't have the luxury of waiting for an IT guy to help me.  Is it possible for you to print out the Alcoa isda and fax it to me at the below fax number?  I need it on an urgent priority basis.  If you can't fax it to me, please let me know.

Thanks,

Limor,

The instructions below should help you find the access to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database (where the ISDA information is located).   If you want to get into where the documents are actually stored online, you need to contact Moyez Lallani, and he can get you access to Livelink.  Tell him you are in Legal in New York and you need access ASAP.  Then just have your computer guy up there set up up an Icon.

Stephanie -

Please advise the counterparty that we will be terminating the below agreements:

	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO OIL & GAS CORP.
	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO ENERGY CORP.


There are two reasons why we wish to terminate these agreements.  First, they do not contain threshold/margining provisions, except in the case of a default or material adverse change.  Second, the documents are the old master agreements and not ISDAs. 

If the counterparty still desires to trade under the name Belco Oil & Gas Corp., I am happy to provide them with an ISDA draft, but I want to review the latest financials of Westport Resources Corporation (the surviving entity) to assess credit quality and provisions required for the new master.  They will need to provide us with the new financial information.  In the meantime, I am content to allow trading under the ISDA with Westport Oil & Gas Company.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

JRW

Tanya/Jay,
I am forwarding to you documentation from Westport Resources Corporation regarding the merger with Belco Oil & Gas.  As you know, we have existing financial agreements with both companies, as identified below:

Belco Oil & Gas - Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated July 8, 1999, which has unlimited credit
Westport Oil & Gas Company, Inc. - ISDA Master Agreement dated March 17, 1998

The Counterparty wants to retain the Belco Master.  Please let me know what Credit wants to do.

Alan/Geoffrey -

Below you will find a BETA and Fee Agreement for TFS, Inc. in relation to certain European products.  These agreements reflect that TFS, Inc. be the Broker and thus, need to be signed by the appropriate officer of TFS, Inc.  Once they have been signed (and the accurate address for TFS, Inc. completed in the BETA), they should be returned to my attention for countersignature by Enron.

Please let me know if either of you should have any questions or need anything further with regard to this matter.

Mark

Notice No. 01-409
November 29, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		TEMPORARY EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS FOR OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS IN
ENERGY MARKETS

The Exchange will introduce a temporary program beginning tomorrow that will
allow participants in its energy markets to exchange over-the-counter (OTC)
options positions for options positions on the Exchange (EOO).

This program will have a fixed 30-day time limit and will end on December
28.

EOO transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical and
exchange of futures for swaps transactions.  Two parties are allowed to
privately negotiate the execution of on- and off-exchange options positions
on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties. The transactions must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
options exposures in the same or related commodities.

These transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer
options market positions between the two parties involved in the
transaction. The clearing member representing each party will be responsible
to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of options contracts involved,
the price at which the transaction should be cleared, and the identity of
the parties involved.

Tom -

Below is an NDA for Williams along the lines we discussed on Friday.  It addresses the "System" as being the CommodityLogic products and, as to confidentiality, is intended to supercede the provisions of confidentiality found in the BETA agreement.

I have not attached a similar agreement for Dynegy as I found we have a current NDA with Dynegy I.T., Inc. - signed in April, 2001.  Though this agreement is not as specific as the form I have provided below, it should be able to be used provided (1) we are talking to the same Dynegy group and (2) we make them aware of the fact that it is applicable from the onset.  Though Dynegy also has a BETA with confidentiality language, that language is not as vast as the standard NDA.

Please take a look at the attached and let me know how you want to proceed with both interested parties.

Thanks.

Mark

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Remember that the power and gas amendments look on their face to be identical documents, and you have to read very closely to see that they are indeed different.  Are we sure that we are not looking at 2 different docs--a gas one and a power one--and concluding that they are the same and therefore that we are missing one?

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.

Notice # 01-389
November 19, 2001

TO:
All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242.

Legal friends - 

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the "title" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Diane

Tana, attached is the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Dynegy Canada Marketing and Trade, a division of Dynegy Canada Inc. (formerly Novagas Clearinghouse Limited Partnership):

	 
It appears that around March 13, 2000, we sent Dynegy Canada Inc. an Amended and Restated Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement to replace the original agreement, but it was never signed up.

The following is the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with BP Canada Energy Company (formerly Amoco Canada Petroleum Company):


	 
I will fax to you the execution pages for each agreement.

Clem,

I noted that the version you sent me was addressed to The Chase Manhattan Bank.  Actually, we are giving the Guaranty to Mahonia Limited.  Attached is the correct form of the Guaranty.

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Notice No. 01-410

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NEW TEMPORARY NYMEX RULE: EXCHANGE OF OTC ENERGY OPTIONS FOR
NYMEX ENERGY OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Yesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-409, which
summarized a new temporary procedure going into effect today that permits
the exchange of OTC energy options for NYMEX energy options (EOO).  As an
informational follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text
of the new temporary EOO rule.

				NEW TEMPORARY NYMEX RULE 6.21E

Rule 6.21E.    EXCHANGE OF OTC ENERGY OPTIONS FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH
NYMEX ENERGY OPTIONS  (Temporary Rule)

(A) (1) An exchange of Exchange energy options for, or in connection with,
an over-the counter ("OTC") energy options product (or an OTC product with
similar characteristics) (hereafter an exchange of options for options or
"EOO") consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; an OTC options
transaction and an Exchange options transaction.  At the time such
transaction is effected, the buyer and seller of the Exchange options must
be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of the OTC options.  The OTC
options component shall involve the commodity underlying the related futures
contract to the Exchange options contract (or a derivative, by-product or
related product of such commodity).  The quantity covered by the OTC options
must be approximately equivalent to the quantity covered by the Exchange
options contracts. This temporary rule shall terminate thirty (30) days
following the effective date of the implementation of the rule.

	(2) Restriction on Eligible Contracts.  EOO transactions may be
effected for transactions in any of the Exchange's energy options contracts.

	(3) Restriction on Transactions.  An EOO that establishes a NYMEX
options position for both buyer and seller shall not be permitted on the
first business day following the expired NYMEX contract.

		(B)(1)  The report of an EOO transaction shall be given on
the Floor of the Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EOO
transactions are permitted until trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the applicable expiring options contract month.

C)  A report of such EOO transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EOO as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the OTC options component of the EOO
complied with any applicable CFTC regulatory requirements at the time the
EOO was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the EOO
has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such change,
the kind and quantity of the options, the price at which the options
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EOO on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EOO transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EOO, including relevant
OTC documentation, shall be obtained by the Clearing Members from the buyer
or seller and made available by the Clearing Members for examination by the
Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or seller is a Member/Member Firm, the
Exchange may obtain the information directly from such person(s).

(2) No EOO that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second,
offsetting OTC options transaction may be transacted at any time.

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EOO transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EOO transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EOO
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange?s
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EOO pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange?s Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EOO on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EOO information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

We approved 2 of these, but need to get an amended gty from covering "Generating" before approving there.  I have talked with Stephanie Panus and she was going to take care of the Legal side.  Thanks!!

I cannot approve the referenced counterparty as agent for those three utilities until it comes thru on an overnight spreadsheet for approval from Credit.  I need to give my whole legal team around the world the opportunity to say "yea" or "nay" for legal issues with these counterparties.  So, I am waiting on Credit...

Attached are clean and redline versions of the "without margining" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Do you need the notice information in the agreements or will a listing of the chief executive offices for each work?  I have a listing of the BP Amoco entities and the addresses of their chief executive offices and I can also send Reliant's as set forth in the Master Netting Agreements.

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Subject:	Issue to be resolved and acted upon

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is "Any".  But "Any" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that "Any" means "Any Global Product" ;"Any" means "anything".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the "someone" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

	5)	Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test.

Please let me know if there are any EnronOnline trading-related matters you would like Global to address at our monthly status meeting tomorrow morning.  We would like to know if you have any feedback for us, if there is anything you wish we were doing differently, or if there is anything from the Credit and Legal departments that we should know.  

We will be meeting at 10:00 a.m. in ECN 791 and, as always, you are welcome to attend -- even if only for a few minutes.

Thanks,
Karen

Notice No. 01-398

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

Erik -

Below is a form NDA for Cargill/CommodityLogic.  The form is Cargill's form and mirrors the agreement we reached earlier this year between Cargill and NetWorks.  That agreement was negotiated with Anne Pedrero with Cargill eVentures in San Mateo, CA.  Whether or not she is the individual who should look at this agreement is up to the personnel you are dealing with at Cargill.  I would suggest, however, that if another legal person does get involved, that they be instructed to contact Ms. Pedrero to verify the terms of the agreement previously negotiated.

Please let me know if you should need anything further -- phone calls are okay.


Mark

I have now reviewed the documents and discussed them with my client. It is now proposed that the Broker be Tradition Financial Services Limited of 109-117 Middlesex Street, London E1 7JF, England. The necessary changes should be made to the documents to reflect this.In the first full paragraph on the second page of the Fee Agreement in the second line "annual" should be deleted and "at the annual rate of" should be inserted after "fee". In addition, in the same line,"North American Gas" should be deleted and there should be substituted "the products specified in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof".
I look forward to hearing from you that the above is agreed. 
Kind regards. 
Geoffrey

Alan/Geoffrey - 
Below you will find a BETA and Fee Agreement for TFS, Inc. in relation 
to certain European products.  These agreements reflect that TFS, Inc. 
be the Broker and thus, need to be signed by the appropriate officer of 
TFS, Inc.  Once they have been signed (and the accurate address for TFS, 
Inc. completed in the BETA), they should be returned to my attention for 
countersignature by Enron. 
Please let me know if either of you should have any questions or need 
anything further with regard to this matter.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.

Hi Brandon

I received your message and have been attending an off-site this week
so apologies for the day delay in responding.

We have reviewed a couple of different possibilities which I will describe and
then
based on your needs, we can follow up with the more specific questions.

The simplest and fastest path to take would have us streaming FX quotes to
your site, preferably via RV messsaging. These would be indicative quotes and
could be streamed 24 hours/day. For trading,we could place on the site a button
that would launch
a new HTML window that would in effect be our app that could credit check,
quote,
and autotrade the transaction.

The second path involves integration into your platform. The main issue I see is
the construction
of the price-we would typically tier based on the transaction size and currency.
Our platform
ordinarily requires the user to state the currency pair and amount before we
transmit the quote.
We also have 'brakes' on the system; sanity checks, staleness checks etc that
temporarily
disable autotrading and alert the traders. If the second path is preferred, I
believe we would need
to see if your market manager could handle our requirements or if we need to use
a different
approach. I believe the credit checking portion would not be a difficult hurdle.

The third path is a white labelling type approach where we simply provide Enron
with liquidity,
and Enron uses our price as a wholesale source, adds whatever spreads it would
like, and be
in the middle of the transaction. I understand this would be a business decision
away from
you, but if it is a possibility that would change the technical requirements.

I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon to follow up .

Thanks

Rick Gomes

I am working on a financial contract audit and could not find any records in the Financial Lotus Notes Tracking system for the following counterparties.  I was able to pull and make copies of the executed agreements from your legal files last week and I am sending them to the file room to be scanned into Livelink and properly filed.
 
Since the Financial tracking system is one of our means of verifying information, would you please populate this information in it?  If any of these counterparties are not active, I will need to know that information also.

Steve Hall and I do not prepare ISDAs.  They have to be prepared by the ISDA group in Houston.  A former ISDA trading attorney in Houston, Carol St. Claire, recently helped  us negotiate a couple of ISDAs with Benton and Franklin PUD's.  We should see if she can help us with this one, and if not, it has to go into the ISDA kingdom through a door opened by one Tana Jones.  Perhaps they can sort it out and let us know after reading this message. ----cgy

Please use the attached Gas Adoption Agreement that I have just revised with Jeff's input.  Please note that if you have Gas Industries Standards Board (GISB) Master, the Schedule B language will have to be changed to conform to the GISB nomenclature.  Jeff will send everyone a sample of a GISB type adoption agreement once he's completed
an example of one.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding the attached.

I need to get a copy of the above because customer wants to do the same form of ISDA docs with Enron Japan for weather trades.  Not sure whether it would have been done out of London or Houston although I suspect the former.  

If it was London, Paul, I wonder if you coudl let me know who to contact for full soft copies of the docs.

Nony, if it was Houston, do you know how I get full soft copies of all the docs (including guarantee).

Thanks to both of you.

Dear Jane McBride

I got a call from Mitsui Marine that they want to forego ISDA contract.
They and Enron credit have already had an ISDA agreement.
According to this, the contact was done under the head office guarantee basis.
(I don't know the detail)
If the contract between Enron Japan and them will be made under the same term and condition
It will be great help for both sides.
Their interest for us is only trade of weather derivatives (they don't have a needs of any other commodities). 
Could you show it them under the same term and condition?
Again if it will be all right that this thing will go smooth and quick.

Kaoru Hijikata

Tana, several months ago you & I worked on a NDA with a company called 3PARdata. The lawyers worked together and reached a version that was acceptable to both sides. However, for several reasons we did not sign it on the Enron side. I would like to resurrect this agreement with one change. I need to remove EnronOnline, LLC as one of the parties to the agreement. The agreement would be with Enron Net Works LLC and 3PARdata, Inc.

Representatives from 3PARdata will be here this Thursday (11/8) to disclose some confidential information. I would like to get our side signed and faxed to them before they COB Wednesday. I will take care of getting the Enron signature.

Please call me with any questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kevin Montagne

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Tana -

The language that we need for the subject matter of the NDA is ----   "discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  

With this change, I believe the VMAC document for Marc is ready to go.

Thanks.

Mark

Mark,

Thanks for your comments. I agree with you on the new text. We will not need to release counterparty data in the future. Can you send the agreement out and let me know when it is out to give them a call. With the latest developments this has really become a priority because it can potentially free up cash.

Marc -

I made the modifications to the VMAC document.  While I understand the business purpose, because we do not want EOL is not and we do not want it to be considered a clearing mechanism, we want to make sure document we prepare do not made these type of references.  As these discussions relate to the platform and the manner in which it operates, would you be comfortable with :  ... would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  If this works, we can implement this language and get the agreement out.

Also, if we are going to discuss anything related to specific transactions with any counterparties or, alternatively, if discussions with VMAC progress to the point where it is contemplated that counterparty information may be released, please remember that this information is confidential and cannot be released to any third party by Enron without the express written consent of the counterparty.

Tana, 


It seems like the NDA was drafted for an alternative platform. I would appreciate if you could modify "EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information a possible transaction or other business relationship involving an alternative trading platform for certain Enron transactions"  

for something along the lines of :"EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving clearing or credit wrapping of EnronOnline transactions."

Thank you, 

Marc Eichmann

Mark, 

We will be discussing a clearing project with them. They would basically provide our customers on EnronOnline an alternative to trade through a cleared mechanism, at a fee to VMAC.

The contact name is 

J. Scott Perry - President & COO
VMAC

Email: sperry@vmac.com

When do you think that we can have it sent?

Please provide me with a brief description of the project or work that is going to be discussed with VMAC and a contact name/e-mail address.  We will do the necessary conflict check and send the agreement to VMAC directly.

Thanks.

Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

Steve Hall and I do not prepare ISDAs.  They have to be prepared by the ISDA group in Houston.  A former ISDA trading attorney in Houston, Carol St. Claire, recently helped  us negotiate a couple of ISDAs with Benton and Franklin PUD's.  We should see if she can help us with this one, and if not, it has to go into the ISDA kingdom through a door opened by one Tana Jones.  Perhaps they can sort it out and let us know after reading this message. ----cgy

Legal,

Per the request of Stewart Rosman, please prepare an ISDA between Public Utility District Number One of Grays Harbor and ENA.  Credit concerns should be addressed to Tracy Ngo or myself.

Thank you,

Tana,
Wendi Lebrocq called re: Ameren Energy, Inc., as agent for Central Illinois Public Services Co. and as agent for Union Electric Company.  I put them on "T" for US physical natural gas only.  I think Wendi said they would appear on tonight's list.

Caminus took out reference to EOL.   Would this be too broad?   How can we accommodate their wishes below?

Our attorney was fine with the NDA except that by restricting it to
information about the Enron On Line website, it would not cover material
which Caminus might disclose to you in that meeting.

Here it is back with a simple change to make it symmetric

Lorie -

Attached for your review is a first draft of a proposed LOI for Chisholm.  I have added provisions that mirror the items laid out in the product description information as these are the types of things that will be addressed in the final definitive agreements.

Please review at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.

Tana, in answer to your question, the Amendent was executed, Mike, for some reason, just does not have an executed copy.  Can you go forward on the assumption that it is executed?

Mike, I copied the documents and had them delivered to Tana Jones.  I noticed at the time that there was one amendment for gas and one for power, as I heard you tell Jim.  I noticed that the copy of the gas one in the file was executed, while the one for power was not.

Tana just called and said she noticed the same thing and wondered if the Power Amendment had been executed.  Do you know if it was and we just did not have the copy in the file?  Thanks for your help.

Christy

This morning after I left home, my son Joshua had a fever convulsion and passed out.   Zane called 911 and believing Josh wasn't breathing, gave him mouth to mouth until his breathing stabilized.     Josh is okay now, but he has a severe inner ear infection.      The emt's sent Zane to our pediatricians office, where they immediately examined Josh and did blood work.     His white blood count is extremely elevated, which apparently is normal after the trauma of a seizure after such a fever spike.    They are home now, but my husband is quite shaken and so am I.    I'm not really up to discussing this today.

To make a long story short, I plan to catch the 2:30 p.m. bus home today.    I will be back in tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. and at full speed.   I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

WINE BAR AT CHRISTOPHER'S
For all of you who have visited over the past several weeks: 
Thank you for making this such a fabulous success!!!
If you have not yet visited the Wine Bar on Friday, here are some details:
We offer 45 wines by the glass to include reds, whites, sparkling wines & after dinner wines, too.
Our amazingly talented Chef prepares 5 new menu items each week.
In addition to the wines by the glass list, you may choose ANY wine in the store 
to enjoy with your foods or friends.
BEST PART???
Retail prices for all wines, NOT restaurant prices!!!
Our wines by the glass range from $4 to $15 &
Our Chef's specials range from $10 to $22.
No reservations are needed.
Get here early for the best seats.
Time: 6-10 PM Friday nights
Location: here at Christopher's 
YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS OUT, IT IS A BLAST!!!
I have recently re-released some highly rated wines.  The following wines were reviewed by Parker in recent issues of his publication, THE WINE ADVOCATE.  Scores and availability are listed.  Call us as soon as you decide, these will move very fast:
Parker on the 1996 wines from Piedmont:
        "1996 has turned out to be a classic vintage along the lines as such years as 1989, 1978 & 1971.  Concentrated, long-lived, majestic wines that are firm and closed in their youth but blossom beautifully with aging are the rule when it comes to 1996 Barbaresco and Barolo." 
Brovia 1996 Barolo "Ca Mia" single vineyard Barolo $80 each (6 bottles available) 

And, from issue #119 of Parker's Wine Advocate: 
Abadia Retuerta 1996 Cuvee Palomar (from Spain, a blend of 50% Tempranillo & 50% Cabernet)  

                92+ points, $52 each, 9 bottles available 
Abadia Retuerta 1996 Cuvee Campanario (from Spain, 100%  Tempranillo) 

                93+ points, $58 each, 3 bottles available 
Remirez de Ganuza Rioja Old Vines Unfiltered (from Spain, mostly Tempranillo) 

                92 points, $62.50 each, 6 bottles available
As a quick note, I would like to add that I have been stashing some very amazing wines in our extremely cold storage area here at Christopher's since I opened.  Now that these wines are approaching their optimum drinking windows, I thought it a good time to begin showing them to all of you.  Thanks to the ratings by Parker, though, the wines I will be offering on this basis are very limited.  So please call me soon if you would like to partake of these well-cellared, highly rated wines.
That's it for this week.  We look forward to seeing all of you soon.
For more details on our weekly events, including Saturdays, please visit us at www.christopherswine. com Your friend in wine,
Christopher

Lech:

I will ask the attorneys to forward you their initial draft of the Master Netting Agreement and then to send you the final draft.

I will fax you a copy of the final BP Amoco agreement, together with the states of incorporation for each of the BP entities.

Let me know if you need anything else.

It might be easiest if you would send me the agreements related to the UCC

I hope this email gets through to you this time.   Rather than the Nov 1st or 2nd dates I list below, perhaps we can shoot for Nov. 19, 20,21 or Nov. 26 or 27th.   Hopefully, your legal group and my legal group can execute the NDA by those dates.    I will have a better answer for you regarding the structures of Enron's LJM and Chewco investment vehicles as soon as possible.  Please contact me with any concerns or questions.  Thanks again.

Subject:	EnronOnLine Demonstration & Meeting

Steve,
It was good speaking with you this morning.   I would like to cover a few housekeeper issues and to plan for our next meeting and the EnronOnLine (EOL) demonstation. 
Non-Disclosure Agreement
The demonstration will show you how the Market Manager programs work, the different behind-the-scenes administrative and data modules, and the screens a trader would use to load and trade on the system.    In order to show these proprietary functions and screens, my management is requiring third parties to sign a confidentiality agreement.   I have attached this agreement.   Please have your legal team review it and direct questions to Tana Jones, paralegal, at 713-853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, legal counsel, at 713-345-8897. 

Suggested Day and Time for the Meeting & Demonstration
How is November 1st or 2nd ?   What days are good for you and your team?

Format of the Demonstration
We can provide various ways to demonstrate EOL and its applications.  The simpliest way may be for HETCO to provide us with one or two desktops or laptops in order to view a remote, internet, demonstration from Houston, which would also feature an open phone line to my demo-team in Houston.  In this way, HETCO and Enron get a live demonstration of the EOL system, but avoid the IT headaches of opening up the necessary internet port and setting aside the required IP addresses, which are necessary if Enron were to bring its own laptops and projectors.   I can work with someone from your IT department to work out these details.
Thanks again for this opportunity.   Please reply or call me with any questions.     I look forward to our next meeting.

Johan, Steve:

I enjoyed our conference call earlier today.  Thank you for describing your eCommerce strategies to me; it sounds like Anglo Platinum may be interested in using eCommerce tools to reach new markets for its products.  I look forward to showing you in greater detail how Enron Net Works' applications and tools may help you in this important effort.

To move our discussions forward, here are two items I promised to send you during the call:

I have secured a guest ID for you on our principal-based eMarketplace, www.enrononline.com.  When you get a moment, please log in to the system by visiting the site and using login "BSP45498" and password "AngloPlat" (both are case sensitive).  You'll be able to see our main bid/offer page as well as other content.  As a guest, you will have read-only access to the system, but this should provide you with a good overview of the site's capabilities.  Please feel free to customize the various product views and other displays as you see fit.

Also attached to this note is a draft non-disclosure agreement for your review.  Please take a look at it and let me know what you think.  If you or your attorneys have legal questions or comments on the NDA, please feel free to contact our legal person, Tana Jones, directly at tana.jones@enron.com or at her direct phone number, 1-713-853-3399.

Johan, I understand you will be traveling during the next few weeks.  I look forward to making contact with you again during the second half of October to discuss next steps in greater detail.  If at all possible, please take a quick tour of EnronOnline.com and complete the NDA in the interim so we can hit the ground running when we reconnect in a few weeks.

Thanks again for your time today, and I anticipate further productive discussions with you in the weeks ahead.

Best regards,

Mike

The analog lines are tagged right on the user end of the cord with yellow stickies with their extension numbers written on them as you'd asked. 

I'll have you the fax numbers in a couple minutes. 

I'm out of the office for a couple of hours.

Good Afternoon,

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change
signature lines?
I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the
Schedule) but not the Repo.

Notice No. 01-348
October 31, 2001


To:
All NYMEX Division Clearing Members
All NYMEX ACCESS
 Electronic Traders
All NYMEX Division Members

From:
J. Robert Collins, President

Re:
NYMEX ACCESS
 Order Entry


	NYMEX Rule 6.22, "Acceptance of Orders for Entry into NYMEX
ACCESS
," specifies the requirements for placement of orders into the
ACCESS
  system for all commodities (NYMEX and COMEX Divisions).  A copy of
the Rule is attached.  Section (C) of this Rule, "Acceptance of Orders From
Customers," specifically outlines the data necessary for input/placement of
orders, while Section (D), "Order Recordation," sets forth the procedures
for handling customer orders.

	All electronic traders are required to enter the correct account
number and clearing member number for all transactions with the exception of
multiple accounts.  NYMEX Rule 6.22(E), "Special Requirements," governs the
use of the "999" designation as it relates exclusively to multiple accounts.
Compliance Staff has additionally allowed for use of the "999" or common
holding account to be used on an "intra-session" basis for any account which
had not been set up prior to or during the ACCESS
 session in progress.  Use
of the "999" or common holding account may only be engaged on a one-time
basis for any account.  Thus, if "999" is designated three times in one
session related to three separate accounts for first time use of ACCESS
,
the "999" may never be subsequently designated for purposes of placing
orders for any of the three accounts.  Any misuse of the "999" or common
holding account would constitute a violation of Rule 6.22(C).

	The ACCESS
 System has enhanced functionality regarding the input
and storage of frequently used account numbers.  Electronic trading or
clearing member firms should contact the NYMEX Customer Service Center (the
"NCSC") with any questions at (800) 438-8616.

	Any questions regarding the rule requirements cited above should be
directed to Thomas LaSala, Vice President, Compliance, at (212) 299-2897, or
David Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice Surveillance, at (212)
299-2857.

Rule 6.22. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR ENTRY INTO NYMEX ACCESS


 (A) DEFINITIONS-for purposes of these Rules, the following words shall have
the following definitions:

(1) "Matching System"-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that accept,
match and report executions of orders in NYMEX ACCESS
.

(2) "Strategy Pad"-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that may be used
by Electronic Traders and NYMEX ACCESS
 Operators to store orders, trading
strategies and other information, but that do not accept, match or report
execution of orders into the Matching System.

(B) No Clearing Member shall assign an account number that would accept the
entry of orders into NYMEX ACCESS
 for, or on behalf of, a customer, unless
such customer is first provided with an Electronic Trading and Order Routing
Systems Disclosure Statement in a form approved by the Exchange.

(C) ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS-No person or entity may accept an
order for execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 unless the following information is
received:

(1)   Commodity;

(2) Contract Month;

(3) Purchase or Sale;

(4) Customer Account Number (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(5) Quantity;

(6) Limit Price (except for stop, market discretion, MIT or market orders);

(7) Clearing Member (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(8) Strike prices, put or call (for options); and

(9) Any precondition for entry into the Matching System (i.e., stop, market
discretion, MIT, stop limit).

(D) ORDER RECORDATION-Immediately upon receipt, all customer orders for
execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 must be (1) entered into the Matching System or
Strategy Pad or, if such orders cannot be entered into the Matching System
or Strategy Pad within one minute of receipt, they must be (2) recorded
within one minute of receipt in non-erasable ink and time-stamped in
accordance with Rule 6.18, and entered into the Matching System or Strategy
Pad as soon as practicable.


(E) SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

(1)   For any order known to be an order for multiple accounts to be
allocated after execution, the Electronic Trader's Account Number followed
by the suffix "999" shall be entered in satisfaction of subsection (B)(4) of
this Rule.  Only a person with trading discretion over multiple accounts may
place an order with a Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS

Operator to be allocated after execution. No Member Firm, Electronic Trader
or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator may accept an order for allocation after execution
unless the Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator or their
employer has on file a prior, written procedure for the systematic and
non-preferential allocation of executions among accounts. The customer's
actual Clearing Member and Customer Account Number must be provided no later
than 8:30 a.m. following the NYMEX ACCESS
 trading session in which the
transaction was executed.

(2) No person may knowingly record false account number information in
connection with any NYMEX ACCESS
 order.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed, all orders received for execution on NYMEX
ACCESS
 shall be deemed to be cancelled if not executed during the trading
session for which they were received.

FYI -
 
I just did a full contract assignment.  Both of these counterparties were in EOL. I updated EOL by removing the contract number from Merchant Energy and putting that contract number on TransAlta.   (I did notice on TransAlta Energy that there was a contract number 95001154 in some of the financial categories.  95001154 is not a financial contract and it should not have been in any of the financial categories.) 
 
 
New CP:  TransAlta Energy Marketing (U.S.) Inc. (cp #62413) (k #96019306)
 
Old CP:  Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. (cp #59152) (k #96019306)
 
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Subject:	Master Netting Agreement- AEP Companies

We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.  ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.  We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.  I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.  Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.

Much thanks!

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements Reminder

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

Kim -

Please provide me with the full name and address for Experian.  Also, we can forward the agreement on your behalf if you provide us with an e-mail address and contact name.  Finally, please give me some indication of the exact nature of the discussions, if there is any need to make the NDA specific vs. general.

If you provide these items today, we should be able to get our language out later this afternoon, tomorrow moring at the latest.

Mark

I have started discussions with Experian, likely to result in Experian becoming Enron's #2 provider of credit scoring data.  I need to get an NDA in place with Experian ASAP to cover sensitive items likely to be covered during our negotiations.  I would like to get our NDA language to them today.  Please advise as to how to proceed...

Tana,

Attached you will find the comments on the NDA from BoozAllen Hamilton.  Any chance we could get this spun back to them today?  

I provided you with the wrong email address for Eduardo yesterday -- the correct address is:

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Sharon - I need your assistance with respect to the registrations that we have to do in respect of the PG&E Master Netting Agreement.  In this regard would look up the address for PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation as such address is set out in the notice provisions of our gas master with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.

Also, could you do the same for CEG Energy Options Inc., PG&E Energy Trading - Power L.P. and PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If we do not have masters in place, look in other executed agreements, and if no agreements are executed please look in recent drafts of unexecuted agreements (and note that the address is from an unexecuted draft).

If you have any questions please call or email.

Thanks
CJG

I have attached the marked draft of the Enron Corp. guarantee reflecting the changes requested by Philip Levy.  Most of the changes are simply definitional in nature.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Tana -

I spoke to Joe Wright at APB this morning.  Here is the rub on this matter:

 - APB has a $500K LC outstanding to cover the US trading
 - Norwegin Energy Brokers - AS is a brokerage house trading in Nordic/EU areas (mostly in Scandinavian countries)
 - First Energy Brokers - AS was formed by NEB for purposes of trading in the Netherlands (not sure of the timing)
 - NEB owns a large stake in FEB, but not all of the entity.
 - APB is currently a 23% owner of NEB (thus indirectly owning a piece of FEB)
 - APB is looking to purchase the balance of the ownership of NEB which is CONFIDENTIAL (seeking to close sometime later this month)
 - Joe indicated his thought that, post-NEB purchase, there is a good chance that NEB and FEB will be merged
 - Joe also indicated that it would not be a problem for the APB LC to be expanded to these entities - if this is what credit would need.

I do not know if we have any history with either NEB or FEB, but I am sure we need to talk to credit to figure out what is needed in order for the trading to take place.  Can you follow this up or do you want me to do so?

Thanks.

Mark

Please provide me with the necessary information on the company (e.g., contact name, address, etc.).  I'll make sure that we get the confidentiality agreement moving forward.

Please provide me with a brief description of the project or work that is going to be discussed with VMAC and a contact name/e-mail address.  We will do the necessary conflict check and send the agreement to VMAC directly.

Thanks.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual."   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the "International Travel" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

Importance:	High

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Jay:

Please add AEP to your list of counterparties for master netting agreements.  If at all possible, can you provide us with the names of all related entities and contracts for those counterparties we gave you awhile ago as soon as possible so that we can begin pulling contracts?

Thanks!

Tana - - 

Are there changes to the managers for the above entity?  Current managers are Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley; with many business units removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule, I did not know if your entities would be subject to the same.

Please let me know.  Thanks.

The Counterparty system indicates that this counterparty was suspended on 3/15/01.  Cheryl Johnson's (Counterparty Group) comments state:  
 
"Spoke to Bill Bergner who states that he has sent documentation to legal regarding the conversion.  He said they did business under a group of different entities other than "Inc."  In Jan. '99, they combined those entities to form the LLC, so it wasn't a simple conversion per se.  He also stated that this entity should be deleted (inactivated), as there will be no business conducted in that name.  This record will be suspended pending inactivation."
 
Does anyone in legal know anything about this because we do have an active contract in the contract system?
 
This is part of the contract audit I've been working on.

Notice No. 01-372
November 2, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was
73,364 natural gas futures contracts.

Gentlemen -

I have attached an updated NDA for SunGard.  I added a comment to both the NDA and the Schedule relating to continuing obligations of confidentiality in the event the work SunGard is performing is not extended beyond the initial 5 days.

The attached is, therefore, the most current version.  

In light of our agreement that a new NDA should be put in place, I am proposing that this version be forwarded to Mr. Bonner and/or Mr. Popp for review by SunGard.  I will also try to contact Mr. Bonner again to see if there is a local address to which I can forward this for review.  Unless any of you should have any further comments or questions, I will be forwarding this version later this morning.

Mark

Notice No. 01-386
November 20, 2001


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the December 2001 options contract for Copper (HXZ1)
and Aluminum (OAZ1) is Tuesday, November 27, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the recently
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the December 2001 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on November 27, 2001.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, November 27, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Tuesday's submissions and processing will be
available on Wednesday morning November 28, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Do we have any agreements with a company called Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation?  CommodityLogic is looking at entering into a confidentiality agreement with this company.

Thanks.

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical "(including automatic termination, if applicable)" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

Subject:	Requests for NDAs

In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the Enron Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:

1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones
2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address
3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer
4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.
5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.
6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.

Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.

Tana -

Do we have anything on this entity that is in the pipeline?  I do not have anything on this.  

If you do not, I wonder if it is another one that Dan Hyval was handling prior to his departure?

Douglas County has been trying to get signed up with EOL for over a month.  From what the Help Desk is telling me, they believe its sitting with legal at this point.  Can you please assist us in getting their paperwork finished?

If significant revisions are made in negotiation, at a minimum run your drafts to Rick Antonoff at Cadwalader.  Cadwalader is acting as gatekeeper for consistency purposes, as well as helping with the issues.

Hello,

As you know, Genia underwent surgery this morning and she came through with flying colors.     The surgery lasted approximately 2 hours and the procedure went with no complications.     She is in recovery.   Thanks.

Please forward to those who may be interested.

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!! 

:)  

Diane

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :		Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Tana,

Could you please provide me with an NDA that will cover discussions regarding the sale of DealBench.  This NDA would be similar to those that you put together for DealBench, PurchasePro and Thomsen Financial.  I would like to get a draft of this on Monday please.  I know that you usually email NDAs directly to the company, but I want to take a different approach on this one.  I have a meeting the CEO on Tuesday in which we will not discuss confidential info (just high level discussions).  If that meeting goes well, I want to have the NDA ready to go so we can move to the next stage of discussions quickly.  Please let me know if you need any other information besides the following:

James W. Pritchett, CEO
Petris Technology, Inc.
1900 St. James Place, Seventh Floor
Houston, TX. 77057

Thanks,
Ross

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Just checking on my customers in the Pa Database and saw that Credit approved this Sabic Americas, Inc. 10/5, but that Status still says Credit Reviewing- just wanted to make sure this one didn't get stuck and moves on through to legal....
Please let me know, as I have a meeting scheduled with this customer on October 17 and would like to be able to show him the system with his permanent ID.

Thanks,
Jen McQuade

Mark --

This looks fine to me.  I believe that Henry Bonner of SunGard is travelling tonight and will be in Houston tomorrow.  He left a message saying that he will call with the hotel fax number when he gets to his destination.  I will forward that information as soon as I receive it so that we can get the NDA  and signed letter to him.  Henry's cell phone number is 917 373 5844 (Cell).  Thanks.

-- Rex

Rex/Mark -

As we discussed, I am not confident that the Automated Securities Clearance NDA sufficiently covers us in this new matter.  I have called Henry Bonner at SunGard to verify the legal structure to see if we can or cannot use it; however, he has yet to return my call.

I have prepared the attached based upon a belief that we should have in place an NDA specifically with SunGard Trading & Risk Systems.  Because we also want to move this matter forward, I have attached to the agreement a "Schedule A" in which I have outlined the work that SunGard will be performing for us - at least at the onset.  If we go beyond the first five days of this work, we should definitely have a formal consulting agreement signed to ensure we have a clear path forward on the work to be done and deliverables to be provided.

In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know if this works.

Thanks.

mark

Various discussions took place Friday afternoon as to advisability of inserting a provision designed to bind (or at least make an attempt to bind ) current Counterparty Guarantors to obligations under the Adoption Agreement/ERMT Master Agreements.  

A quick fix that "hopefully" does not significantly disrupt the work you may have already done on your Adoption Agreements is to insert the language contained in the attached document just below the signature lines of all Adoption Agreements, only in those cases where the Master being adopted is currently supported by a guaranty issued by Counterparty's parent or other credit support provider/guarantor.  The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory, but please call me with any questions.

If you see problems with the specific language (not the idea) of the Addendum, please call me ASAP. 

Thanks for your understanding and assistance,

Steve

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue?

It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.

This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.

Attached is the file containing the final agreement between ENW and Energy Argus enabling EOL to publish certain Energy Argus publications on the website.  We need to have this agreement signed by ENW and forwarded to Energy Argus for counter-signature.

Mark,

Thanks for the response.

A couple of notes:
we somehow want to incorporate that Chisholm will not solicit or work with another front end software vendor until after February 2001 (as that is when they will be ready to begin).
we have discussed pricing with Chisholm and would like to include as an attachment the following spreadsheet so that they know we are willing to tier the proposed pricing.

 << File: Chisholm Pricing.xls >> 
I made some comments within the document, we can discuss via phone if you would like.

 << File: loi-chisholm(11-08-01)_comments.doc >> 
Lastly, we want to make sure that we are not getting 'too legal' in this letter as we have established a good rapport with Chisholm and don't want to scare them off.  I hope this makes sense.

Thanks again.


Make It A Great Day!!

Attached for your review is a first draft of a proposed LOI for Chisholm.  I have added provisions that mirror the items laid out in the product description information as these are the types of things that will be addressed in the final definitive agreements.

Please review at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.

   Ray - 
   The changes made are acceptable.  I will have two originals circulated 
   internally for signature and forward them to your company for 
   counter-signature. 
   As I will be out of the office through tomorrow, it may be the end of 
   the week before you have the agreements in hand.

             Attached you'll find a clean and blackline version of the 
     revised agreement which reflects changes resulting from your items 
     1,2,3 and 5 below.  The intent behind not changing item 4 is that if 
     Enron were to use the software in one of the identified "dangerous or 
     hazardous" uses Enron would be on it's own.  If you have any further 
     questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me at 978

     Subject: RE: Quallaby / Evaluation Agreement 
     Ray - 
     Thanks for the response and the black line.  Below are my additional 
     comments: 
     1.  The reference to "Hardware Products" needs to be deleted, as does 
     the 
     Schedule B.  It is my understanding that the hardware is provided by a 
     different vendor.  If it is necessary to reference the hardware as a 
     requirement for running the software programs, this should be listed 
     in 
     Schedule A as a specification. 
     2.  Paragraph 2.1 - the term "its best efforts" should be replaced 
     with 
     "reasonable efforts" and, if it is Quallaby's position that Enron 
     pursue 
     confidential treatment of the information, despite legal requirements 
     to 
     disclosed placed on Enron, the reasonable cost for pursuing this 
     protection 
     should be borne by Quallaby. 
     3.  Paragraph 3.2 - the change made at the end of the paragraph needs 
     to 
     read "... BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
     THE 
     INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.1(a) AND 3.1(b) ABOVE."  Since 
     neither 
     of the referenced provisions are, themselves, warranties, it is 
     incorrect 
     to reference them in 3.2 as being warranties. 
     4.  Paragraph 3.3 - the following language should be inserted after 
     the 
     word "applications" - "save and except for any indemnity obligations 
     of 
     Quallaby set forth in Section 3.1 above."  By not having this 
     reference, it 
     is possible that section 3.3 could be read to negate Quallaby's 
     obligations 
     as set out in Section 3.1. 
     5.  In Section 5 of the Agreement - a new paragraph should be added as 
     paragraph 5.9 to indicate as follows:  "The provisions of Sections 2, 
     3 and 
     4 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement." 
     This is 
     more so important now that Quallaby has included specific provisions 
     enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an 
     infringement 
     claim. 
     With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the 
     agreement, 
     we are prepared to move this matter forward. 
     Thanks for your continued assistance and cooperation. 
     Mark

If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

Diamond-san,

As I wrote in the past, Nissho Iwai's LNG related department
has been transferred into a new joint venture company between
Nissho and Sumitomo Corp. as of October 1, 2001, namely,
 "LNG Japan Corp.".

In this connection, we would like to conclude another NDA with
LNG Japan Corp, as per attached.

Please review it and it would be great if you could make original again
and send us for Mr.Miyazawa's signature.

Also, please advise us how we should treat Nissho's NDA in these
circumstances.

BTW, I talked with Mr.Matsubara, Manager of Enron Global Finance in Tokyo.
We are internally discussing when we start our official meeting.
Please let us know when you are ready.

Regards,

LNG Japan Corporation

Good morning wine lovers,
Some of you may remember the sampler case from several weeks ago that contained a couple of wines from the following producer.  The Malbec that was featured generated such a positive response that I decided to try the entire line-up from this highly rated yet small production winery from Argentina.  One taste of this group and I knew we had a winner!!!  Without letting the importer know just how much I loved these wines, I began to negotiate the prices in hopes of offering a case of 12 to all of you for a price that could not be matched.  The final pricing was so good that I bought dozens of cases of each wine.  To give you an idea of what I am talking about, the Reservas from this winery normally run about $18.50 each, while the regular bottlings run in the neighborhood of $15.  The normal case price, therefore would hit a price tag of more than $200!!!  Wait until you see what kind of magic I performed on these fabulous wines:

SERIOUS South American Value Sampler (2 btls each):  
Finca Flichman Cabernet Mendoza Argentina 1999 (full bodied, concentrated fruit) 87 points  
Finca Flichman Malbec Mendoza Argentina 1998 (intense color, maximum Malbec expression) 87 points  
Finca Flichman Syrah Mendoza Argentina 1999 (vigorous raspberry, well structured & tannic) 88 points  
Finca Flichman Cabernet RESERVA 1997 (numerous awards as one of Argentina's best) 88 points  
Finca Flichman Malbec RESERVA 1999 (serious complexity, plum, soft tannin, amazing finish) 89 points  
Finca Flichman Syrah RESERVA 1998 (black in color, spicy, jammy, quite passionate style) 90 points  

As I stated above, this case of wine could run over $200 without my negotiating skills.
THIS WEEK ONLY, STEAL A FEW CASES FOR ONLY $143 PLUS TAX EACH.
Buy now, thank me later.  Call us soon at 713-524-9144 to be certain that we don't run out.  We will be happy to hold your case(s) until you come by.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

If the underlying master does not already have triangular set off, why wouldn't we go ahead and put it in the adoption agreement ?  So long as the definition of Affiliates is sufficiently limited, wouldn't triangular be preferable?

Importance:	High

The meeting scheduled for 11:00 has been cancelled.  Time would be better spent on document review and Adoption Agreement preparation.  As to document distribution, Tana has informed that Masters are being pulled and are starting to be sent to you at this moment.  

Some of you may know that Marcus has been proceeding without physical documents by accessing Masters through Live Link.  Deb Korkmas is pursuing the obtaining of access to that database for Anne, Travis, Elizabeth and Jeff, as they have the bulk of the documents to review.  If others of you wish to have Live Link access, please call Deb.

For clarification purposes,  the Set Off provision that we are trying to adopt is merely 2 party set off; not triangular or square.  The sample clause in Travis' Adoption Agreement for Power accomplishes such goal.  Please call me if you have any confusion over which Template to use.

Jeff,  I will have the Gas Adoption Agreement to you for review before 11:00.

Please funnel any questions, problems, issues, etc. to me as they arise.  If I don't know the answer, I'll get it for you.

Steve

Notice No.:  01-445
December 27, 2001


NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS A MODIFIED
PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM


At its meeting on December 27, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined
to extend, with certain modifications, the current Proprietary Fee Reduction
Program ("Program") through December 2002.

Effective trade date January 2, 2002, Member Firms and individual members
who own seats will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 6 cents per
round turn (3 cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 1.25 cents per
round turn (.625 cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should NOT adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments directly
to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact M. Dawn
Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Is there a chance that the one amendment referring to gas was executed and the other one referring to energy/power for some reason did not get executed?

Remember that the power and gas amendments look on their face to be identical documents, and you have to read very closely to see that they are indeed different.  Are we sure that we are not looking at 2 different docs--a gas one and a power one--and concluding that they are the same and therefore that we are missing one?

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.

Subject:	Bidder Rooms

We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone
              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.


           I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.

Notice Number: 01-391
November 21, 2001

TO:
ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants


As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center and the inaccessibility
of the precious metals stored at ScotiaMocatta Depository ("SMD"), an
Exchange Licensed Depository, located in Four World Trade Center ("4WTC"),
the NYMEX Board of Directors implemented emergency rules pertaining to the
warrants issued by SMD.  In summary, these emergency rules permitted an
individual or firm taking delivery the option to reject a warrant for metal
on deposit at the SMD vault at 4WTC.

SMD has successfully relocated, using an Exchange Approved Carrier, all of
the precious metals stored at 4WTC to an SMD custodial account at the
Brink's Inc Exchange Licensed Depository and has applied to the Exchange to
establish a new Licensed Depository in New York City.

Therefore, the Exchange has, effectively immediately, rescinded the
emergency rules pertaining to the warrants issued by SMD.  As a result, the
Exchange Rules relating to warrants are those which were in effect prior to
the declaration of the emergency.

Prior to the establishment of its new facility as an Exchange-licensed
depository, SMD will offer its clients the options of leaving the metal in
storage; selling it to SMD; exchanging depository receipts for those of
another Exchange-licensed depository acceptable to ScotiaMocatta, with any
ounce differential cash-settled on the basis of a published price determined
by SMD; or delivering replacement metal to a mutually agreeable location, in
exchange for the metal at the ScotiaMocatta depository, subject to payment
by the client of the current price differential, as quoted by SMD.

Should you have any questions please contact Thomas LaSala at 212-299-2897,
Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.

Do we have anything on this entity that is in the pipeline?  I do not have anything on this.  

If you do not, I wonder if it is another one that Dan Hyval was handling prior to his departure?

Notice No. 01-411

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Yesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-411, which
summarized a new large order execution (LOX) that begins today in the first
two months of the natural gas futures contract.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				NEW NYMEX RULE 6.58

Rule 6.58.	LARGE LOT TRADING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS (PILOT PROGAM)

A Floor Member may buy or sell a large lot quantity of futures contracts at
or above the minimum amount specified below at a single price on an all or
none basis, provided that each such transaction is conducted on the Exchange
trading floor in accordance with the large order execution ("LOX")
procedures specified in this rule.

(A) Eligible Futures Contract and Minimum LOX Transaction Size.  LOX
transactions may be effected only for transactions in the following NYMEX
Division futures contracts and for no less than the following minimum LOX
transaction quantities:

			Futures Contract 		Contract Months
Minimum LOX Transaction Size

			Natural Gas			1st and 2nd nearby
250
	(Six-Month Pilot Program)

(B) Eligible Orders.  A member may not execute any order by means of a LOX
transaction unless the LOX bid or Offer price is the best price available to
satisfy the terms of the order or unless the order includes specific
instructions to execute a LOX transaction.

(C) Request for Quote.  To make a request for quote (RFQ) for a LOX
transaction, an initiating Floor Member (Initiating Member) will announce an
interest in executing a LOX transaction either by requesting a LOX Bid or
Offer or both, from a specified location in the ring.  In addition, the
Initiating Member must specify to the ring the total quantity and contract
month of the RFQ.  All terms of the RFQ including the identity of the
Initiating Member will be recorded by the LOX Book Holder (LBH).  In any
case that a LOX RFQ results in a response deemed by the LBH to be
reasonable, the Initiating Member will incur RFQ fees, regardless of whether
or not that Floor Member executes a trade.

There shall be only one active RFQ for a contract month at a time.

The maximum quantity allowed for a LOX RFQ is 5,000 contracts.

(D) Bids and Offers in Response to a LOX RFQ. Any Floor Member that has bid
and/or offered the best price in response to the LOX RFQ for the full
quantity stated in the LOX RFQ and has been recognized by the LBH as making
a reasonable bid or offer will be the Initial Respondent.  Any Floor Member
responding to a LOX RFQ must indicate that the responding LOX bid or LOX
offer is in response to such RFQ (LOX Bid or Offer).  Once a LOX Bid and/or
Offer has been made and deemed by the LBH to be an acceptable bid and/or
offer, such bid or offer will be recorded by the LBH and will be active for
30 seconds from the time it has been recognized by the LBH or until it has
been expressly withdrawn, with acknowledgement from the LBH, by the Floor
Member making such bid or offer.  All LOX bids and offers must be quoted in
half cent or full cent increments.

(1) LOX Bids and Offers Outside Non-LOX Spread. A LOX Bid (Offer) may be at
or above (below) the instant bid (offer) for non-LOX trading being bid or
offered in the ring for that futures contract month.

(2) Aggregation of Orders by Brokers. Floor Members acting as brokers may
bundle limit orders to bid and/or offer in response to the LOX RFQ.  If the
total of the orders is less than the requested amount, the responding broker
can trade for his own account or an account which he controls, the
difference between the requested amount and the total of the orders.  In the
event that a broker bundles limit orders in connection with a LOX execution,
all bundled limited orders must receive the LOX execution price.

(3) Aggregation by Floor Members Trading for Proprietary Accounts.  In
response to a LOX RFQ, Floor Members trading for their proprietary accounts
may join together in bidding and/or offering for the full quantity of the
LOX RFQ.  Such proprietary accounts either may be a personal account in the
case of an individual member or a house proprietary account in the case of a
Member Firm or Clearing Member with a representative on the Trading Floor.

(4) Secondary Trading Right for Proprietary Accounts.  In response to a LOX
RFQ, only a Floor Member trading for his proprietary account, or for
proprietary accounts joined together as per section (D)(3) of this rule, may
bid and/or offer for a portion of the LOX RFQ, provided, however, that such
quantity bid and/or offered must be for an amount no less than the Minimum
LOX Transaction Size and that such bid and/or offer can only be submitted if
an Initial Respondent has been identified by the LBH and that Initial
Respondent is a Floor Member acting as a broker.  This right will be known
as a Secondary Trading Right.

In order to exercise the Secondary Trading Right, each Member must state
his/her intentions to the LBH.  For purposes of the Secondary Trading Right,
Floor Members trading for their proprietary trading accounts may exercise
this right by joining a bid or offer at any time prior to execution of the
LOX transaction and will be entitled to an aggregate amount of up to 50% of
the quantity stated in the RFQ.

When a Floor Member combines customer orders with proprietary business and
is recognized as the Initial Respondent, any reduction in the ultimate
allocation that results from an exercise of a Secondary Trading Right will
result in fills first allocated to the customer(s) with any remainder to the
Floor Member.  In addition, if, as the result of such an exercise, a broker
does not have a quantity sufficient to fill each of the orders that were
aggregated, the broker shall allocate fills according to the following
requirements:

a)	the fills shall be allocated pursuant to a predetermined allocation
methodology made available to the customers prior to the execution;
b)	the allocation shall be made as soon as practicable after the
transaction is executed;
c)	the allocation shall be fair and equitable and no account or group
of accounts may receive consistently favorable or unfavorable treatment;
d)	the allocation methodology shall be sufficiently objective and
specific so that it can verified for any given trade; and
e)	the allocation methodology must be consistently applied.

Floor Members may not exercise a Secondary Trading Right if such Floor
Member is the Initial Respondent acting as a broker.


(5) Trading Priority.  Any Floor Member who becomes the Initial Respondent
willing to trade the full quantity stated in the LOX RFQ at the ultimate
best bid and, or best offer will have a right of trading priority which will
entitle him to the full quantity stated in the RFQ, except in the case when
a Secondary Trading Right is exercised.


(E) LOX Execution.
1.  Time Limit Restriction. Once an Initial Respondent has been recognized
by the LBH, only the Initiating Member requesting the LOX RFQ, may hit such
LOX Bid or Offer (or both) and must do so within 30 seconds of LBH
recognition of the Initial Respondent subject to the following conditions:

2.	Exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.   If one or more Floor Members
exercises the Secondary Trading Rights provided by this rule, the LBH will
enforce such rights in the following manner:

Each Floor Member responding to the LOX RFQ (either as an Initial Respondent
or in exercise of a Secondary Trading Right) shall receive an allocation
equal to a weighted proportion based on the number of contracts bid or
offered by such Member as a percentage of the total quantity of all
contracts bid or offered in response to the LOX RFQ, as the case may be, at
the price accepted by the Initiating Member, provided,  however,

If, as a result of the allocation specified above, an Initial Respondent
acting as a broker would receive less than 50% of the total quantity, then
the LBH instead shall allocate no less than 50% of the total quantity to
such Initial Respondent with the remainder allocated to those exercising
their Secondary Trading Rights based on  the number of contracts bid or
offered by each such Floor Member as a percentage of all contracts bid or
offered pursuant to the exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.

Following execution of the LOX transaction, the LBH will confirm the parties
to the transaction and the quantity allocated to each respondent.

(F) Responsibility for LOX Orders.  A Floor Member shall not be liable for
failure to execute an order as a LOX order unless such order was designated
by the customer as a LOX order.

(G) Impact on Non-LOX Orders.  In no event shall a LOX order elect stop
loss, market-if-touched or other contingency orders, or otherwise affect
orders in the regular non-LOX market.

(H) Closing Period and Post-Close Prohibition.  LOX transactions will
neither be allowed during the closing period nor during the post-close
session for applicable contracts.

Thanks for your help with the Russian NDAs! 
They did sign them, and even then we didn't show them anything crucial, so I think we're covered.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

A US Power Spread Transaction (as defined below) with Enron Power Marketing=
, Inc. under which the Seller (the "Spread Seller") and the Buyer (the "Spr=
ead Buyer") shall enter into two physical power transactions, under which e=
ither (A) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from E=
nron, Counterparty shall buy the First Product and sell the Second Product,=
 each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Qu=
antity at the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the "Firm (LD)=
" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Pu=
rchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00), including, withou=
t limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything=
 to the contrary in the master agreement, if any, that governs these Transa=
ctions ("Firm (LD) Energy"); or (B) for the case in which Counterparty subm=
its an offer to sell to Enron, Counterparty shall sell the First Product an=
d buy the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) ener=
gy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price.
The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each Del=
ivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2001 to the Termination Date 31 Oct=
 2001.
The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description wil=
l be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the seco=
nd product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction i=
f both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price i=
f only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the Fir=
st Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, =
modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website.
The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the E=
RCOT N 2001Transaction.  The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that =
the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as =
separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such tran=
sactions.  Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the =
ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under th=
e ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.  However, unless =
otherwise expressly defined, the term "transaction" as used on the Website =
shall mean each of the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction. =
 The ERCOT Transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points w=
ithin the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") at Seller's=
 daily election. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertine=
nt ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ER=
COT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined=
 in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.  The ERCOT N 2001 tran=
saction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North=
 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Ele=
ctric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") Board of Directors, at S=
eller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or =
zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unles=
s otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within t=
he geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zon=
e.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT sche=
duling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmiss=
ion Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT=
 Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Con=
tractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hou=
rs (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicab=
le hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').

Lorie -

Please see the attached version of the LOI.  I have added a paragraph - paragraph 6 - as a non-solicitation provision.  Be aware that these usually are negotiated to be mutual and, in that event, I will be required to obtain approval of a mutual provision at three different levels, including Corp.  This is current policy within the company to ensure we do not bind other divisions or groups to a non-solicit that we cannot comply with.

Let me know your thoughts.

Mark

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.  Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Tana/Mark,
Columbia Gulf has requested the following changes to their NDA. The legal entity name should read "Columbia Gulf Transmission Company."  They would also like to add point number 9 which states, " The execution of this agreement relative to confidential information does not obligate either party to enter into any other agreement or any transaction as that term is referenced herein."

As long as you don't have any issues with the changes, please forward a copy to Jim Hart at Columbia.  They are scheduled to come over for a demo next week.

Thanks,

Dan

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Tana,


Comsys requires the same NDA as Michael Bridges has been using for companies like Deloitte and Touche, etc.

Thank you.

Tanya/Jay,
I am forwarding to you documentation from Westport Resources Corporation regarding the merger with Belco Oil & Gas.  As you know, we have existing financial agreements with both companies, as identified below:

Belco Oil & Gas - Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated July 8, 1999, which has unlimited credit
Westport Oil & Gas Company, Inc. - ISDA Master Agreement dated March 17, 1998

The Counterparty wants to retain the Belco Master.  Please let me know what Credit wants to do.

Stephanie

Tana,
I received a PA for Straightline (Division of U.S. Steel) and credit approved.  I ask Global to create an CP ID.  and the ID reads.  Straightline, a dba of US Steel Corporation.  Do I have to ask customer to re-fax PA with GCP name, CP ID # 142509?  or is okay to process like Straightline ( Division of U.S. Steel) ?

Let me know,
Thank you,
Claudia

Paul -
 
Attached is a redlined version of the  agreement.  I have basically accepted all of Williams' comments, but felt  the agreement needed to be cleaned-up a bit.  The changes are all generic  in nature and should be easily accepted by Williams.  If this is the case,  please work with Tana Jones (x33399) to have the agreement properly initialed by  Legal before signed by Tom.  If no other changes are made, I am advising  Tana to initial this document on my behalf so that Tom can sign.
 
If you should need me tomorrow (later today) please  call me on my cell at 713-444-8234.
 
Mark

Mark,
 
Attached is the redline Beta agreement from  Williams.  Tom agreed to change the non-disclosure period to six  months.  We are trying to turn this around quickly so the users can test  InvoiceLogic beginning Friday.

 Paul,  
         I  received your last version of the contract from Gary Binney. After comparing the  document to the redline that I sent you I see that several of our suggestedc  hanges were not addressed. If you do not agree to the changes please respond  with the reasons so. I have prepared a new redline version of the document,i  ncorporating some of your changes.  Just trying to make it easy for us all  to tell what has changed from the original agreement. It would be helpful if you  when you respond you send redline comments, if possible. 
        Please review  and then respond to me with your comments. Thanks.

Anne Koehler & I had a quick call w/Doug Glass.  Thanks for his name.  We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).  And NY law.  Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.  I also heard back from Justy.

Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it!

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

Although this is definitely not the best way to announce it, today is my last day at Enron Canada Corp. and I wanted to let you know that it has been a real pleasure working with you over the last couple of years.  I apologize for letting you know by e-mail instead of giving you a call.  Unfortunately, the mechanics of my employment change required me to avoid phoning you all earlier.  

Just so you know, I am returning to my old job in the world of private practice at Bennett Jones LLP here in Calgary.  I do not have my new e-mail address or phone number yet but you can reach me at the main switchboard at (403) 298-3100 starting December 3, 2001.  My mugshot, direct line and e-mail address should be appearing on the Bennett Jones website (www.bennettjones.ca) within the next month.  In the meantime, I will be taking a couple of weeks to spend with my wife and 3 month old son Jimmy.

I wish nothing but the best for you and if you ever find yourself in the Great White North of Calgary, please give me a call.

All the best,

Mark S. Powell
Legal Counsel

Tana,

The instructions don't work, and quite frankly, I don't have the luxury of waiting for an IT guy to help me.  Is it possible for you to print out the Alcoa isda and fax it to me at the below fax number?  I need it on an urgent priority basis.  If you can't fax it to me, please let me know.

Thanks,

Limor,

The instructions below should help you find the access to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database (where the ISDA information is located).   If you want to get into where the documents are actually stored online, you need to contact Moyez Lallani, and he can get you access to Livelink.  Tell him you are in Legal in New York and you need access ASAP.  Then just have your computer guy up there set up up an Icon.

Marc -

I made the modifications to the VMAC document.  While I understand the business purpose, because we do not want EOL is not and we do not want it to be considered a clearing mechanism, we want to make sure document we prepare do not made these type of references.  As these discussions relate to the platform and the manner in which it operates, would you be comfortable with :  ... would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform."  If this works, we can implement this language and get the agreement out.

Also, if we are going to discuss anything related to specific transactions with any counterparties or, alternatively, if discussions with VMAC progress to the point where it is contemplated that counterparty information may be released, please remember that this information is confidential and cannot be released to any third party by Enron without the express written consent of the counterparty.

Tana, 


It seems like the NDA was drafted for an alternative platform. I would appreciate if you could modify "EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information a possible transaction or other business relationship involving an alternative trading platform for certain Enron transactions"  

for something along the lines of :"EnronOnline, LLC and Enron Net Works LLC (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a "Enron") and the Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation ("VMAC"), (collectively the "Parties"), would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving clearing or credit wrapping of EnronOnline transactions."

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new "Morning Briefing" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

Starting today, please route all general inquiry calls to our Business Center to provide each customer with consistent and effective assistance. The number for the Center is 800-337-7827 (800-EES-SVCS) or calls can be transferred to x59390.  You may also contact them through e-mail at EESBusinessCenter@enron.com. 

In the event that an account, partner, utility or vendor's activity affects EES' interests, an URGENT ISSUE request should be filed immediately. Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

Tana: EEL has a couple of agreements with HSBC plc but each is transaction specific.  Nothing with the New York branch to the best of my knowledge.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Thought I would check back with you to see if you have had time to address the issue (below) I had forwarded you on the 8th of this month.  I am trying to tie up loose ends on as many open name change issues as I can before I go on vacation.  Currently I am in need of copies of the Secretary of State certificates for the merger and the concurrent name change.  Belco Oil & Gas Corp has quite a bit of exposure and is on Credit Watch; with this in mind I would like to clean this merger up in the database as soon as possible. As I mentioned below, Mr Boigon will only speak to someone from our Legal Department since he feels he has sent ample documentation already.  

Please feel free to forward me a name and number if you would prefer I re-direct this inquiry.

Sincerely,

Good afternoon, I work with Cheryl Johnson in Global Counterparty doing name changes, acquisitions, and mergers and have run into a minor setback with one of the counterparties:

I received a lead from one of my co-workers that a merger and concurrent name change had occurred involving the above referenced entities.  To follow up on the lead I spoke to Howard Boigon at 303-575-0143, and I requested documentation in the form of copies of Secretary of State documents relevant to the changes.  Mr. Boigon informed me that he had forwarded a DPL Notice to you with a "complete package" detailing the transaction.  He refuses to send anything further until I get with you and find out if what he sent is sufficient; if it is not he has requested that someone from legal call him and explain what we need and why.

Could you please follow up with me on this issue...don't you just love Mondays?!

I just talked to Scott Freeman; he said his lawyer Bob Klein sent you a few minor comments a week or so ago.  Have you received these?

If not, please feel free to call Bob at 212-816-3336.

Thanks,

No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then.

Rex/Mark -

As we discussed, I am not confident that the Automated Securities Clearance NDA sufficiently covers us in this new matter.  I have called Henry Bonner at SunGard to verify the legal structure to see if we can or cannot use it; however, he has yet to return my call.

I have prepared the attached based upon a belief that we should have in place an NDA specifically with SunGard Trading & Risk Systems.  Because we also want to move this matter forward, I have attached to the agreement a "Schedule A" in which I have outlined the work that SunGard will be performing for us - at least at the onset.  If we go beyond the first five days of this work, we should definitely have a formal consulting agreement signed to ensure we have a clear path forward on the work to be done and deliverables to be provided.

In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know if this works.

Thanks.

mark

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :	Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Hi Tana

I am entering my first ISDA on the database and have a couple of questions and because the database is your baby I thought it best to ask you.

Branches: does that mean Enron branches and/or counterparty branches?
Restrictions: does that mean whether we have included for example FX and Currency provisions?

Kind regards,
Anna Fox

Leslie,

I just spoke with the gas futures trader at TEA and he would like to trade on EnronOnline, but can't due to ISDA not being in place.  
I know  they trade on behalf of others, but is there anything we can to do accommodate them, in order to migrate their gas business to EOL ?

Thanks for you assistance.

T.

Ross -

As we discussed, attached is both a redlined and clean version of the Deloitte letter.  The redlined reflects the changes we have made to our form based upon the comments submitted by Deloitte.  The clean version incorporates the changes and can be used to finalize this matter, the only thing still needing to be completed is the name and address on the letter.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark

Looks okay.  Are you going to e-mail me a clean set of docs so that I can
send them to Mahonia (we need to change all references from Sept. 27 to
Sept.28)?  The authorized signatory will apparently only be available there
in the morning.

     Subject:  Mahonia Limited


     John

     Further to our discussions I have discussed the tax situation with the
     Directors of Mahonia Limited and they have advised that:

     Mahonia Limited has taken no tax or legal advice in connection with
     the
     transaction and is not represented in the US by US council.  However,
     the
     Directors believe that Mahonia Limited is only carrying on a trade or
     business in the island of Jersey and accordingly the applicable law is
     that
     of the island of Jersey and there is no withholding tax under Jersey
     Law.

     They are happy to provide the representations detailed in Annex A to
     the
     ENAC Swap and to complete the W8-ben form on the basis of their
     understanding as described above.

     Kind regards

     Yours sincerely
     For and on behalf of
     Mourant & Co. Secretaries Limited

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Mark-

Greetings.  In light of the "Kase Commentary" on EnronOnline's yearly anniversary, we have reviewed the publication and number of viewers, and would like to end the contract we currently have with Cynthia Kase.  She has supplied EnronOnline with the weekly publication free of charge.  Our feelings have been mirrored by her; she wishes to discontinue publishing the Commentary on the website as well.  I would like to start the ball rolling and begin any documentation needed to discontinue the publication, signed and recognized by both parties.  What are the next steps to take?  Is this something you have time for or is this matter something that we should get Barbara Gray involved in?  

Regards,
Kelly Heuertz

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Hi Mark,
    There's no problem using our own NDA.  We are hoping to have our kick off meeting tomorrow morning and we'd like to have the NDA in place by then if possible.  We only have three weeks from the kick off until actual delivery of files on Nov 15.  We will need the rest of November and December for building the website and testing internally to meet  our January -pre-Analyst Meeting -launch. 

Thank you for your time. I really appreciate both your and Tana's assistance.

~Heather

Heather -

Thanks for the information.  At this time, we prefer to use our form documents.  I understand that Tana is currently working on the NDA for this company, based upon information Erica provided.  As to the form of agreement, I can probably have something by the end of the day tomorrow for 2Advanced.com to look at.  Please let me know what the "agressive" schedule is.

Thanks.

Mark

Hi Mark,
	As Erica mentioned, we are going to move forward with 2advanced.com to redo the EnronOnline website.  I will be the primary point of contact between Enron and the agency, but please cc Erica Bess as well. Here is the contract and the two-way NDA 2advanced.com sent over.  True to Enron form, we are pushing a very aggressive schedule, so please let me know if you need any other additional information or if I can be of any assistance in any way.

Hello Everyone!

Please let us know if your traders are planning on trading on EOL Thursday the 22nd, and Friday the 23rd.  Thanksgiving, of course, is an Enron holiday and Exchange holiday, however we know that the traders sometimes still trade on holidays!

Let us know the level of trading so we can prepare for coverage on our end.

Thanks,
TARA

Tana:

Would you please develop an NDA for the following prospective client:

Anglo American plc
20 Carlton House Terrace
London SW1Y 5AN 

Contact: Johan Serfontein
Phone: 27-11-373-6800

This will be for a potential private eMarketplace software license sale, similar to my other prospects.

Would you please e-mail me one this afternoon if at all possible?  I am going to send him an e-mail summarizing today's conversation and would like to include this as an attachment.  I'll have Johan get his lawyer to talk to you if they have questions.

Thanks,

Mike

Per Carol St. Clair, at this time, there is no urgency in finalizing and executing any master netting agreements.  No master netting agreement should be signed without Bill Bradford's or Louise Kitchen's prior approval.  If any questions, please contact either Carol or Elizabeth Sager.

Thanks!

Marie

All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks,

Since they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.  Tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for.

Mark - Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP is signing their ISDA Master Agreement today and would like to get online to trade with EOL asap.  According to Jennifer McQuatde, they are currently trading physicals online and, she believes, have signed all the necessary docs.  Louis Dreyfus has asked if we would turn them on to trade OTC derivatives online based upon a fax of the signature page to their ISDA.  What is your view on this, oh mighty one?  Frank

I spoke with John Weiss (630-836-5687) @ BP Exploration & Oil Inc. (cpid #668) and he informed me that effective October 1, 2001 they will be changing the name of the company. The new entity is going to be BP Products North America Inc. 

We will need to coordinate BP Products coming on EOL and BP Exploration being shut down.

>From the legal standpoint, we have a master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc. and need to know how that will follow the new company.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

An Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig.  Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell.  I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.  If we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell.  Additionally, if we drop-shipped, oh say, 100,000 pigs into Afghanistan I think our recon and assault efforts may be more successful.  Apparently Muslims dislike the very sight of pigs A LOT!  They are also adamantly opposed to alcohol, thus we spike their water supply with a few thousand gallons of cosmopolitans, get them shit-faced, and turn the pigs loose.  The  war would be over in a weekend.  ...Just a thought.

Jeannine -

I have have been asked to work with you directly on completing a
non-disclosure agreement between Experian and Enron Credit, Inc.

As you can see from the below message, I have been provided with your
Addendum to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Based upon this document, I

that all terms are contained in one agreement.  I have attached a
redlined version of the agreement below for your review.

I have not incorporated portions of your suggested changes to Paragraph
1 (a portion of the last sentence) or Paragraph 8 (now 18)(the lenght of
the confidentiality obligations).  Otherwise, all modifications have
been incorporated.

Please review the attached at your convenience and let me know your
thoughts.  If this draft meets with your approval, please let me know
and I will forward originals for Experian's signature.

					Tana, 

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

					We will prepare 32 Thursday.

1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. has provided Enron with a letter of credit through January 31, 2002 and Wendy is now comfortable in amending their EOL profile.  We will open their access to trade US East and US West Physical Power with a 2 month tenor.  When we enter the calendar month of November this tenor will be decreased to 1 month and when we enter the calendar month of December this tenor will be decreased to 0 months.

If possible, could we please have this amended for trading - beginning of the day on Monday.  I have made the requisite credit changes in Profile Manager.

Thanks in advance!

Ray - 
I apologize.  It appears that I did not circulate the agreement for signature.  I have done so this a.m. and it should be sent to you later today.
One note, in Paragraph 2.1, Quallaby had inserted the phrase "best efforts" in relation to action by Enron to procure protection for disclosed information.  I have revised this one item to read "reasonable efforts" - which is consistent with my comments made in other areas of the agreement.
Thanks for the patience and, once again, I apologize for the delay.

      The changes made are acceptable.  I will have two originals 
   circulated 
      internally for signature and forward them to your company for 
      counter-signature. 
      As I will be out of the office through tomorrow, it may be the end of

                Attached you'll find a clean and blackline version of the 
        revised agreement which reflects changes resulting from your items 
        1,2,3 and 5 below.  The intent behind not changing item 4 is that 
   if 
        Enron were to use the software in one of the identified "dangerous 
   or 
        hazardous" uses Enron would be on it's own.  If you have any 
   further 
        questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me at 978 
        322-4220.  Otherwise please arrange to execute 1 original and fax 
   it

        Ray - 
        Thanks for the response and the black line.  Below are my 
   additional 
        comments: 
        1.  The reference to "Hardware Products" needs to be deleted, as 
   does 
        the 
        Schedule B.  It is my understanding that the hardware is provided 
   by a 
        different vendor.  If it is necessary to reference the hardware as 
   a 
        requirement for running the software programs, this should be 
   listed 
        in 
        Schedule A as a specification. 
        2.  Paragraph 2.1 - the term "its best efforts" should be replaced 
        with 
        "reasonable efforts" and, if it is Quallaby's position that Enron 
        pursue 
        confidential treatment of the information, despite legal 
   requirements 
        to 
        disclosed placed on Enron, the reasonable cost for pursuing this 
        protection 
        should be borne by Quallaby. 
        3.  Paragraph 3.2 - the change made at the end of the paragraph 
   needs 
        to 
        read "... BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
        THE 
        INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION 3.1(a) AND 3.1(b) ABOVE."  Since 
        neither 
        of the referenced provisions are, themselves, warranties, it is 
        incorrect 
        to reference them in 3.2 as being warranties. 
        4.  Paragraph 3.3 - the following language should be inserted after 
        the 
        word "applications" - "save and except for any indemnity 
   obligations 
        of 
        Quallaby set forth in Section 3.1 above."  By not having this 
        reference, it 
        is possible that section 3.3 could be read to negate Quallaby's 
        obligations 
        as set out in Section 3.1. 
        5.  In Section 5 of the Agreement - a new paragraph should be added 
   as 
        paragraph 5.9 to indicate as follows:  "The provisions of Sections 
   2, 
        3 and 
        4 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement." 
        This is 
        more so important now that Quallaby has included specific 
   provisions 
        enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an 
        infringement 
        claim. 
        With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the 
        agreement, 
        we are prepared to move this matter forward. 
        Thanks for your continued assistance and cooperation. 
        Mark

To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, Tana can probably help.

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the "sponsor" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I "approve" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a "placeholder" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these "approvals" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the "extranet" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  "EWS - Legal" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  "Legal Web Maint."  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting "ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic", "Jurisdiction Document Library", and "European Document Libarary" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

Hi Tana

I am putting on the Financial Trading Agreements database ISDAs that are currently under negotiation and have a couple of questions (sorry Matt is away today).

Where the Credit Contact is not listed under the arrows how do I add a new one? I have the same problem with an Enron entity - EFET LLC is not on there.

Hope you are surviving OK over there.

Tana -

Dan Diamond called me.  He needs new documents for TFS Energy LLC for BrokerClient.  TFS currently has in place a US BETA/Fee Agreement.  Dan indicated we need to do similar documents for Europe trading activities.  The entity will be the same entity - TFS Energy LLC (operating out of its London office - to be confirmed) - and the products will be the following:  Continental Power, International Coal and UK Sea Freight.  The cost for these products is $150,000 to be paid at time of signing (unless the US TFS agreement has a different time period for payment) and the term is to be consistent with the US documents (e.g., to expire on the same date next year as the US deal even if it is not a full year).

Could you take a look at the US documents and prepare agreements based on the above.  I will review them once you have them ready.

Thanks.

Mark

Tana, 

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.

This is an example of why we'd like someone from Legal to attend the GCP meeting on Monday.  Is anyone planning to attend from the financials group?

The Counterparty system indicates that this counterparty was suspended on 3/15/01.  Cheryl Johnson's (Counterparty Group) comments state:  
 
"Spoke to Bill Bergner who states that he has sent documentation to legal regarding the conversion.  He said they did business under a group of different entities other than "Inc."  In Jan. '99, they combined those entities to form the LLC, so it wasn't a simple conversion per se.  He also stated that this entity should be deleted (inactivated), as there will be no business conducted in that name.  This record will be suspended pending inactivation."
 
Does anyone in legal know anything about this because we do have an active contract in the contract system?
 
This is part of the contract audit I've been working on.

Ditto credit -- except
Electric District Number Eight and Kensington Energy, Ltd. not authorized to trade US power -- not current CPs/not FERC approved.  (I'm following up with Tracy by this e-mail to look into Electric District Number Eight.)

Tracy -- what do you know about Electric District Number Eight?

The Counterparty System indicates that Louis Dreyfus Energy Corp. CP#84 and CP #31950 were made inactive.  There is no reference to any other counterparty in the way of a merger, amalgamation etc.
 
Can you verify this information because we have an active contract in Global between Louis Dreyfus Energy Corp and CMI K#95000446.
 
Thanks for all your help.

Tana,

I was thinking of you today because I just got my issue of Texas Monthly and
both of your Houston employers were subjects of stories.  You might be
interested.

How have you been?  I really appreciate your putting me up for the weekend.
I would very gladly return the favor if I can.  Which reminds me.  Do you
want to come here this summer to see the Vatican exhibit?  The tickets are
free, you just need to reserve them.  There is an 800 number for info.  When
I find it again I can send it to you.  There is also a website,under the
auspices of Texas Tech museum.

That's all for now.  Take care.

Kathy

Subject:	EOL - Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"

MUCH THANKS!!!

Anne,

Thank you for reviewing the changes.  I was out of the office until today.
I don't think that term change will be a problem; however,  I will check
with our legal on all changes.  I should have a definative answer by the end
of the week.

As per your email, if the changes are acceptable, we will notify you and
should receive originals from Enron.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 281-681-9500 ext 4.

We are good to go based on the latest draft  of the above amendment letter.  Would you kindly prepare execution copies for us.
I would ask that the attention party be Commodities and that the greeting be simply "Ladies and Gentlemen."

Also we will need two signature lines.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf NDA

Tana/Mark,
Columbia Gulf has requested the following changes to their NDA. The legal entity name should read "Columbia Gulf Transmission Company."  They would also like to add point number 9 which states, " The execution of this agreement relative to confidential information does not obligate either party to enter into any other agreement or any transaction as that term is referenced herein."

As long as you don't have any issues with the changes, please forward a copy to Jim Hart at Columbia.  They are scheduled to come over for a demo next week.

Thanks,

Dan

Gayla -

Thanks for talking earlier today.  While I still would like to have your business people confirm their rationale for having a bi-lateral agreement, I have looked over the Williams form and noted my comments.  I have attached the redlined version below.  

I have retained the concept of exclusivity for the term of the agreement and for one year following termination as the product developed by CommodityLogic is of significant importance.  Since Williams is currently evaluating the product for potential use, I believe your business personnel can appreciate the viability of this product and understand CommodityLogic's concerns.  I am hopeful that we can reach resolution on this agreement promptly.

Thanks.

Tana,

I just wanted to follow up on this issue to see if we can simply move these deals over to "Not to be confirmed.''

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  


Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Michael -

I have attached below a revised version of the Channel Marketing Agreement with Deloitte.  This document is the most current form of agreement that needs to be used for these deals and also reflects my comments.  These comments are based upon the comments submitted by Deloitte.  I have incorporated those that we discussed and made some additional comments.  You will note that in the "Fee Payment" section, I have included the present value concept that you requested.  I have not, however, defined this concept, but would assert that it should be defined in the agreement.  Accordingly, please let me know how you want to define it.

As I indicated above, this is a bit of a different form than the one you submitted to Deloitte for review.  So that we can ensure that accurate documents are distributed, please allow us to prepare the drafts for distribution to potential channel marketing partners.  Like the preparation of NDA's, this will enable the Legal Dept. to keep track of the agreement and ensure the right version is used.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark

Caminus took out reference to EOL.   Would this be too broad?   How can we accommodate their wishes below?

Our attorney was fine with the NDA except that by restricting it to
information about the Enron On Line website, it would not cover material
which Caminus might disclose to you in that meeting.

Here it is back with a simple change to make it symmetric

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Mr. Bonner -

Attached is a new Confidentiality Agreement between SunGard Trading & Risk Systems and EnronOnline/Enron Net Works.  This agreement is being provided in order to enable current discussions to move forward and to facilitate the work contemplated in the 10/24 letter forwarded by Mr. Popp.  

I realize we have an existing CA with Automated Securities Clearance, Ltd.; however, since this entity is not the same as STRS, a new agreement has been proposed.  If discussions between the parties result in the involvement of other SunGard entities, we can address this at that time by either providing new agreements for each entity or amending the attached to encompass the new entities. 

Please have the attached reviewed at your convenience and let me know if SunGard should have any comments or questions.

Thanks for your assistance.

Lisa,

Please give Amerex Power read access to North American emissions products.  Once we get an amendment we will open up for transact status.

Mark/Tana,

Can you draft an amendment to the fee agreement to allow transact status on NA emissions.  I would like to reserve the right to pull it back if we want to as they are not paying any incremental fee.

There is no broker fee.  The broker is not part of the deal and does not pay the book.  The company on the other side of broker is who you are matched with and who pays.  You will not have to do anything.  You would simply see the brokers name with the counterparty if they initiated the transaction.

Bob,
If there is no broker fee involved on an online transaction and they pay the book direct  then we'll give them access.
Let me know what needs done,

Trevor,
This would not mean that you need to take a call from them only that they can electronically transact for a customer based upon your bid/offer on EnronOnline.  They have a system that shows your EnronOnline numbers and if they have a counterparty willing to transact at those numbers they can initiate the transaction by clicking on the Broker Client system.  You would simply see that Amerex had initiated a trade for a particular counterparty on your EnronOnline Stack Manager.  If the transaction failed you would see that Amerex tried to do a deal for a customer.  If a transaction is completed you pay no brokerage fee for the electronic introduction.  I believe this is just incremental exposure of your bid offer.  Let me know.

We'd like to keep Amerex out of our EOL pricing.  NatSource is performing the same objective and we're allready swamped with brokers.  If they have something good they can give us a buzz.

Trevor,

Amerex currently has access to many of our commodities on an application called Broker Client.  This allows them to enter into a transaction on behalf of a counterparty.  The deal is done as if it is a telephone brokerage deal.  Amerex is entering the Emissions space again and requested that we give them access to our emissions products also.  If they have access and do a trade for their customer we would not have to pay any brokerage on the deal.  Are you willing to let them view and transact for others on the emissions products?

There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.  I am working with Trey Cash and Melinda Winn to extract the receivables to enable the master netting agreements to be executed.  For now, please touch base with me prior to initialing any master netting that includes power.  Please note we are still working on the extraction from the gas receivables as well.

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  


Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

I suppose we will have the same fact situation in the Physical Gas and Power world.  I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on the need for or any alternatives you may have to the solution that Anne has come up with.

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

We have received an executed Amendment Agreement dated as of September 19, 2001 between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  The amendment (i) amends the definition of "Specified Swap" to include foreign exchange spot or foreign exchange forward transactions or currency option transactions; (ii) to specify that The Chase Manhattan Bank is a Multibranch Party and may act through any Office specified in a confirmation; and (ii) to add a "Scope of the Agreement" provision which states that if the parties enter into a "Specified Swap" (as defined in the master agreement) such "Specified Swap" shall be subject to, governed by and construed in accordance with the terms of the agreement unless the confirmation relating thereto specifically states to the contrary.

In addition, we have received an executed Amendment Agreement dated as of November 8, 2001 between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  The amendment replaces the definitions of "Settlement Amount" and "Loss" as set forth in the master agreement.

Copies will be distributed.

Subject:	Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update

Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC on 11/2/01;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01;

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above (except item "f") are on my desk in a file marked "Hess" and any documents I've drafted are on a disk marked "Hess" or in my email files (Holly can get into these).

Stephanie -

Can you finalize the attached and have it signed.  I need to initial it, but it needs to be signed by Brad Richter.

Thanks.

I am still working on this audit and I have found in Legal's Financial Lotus Notes tracking system that Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., created by Lisa Wheeler on 2/23/97, the status says "Draft Sent".  
 
It should be changed to "Executed" since there is an executed copy of their Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in Livelink.  This particular Morgan Stanley's Contract number is 95000191, CP #9409.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Vince,

It was good to talk to you today.  I need the following for the NDA:
Exact legal name
Corp Address
Contact (if other than you) and title 

Hopefully we can strike a mutually fruitful relationship.

Talk to you soon,
Nick


P.S.
Also, just a couple of suggestions for your web site team.
1.  Get rid of the "boing" mouseovers on the main page.That's awful!
2.  Under "Contact" it should be more than a form to email in.  Add
contact information.

Just my thoughts.  I liked your previous site (from a user-friendliness
perspective) better.

Not quite... the transactions are assigned to RBS, but the document reads t=
hat RBS and ENA are deemed to have entered into an ISDA that replicates the=
 1994 NWB/ENA ISDA.  Thus no transactions are governed by the 1999 RBS ISDA=
 and it should be terminated.

Kay -

I need a conflicts check on APB Financial LLC.  This company was known as APB Energy so I need both names checked.

Thanks.

Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis f=
rom a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the tra=
nsactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake tr=
ades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is n=
ot blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We h=
ave been handling these by using a written termination rather than a revers=
e trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders h=
ave agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by=
 mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the c=
onfirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you=
 a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out o=
f a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake =
is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is=
 mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the o=
riginal trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alter=
native we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's=
 "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I=
 know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

We do have mistakes from time to time, as you suspected.  In almost all cas=
es, the respective traders agree to cancel these by entering into a back to=

my attention

Notice No. 01-439
December 20, 2001

TO: 		All Exchange Members and Member Firms

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		Exchange Acquires Confirmation Clearing Corp.
________________________________________________________

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has purchased the assets of
Confirmation Clearing Corp., a firm that provides software to confirm
over-the-counter (OTC) energy transactions.

The software, which is currently in the pilot testing phase, will help
streamline the back office operations involved in confirming OTC trades by
providing standardized, electronic forms through which participants can
confirm their trades within 24 hours of the transaction.

The Exchange plans to make this software available as part of its initiative
to service the OTC trading community.  In the next few months, we plan to
extensively broaden the products and services available to this segment of
the trading community and truly make the New York Mercantile Exchange the
one-stop shop for the entire energy industry. The e-confirmations that this
software provides will add increased efficiency and transparency to OTC
business and further extend the high standards that have come to be
associated with the New York Mercantile Exchange name.

To participate in the pilot program, visit www.confirmcorp.com.

A fabulous good morning wine lovers,
Well, it is that time of year again.  I hope all of you have been watching =
your food intake like I have, because I certainly intend to eat my fair sha=
re of the Thanksgiving feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked quest=
ion from last weekend, "Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, what wi=
ll YOU be drinking on Thanksgiving?"  Before I reveal my T-day sampler case=
, I wanted to let you know what types of food we will pairing these wines w=
ith.  We usually start with some type of shellfish, some mild, some spicy. =
 For my family and friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer some tradi=
tional stuff such as the best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (thanks to Ma=
rtha, don't you know), and assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then comes the m=
ain course: TUR-DUC-KEN (always from our friends at La Boucherie), with all=
 the 'fixins': jalepeno cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffing with sage,=
 and a pile of different veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepared, but we u=
sually stick to pretty simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin pie or pumpki=
n something.  This is where the Riesling from the sampler case comes in.  I=
t is also amazing with the shellfish.  To make this meal a smashing success=
, I have selected the following sampler case of 12 bottles:

CHRISTOPHER'S PERSONAL THANKSGIVING SAMPLER (2 BTLS EACH): =20

Baron Foulon Sauvignon Blanc 2000 =20

                (classic Sauvignon Blanc, very similar to expensive Sancerr=
e) 87 points =20

                (FABULOUS, semi-dry Riesling, like a crisp red apple) 88 po=

Domaine du Pain de Sucre Pinot Noir 1997 =20

                (packed with the most amazing Pinot fruit, tastes like a $3=
5 Burgundy) 88 points =20
Les Magnans Vacqueyras 1998 =20

                (from our current web-site newsletter, serious Grenache, th=

Tana,

Per my voice mail, I received a call from Gregg Thompson with Coast energy Canada, and US.  He has several questions regarding the base contract that they have with Enron, and EnronOnline.  For example, if their users logged into EOL under Coast Canada, and transacted on an US product, what underlying agreement would be governed?  From my conversation with Gregg, I believe that they are trying to figure out  what contract applies to what entity, when transacted on EOL.  If you could give them a call they would really appreciate it.  Thanks for your time.



He can be reached at 281-274-7690
Thanks
TARA

To all of the Victims of Genia's Pranks:

It's time to get her back for all of the pain, anguish and embarrassment that Genia has caused us!  If we approach this as a group, we can get her good.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I'm game for anything!!!

RE:

Members - Revised Hours


The expiration date for the December 2001 options contract for Unleaded
Gasoline (GOZ1), Heating Oil (OHZ1) and Natural Gas (ONZ1) is Tuesday,
November 27, 2001.


GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options

representative present at their normal work station promptly at 4:40 p.m.
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making
the expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Processing (299-2068 and 299-2169)

ALL POSITIONS ARE DEEMED FINAL
Upon completion of all PCS input, all positions will be deemed final.

Mark:

Looks fine to me but Kristina Mordaunt or one of her staff need to be my final eyes and ears.  One note - the non-solicit covers people that we come in contact with through the process - I suggest we make a quick check that we are currently not in discussions with anyone at the company already.

Subject:	Confidentiality Agreement With EonXChange

Gentlemen - 

We are working on a non-disclosure agreement with eonxchange, Inc., a software company involved in the building, licensing and operating of "smart electronic exchanges" through the use of "thought-ware."  The basis for the NDA is the disclosure between the companies of software products and ideas (associated with the EOL software) and discussions concerning a possible transaction involving either the purchase or long term license of some aspects of the products eonxchange owns.  This possible transaction is in association with an ongoing project by ENW involving the EOL software.

The original NDA provided was provided to ENW through a financial advisor to eonxchange (Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital) and contained a unilateral non-solicitation provision in favor of eonxchange.  We have responded a bilateral provision consistent with our standard non-solicitation provision.  I have attempted to further limit this language so that it would only be applicable between eonxchange and ENW (and not affiliates/subsidiary and parent companies).  This was, however, rejected by eonxchange.

I have attached the most current provision below for your review, comment and/or approval.  At your convenience, please let me know if the attached is acceptable for the eonxchange non-disclosure agreement.

If any of you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Tana,

In trying to complete my assignment on the NETCO Adoption Agreements, I have found that 11 Gas, 6 Power and 6 Financial Adoption Agreements remain outstanding.  Before "bothering" the people assigned to complete the Adoption Agreements, I would appreciate your checking your records to determine the following:

1.	Was the particular Master noted on the attached spreadsheet in fact identified and/or found and given to someone?
2.	If the Master was identified/found, was it reassigned to another person than that named on the attached spreadsheet.

Thanks for your help in getting this all figured out.

Steve

Tana -

Do we have anything on this entity that is in the pipeline?  I do not have anything on this.  

If you do not, I wonder if it is another one that Dan Hyval was handling prior to his departure?

Tana, 

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.

Notice No. 01-406

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	EXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECUTION
AND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced an expanded slate of
natural gas products and services that it plans to introduce on an expedited
basis, including an electronically traded, cleared Henry Hub swaps contract
for the December 3 trading session, which begins with the NYMEX ACCESS

session on Sunday night, December 2; listings of additional natural gas
futures contracts as far as six years out beginning with the NYMEX ACCESS

session tonight; extended natural gas options contracts beginning with the
Monday open outcry session; and large order execution (LOX) in the first two
months of the natural gas futures contract also beginning tomorrow.

The contract specifications for the Henry Hub swaps contract will closely
parallel those of the Henry Hub futures contract other than it will be
financially settled, based on the final settlement price of the Henry Hub
futures contract.  The trading symbol will be NN.  Trading will begin at 7
PM Sunday night, with a pre-opening session beginning at 3 PM.

The Exchange currently lists the natural gas futures contract for 36
consecutive months and will list an additional 36 consecutive months
beginning tomorrow.  The Exchange currently lists 12 consecutive months of
natural gas options and eight additional quarterly contracts on a
March/June/September/December cycle, and, on Monday, will add 12 additional
quarterly contracts on the same cycle.  The Henry Hub swaps contract will be
available for the closest 72 consecutive months.

LOX will be permitted throughout the open outcry sessions, except during the
closing range. Under the new procedures, orders for a minimum of 250
contracts and a maximum of 5,000 contracts will be permitted outside of the
bid/ask spread for smaller trades, as long as the trade is within the
session's maximum price fluctuation limits.

Floor traders wishing to participate in a LOX market on behalf of a customer
or themselves must verbally submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an Exchange
employee, who will act as the LOX book holder, stipulating the delivery
month and number of contracts involved. The book holder will only recognize
initial responses that are for the full amount of the RFQ. Once a response
to the RFQ is formally recognized, the requesting member has 30 seconds to
react to the market.

There will be a $2.50 per contract charge for any RFQ that receives a
responding quote. If the RFQ results in a trade, the fee will be reduced to
$1.50 per contract.

Members trading for their own accounts may participate in a trade subsequent
to the initial response, but the member who first responded with the best
bid or offer for the large order will never receive less than a 50%
allocation of a completed trade.

In addition to formally recognizing the participants involved in a LOX
order, the book holder will be responsible for enforcing time limits,
maintaining records, and ensuring that trades with multiple responding
participants are allocated to the provisions in the rules.

Looks okay.  Are you going to e-mail me a clean set of docs so that I can
send them to Mahonia (we need to change all references from Sept. 27 to
Sept.28)?  The authorized signatory will apparently only be available there
in the morning.

     John

     Further to our discussions I have discussed the tax situation with the
     Directors of Mahonia Limited and they have advised that:

     Mahonia Limited has taken no tax or legal advice in connection with
     the
     transaction and is not represented in the US by US council.  However,
     the
     Directors believe that Mahonia Limited is only carrying on a trade or
     business in the island of Jersey and accordingly the applicable law is
     that
     of the island of Jersey and there is no withholding tax under Jersey
     Law.

     They are happy to provide the representations detailed in Annex A to
     the
     ENAC Swap and to complete the W8-ben form on the basis of their
     understanding as described above.

     Kind regards

     Yours sincerely
     For and on behalf of
     Mourant & Co. Secretaries Limited

We are considering them to re-design our web site. Both The Adcetera Group and Organic Inc. are submitting proposals to work on the project and we need them to be under the same NDA. It would be great if you could e-mail the agreement. Pagogh Cho is our main contact and can distribute the agreements to the other people on the list. His e-mail address is pcho@adcetera.com. Thanks for your help.

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.

Please see the below document.  It appears to be the version of the APB Europe BETA that we were looking for.  Please compare it to the APB Energy US agreement and let me know if they are consistent.

Bob,

Here is the revised BETA for Europe.  The changes reflect the revised
language that Mark originally provided to the original BETA with APB Energy,
Inc.  My understanding is that there has been no agreement yet on what the
fee should be; so, I have made no comment or change to that language at this
point, while you and Chris discuss this issue.

My understanding is that there should be only one letter of credit for all
APB entities.  Also keep in mind that before too long the letter of credit,
and the APB Energy, Inc. BETA and Fee Agreement, will need to be in the name
of APB Energy Intl. LLC, which will be the successor to the operations of
APB Energy, Inc. as a result of a business acquisitin we soon hope to
complete.

If you have questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Joe Wright

Joe,

Chris and I discussed next steps for the Broker Client agreements for
Europe.  We concluded that it would be best to proceed with finalizing
documents in anticipation of your acquisition in Europe.  Chris
indicated that you had amended the draft that Mark sent.  Could you
please send us the document for review?

Thanks

Short-form FCPA clause as follows - 

 	Both parties agree that they will not, and shall procure that its Affiliates and their respective employees will not, make, cause to be made, or promise or offer to make, in connection with this Agreement, any payment, loan, gift or transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly: (i) to or for the use or benefit of any government official or government employee (including employees of government-owned entities or corporations); or (ii) to any political party, official of a political party or candidate; or (iii) to an intermediary for payment to any of the foregoing, in order to obtain or retain business or to secure any improper advantage.

I think the full one-page clause plus one-page schedule is a bit much for a confidentiality agreement but the above might be appropriate.
I will be around for a little while this evening so any other problems give me a call.
Thanks
Mike

You were right.  All I'm saying is that if you're talking to someone on the phone who is not familiar with these docs you might reach the wrong conclusion because the docs are so close.  In answer to your other question, I am positive both were executed.

Mike, this amendments are indeed almost identical.  One is titled "First Amendment to Master Energy Purchae and Sale Agreement -- this one is not executed.  The other is titled "First Amendment to Master Purchase and Sales Agreement and this one is executed.  Were we wrong in assuming that the one referring to Energy is for Power and the other one refers to gas???

Remember that the power and gas amendments look on their face to be identical documents, and you have to read very closely to see that they are indeed different.  Are we sure that we are not looking at 2 different docs--a gas one and a power one--and concluding that they are the same and therefore that we are missing one?

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.

Hey Tana.  

I got a call this morning from someone in the DB offices in London who seems to think that the issues between us, relating to
EOL I guess, are all settled - and she'd like to know where we'll be signing their assignment agreement.  Can you give her
a call:

011 44 207 547 0883

I think her name is Sara - but I listened to her messege 4 times, and can't really make out what she said her name was. 

Thanks,
Diane

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

Chuck -

John Allario forwarded the comments you made to the NDA for my review and comment.  I agree with all revisions, but the change to the business relationship provision in the introductory paragraph.  I would propose that we state the "Project" to be "... each of Enron's and Amerada's affiliates are prepared to furnish each other with information in connection with a possible business transaction or relationship based upon use of the EnronOnline platform or software (the "Project")..."  The statement made in your revision is a bit beyond what is actually intended to be discussed.

Please consider this change and let me know your thoughts.  If this is acceptable, I will incorporate it into final agreements, together with your other comments, and see that final agreements are forwarded for signature.

Thanks.

Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above are on my desk in a file marked "Hess".

Hi Tana.

Could you please forward Ross or me a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Mr. Massoud Sedigh

Houston, TX 77002

Thank you.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.

2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Looks good. I'd suggest changing "EnronOnline website" in the first paragraph to the broader "EnronOnline eMarketplace platform" just to be safe.

Mark --

This looks fine to me.  I believe that Henry Bonner of SunGard is travelling tonight and will be in Houston tomorrow.  He left a message saying that he will call with the hotel fax number when he gets to his destination.  I will forward that information as soon as I receive it so that we can get the NDA  and signed letter to him.  Henry's cell phone number is 917 373 5844 (Cell).  Thanks.

Rex/Mark -

As we discussed, I am not confident that the Automated Securities Clearance NDA sufficiently covers us in this new matter.  I have called Henry Bonner at SunGard to verify the legal structure to see if we can or cannot use it; however, he has yet to return my call.

I have prepared the attached based upon a belief that we should have in place an NDA specifically with SunGard Trading & Risk Systems.  Because we also want to move this matter forward, I have attached to the agreement a "Schedule A" in which I have outlined the work that SunGard will be performing for us - at least at the onset.  If we go beyond the first five days of this work, we should definitely have a formal consulting agreement signed to ensure we have a clear path forward on the work to be done and deliverables to be provided.

In the meantime, please take a look at the attached and let me know if this works.

Thanks.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Subject: COUNTERPARTIES NOT IN THE FINANCIAL TRACKING SYSTEM
 
I am working on a financial contract audit and could not find any records in the Financial Lotus Notes Tracking system for the following counterparties.  I was able to pull and make copies of the executed agreements from your legal files last week and I am sending them to the file room to be scanned into Livelink and properly filed.
 
Since the Financial tracking system is one of our means of verifying information, would you please populate this information in it?  If any of these counterparties are not active, I will need to know that information also.

Lorie -

Sorry for the typo and misspellings.  I have reviewed the agreement again and made changes to Paragraphs 7 and 8.  I have attached the final version below.  

As to getting this out today, that is fine.  Since I will need to initial the final letters, why don't we generate them up here and send them down for signature.  You can then attach the pricing and product description items.

Mark

Mark,

Hope you had a good weekend and thanks for the quick response.

There were a few misspellings of names and a typo which we have changed.  The only question I have is in paragraphs 7 & 8, we still refer to a Term Sheet, should this be changed to Product Description? please advise.

Pursuant to our discussion, I have attached an updated draft of the LOI.  I have not attached either the product description nor the pricing schedule as this can be accomplished once we finalize the LOI.

Please take look at the attached and let me know if there are any further comments or questions.

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Subject:	Issue to be resolved and acted upon

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is "Any".  But "Any" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that "Any" means "Any Global Product" ;"Any" means "anything".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the "someone" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

	5)	Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test.

Kelly -

We have a contract with Kase and Company, Inc. under which the relationship can be terminated on 30 days notice.  However, in this situation, it apprears that both parties mutually agree that the agreement should be terminated.  Therefore, I have prepared the attached letter agreement as a form of termination agreement.  It will allow the contract to be terminated immediately - upon siging by both parties - rather than require the parties to send 30 day notice of termination.

Please take a look at the attached and let me know your thoughts.  If the attached is acceptable, I will have it finalized, initialed and forwarded for signature.

Mark

Mark-

Greetings.  In light of the "Kase Commentary" on EnronOnline's yearly anniversary, we have reviewed the publication and number of viewers, and would like to end the contract we currently have with Cynthia Kase.  She has supplied EnronOnline with the weekly publication free of charge.  Our feelings have been mirrored by her; she wishes to discontinue publishing the Commentary on the website as well.  I would like to start the ball rolling and begin any documentation needed to discontinue the publication, signed and recognized by both parties.  What are the next steps to take?  Is this something you have time for or is this matter something that we should get Barbara Gray involved in?  

Regards,
Kelly Heuertz

Todd, 

Thanks for the links.   

I have the diagram that I want to send you, but I have been asked that I get a NDA signed from Foundry before sending it.  Who is the person that I should have our legal department work with to get the NDA signed?

Thanks,
Tim

Mark,

We sent Chisholm an electronic copy of the LOI and received some comments.  

in paragraph 2, Chisholm would like to see something other than obligation, as we never state what is our 'current obligation.'  I guess the word 'obligation' raises an eyebrow.  We explained that the NDA and its conditions would still be in place.  Is there a way to tweak the language to more clearly state this and not use 'obligation'?

of course the non-solicitation clause was another point of clarification.  Currently, Chisholm is using students to develop an internal system and they have been working with other vendors.   Therefore, this clause will not work.  So we have discussed putting in a Notification clause in that Chisholm will notify us and keep us informed about the status of other vendors.  Perhaps something that would read "Chisholm agrees that it will notify Enron if and when it decides to enter into a formal agreement with any third party vendor etc."   


Give me a call if this doesn't make sense.  Thanks.   


Make It A Great Day!!

Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Gentlemen - 

We are working on a non-disclosure agreement with eonxchange, Inc., a software company involved in the building, licensing and operating of "smart electronic exchanges" through the use of "thought-ware."  The basis for the NDA is the disclosure between the companies of software products and ideas (associated with the EOL software) and discussions concerning a possible transaction involving either the purchase or long term license of some aspects of the products eonxchange owns.  This possible transaction is in association with an ongoing project by ENW involving the EOL software.

The original NDA provided was provided to ENW through a financial advisor to eonxchange (Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital) and contained a unilateral non-solicitation provision in favor of eonxchange.  We have responded a bilateral provision consistent with our standard non-solicitation provision.  I have attempted to further limit this language so that it would only be applicable between eonxchange and ENW (and not affiliates/subsidiary and parent companies).  This was, however, rejected by eonxchange.

I have attached the most current provision below for your review, comment and/or approval.  At your convenience, please let me know if the attached is acceptable for the eonxchange non-disclosure agreement.

If any of you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Heather -

Thanks for the information.  At this time, we prefer to use our form documents.  I understand that Tana is currently working on the NDA for this company, based upon information Erica provided.  As to the form of agreement, I can probably have something by the end of the day tomorrow for 2Advanced.com to look at.  Please let me know what the "agressive" schedule is.

Thanks.

Hi Mark,
	As Erica mentioned, we are going to move forward with 2advanced.com to redo the EnronOnline website.  I will be the primary point of contact between Enron and the agency, but please cc Erica Bess as well. Here is the contract and the two-way NDA 2advanced.com sent over.  True to Enron form, we are pushing a very aggressive schedule, so please let me know if you need any other additional information or if I can be of any assistance in any way.

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to "kill" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1).

Tana -

When you have the ETA amendment letter ready for TECO to see, could you please e-mail it to Pat Castoro at TECO (pacastoro@tecoenergy.com) and also forward a copy to their counsel - Brian Harms (brian.harms@troutmansanders.com).

The legal name  that needs to be on this letter is TECO EnergySource, Inc.  There will also be a second letter amendment for a partnership that is being formed by TECO under the name TECO-Panda Generating Company, LP.

Thanks.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Please click on the link below.

Name:             TANA JONES
Personnel number: P00502659
Phone:            7138533399

If you have questions about electronic pay stubs, please contact Janice Priddy (Payroll) 713-853-7839 or Marie Newhouse (ClickAtHome) at 713-345-4185 or send an email to  Enron.Payroll@enron.com (Enron Payroll in Outlook).

Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

Mark,

Thanks for the response.

A couple of notes:
we somehow want to incorporate that Chisholm will not solicit or work with another front end software vendor until after February 2001 (as that is when they will be ready to begin).
we have discussed pricing with Chisholm and would like to include as an attachment the following spreadsheet so that they know we are willing to tier the proposed pricing.

 
I made some comments within the document, we can discuss via phone if you would like.

 
Lastly, we want to make sure that we are not getting 'too legal' in this letter as we have established a good rapport with Chisholm and don't want to scare them off.  I hope this makes sense.

Thanks again.


Make It A Great Day!!

Attached for your review is a first draft of a proposed LOI for Chisholm.  I have added provisions that mirror the items laid out in the product description information as these are the types of things that will be addressed in the final definitive agreements.

Please review at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.

Jeannine -

I have have been asked to work with you directly on completing a non-disclosure agreement between Experian and Enron Credit, Inc.

As you can see from the below message, I have been provided with your Addendum to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Based upon this document, I have made the appropriate changes to the original agreement forwarded so that all terms are contained in one agreement.  I have attached a redlined version of the agreement below for your review.

I have not incorporated portions of your suggested changes to Paragraph 1 (a portion of the last sentence) or Paragraph 8 (now 18)(the lenght of the confidentiality obligations).  Otherwise, all modifications have been incorporated.

Please review the attached at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.  If this draft meets with your approval, please let me know and I will forward originals for Experian's signature.

The attached file contains changes, prepared by Experian's attorneys, to the NDA we sent last week.  Their legal contact is Jeannine Ford.  Jeannine's email address is Jeannine.Ford@experian.com.  Please work directly with her to resolve outstanding issues.  

We are scheduled to meet with Experian Tuesday 11/6, to discuss the application of their data.  The NDA needs to be in place by that time.

Please contact me with any questions.

I'm sure you did not expect this, but our legal department has made some
suggested changes to your standard non disclosure agreement. They prepared them
in the form of an Addedum and I am attaching it for your review. Please call me
if we need to get the legal teams talking.

Tana, I have reviewed and revised the contract list you sent to me and attach my revision, blacklined to show the changes from the document you sent to me this morning.  There were a number of errors in the list as it pertained to Canada.  Of particular note is the inclusion in the list of a number of agreements with either Enron Oil Canada Ltd. (which was part of what is now EOG) or EOTT Canada.  As far as I am aware, Enron Corp. is no longer in any way affiliated or associated with either EOG or EOTT, having divested itself of any interest in either, and Enron Canada certainly has no knowledge of, involvement with or records pertaining to any of those agreements.  I do not believe that they should be included in any master netting agreement between BP and Enron.

In addition, it appears that they have listed the master physical gas agreement with ECC twice (I have deleted the first reference, being document number one) and they did not include the IT physical gas agreement with ECC, which I have added.

I hope this helps.

Thanks
Greg

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Sharon,

BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.

THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843
Waller		979-826-7643

Nature of Discussions:

Several groups within Enron (RAC, Enron Direct North America, Enron Direct Canada,  Enron Direct U.K., Enron Credit) use credit scoring information to approve/deny credit to potential counterparties associated with deal flow.  D&B, the top source of this information in North America, only covers about 60% of the counterparties in which we have interest.  We want to bring Experian data into the credit process to get North American coverage up >90%.  It is possible that will want to use Experian to support Canada, UK, Spain and Netherlands markets as well.  As we get into discussion with Experian, we will need to reveal details about RAC, EES, EC, our systems, marketing plans, target acceptance rates, etc.  They will need to reveal limitations relating to coverage, interfaces, data structure, etc.  It is the coverage of these discussions I am seeking.

Kim -

Please provide me with the full name and address for Experian.  Also, we can forward the agreement on your behalf if you provide us with an e-mail address and contact name.  Finally, please give me some indication of the exact nature of the discussions, if there is any need to make the NDA specific vs. general.

If you provide these items today, we should be able to get our language out later this afternoon, tomorrow moring at the latest.

Mark

I have started discussions with Experian, likely to result in Experian becoming Enron's #2 provider of credit scoring data.  I need to get an NDA in place with Experian ASAP to cover sensitive items likely to be covered during our negotiations.  I would like to get our NDA language to them today.  Please advise as to how to proceed...

Henry -

Attached is a draft of the proposed confidentiality agreement for work to be pursued with Enron Net Works.  I sincerely apologize for the delay in forwarding this document to SunGard for review.  It is possible that a few additional comments will need to be added once I have discussed the document further with key business personnel.  

Please review the attached at your convenience and also forward, as necessary, to anyone else in your organization who is required to review and approve agreements of this nature.

Thanks for your patience.

Steve,

I hope this email gets through to you this time.   Rather than the Nov 1st or 2nd dates I list below, perhaps we can shoot for Nov. 19, 20,21 or Nov. 26 or 27th.   Hopefully, your legal group and my legal group can execute the NDA by those dates.    I will have a better answer for you regarding the structures of Enron's LJM and Chewco investment vehicles as soon as possible.  Please contact me with any concerns or questions.   Thanks again.

Subject:	EnronOnLine Demonstration & Meeting

Steve,

It was good speaking with you this morning.   I would like to cover a few housekeeper issues and to plan for our next meeting and the EnronOnLine (EOL) demonstation. 

Non-Disclosure Agreement

The demonstration will show you how the Market Manager programs work, the different behind-the-scenes administrative and data modules, and the screens a trader would use to load and trade on the system.    In order to show these proprietary functions and screens, my management is requiring third parties to sign a confidentiality agreement.   I have attached this agreement.   Please have your legal team review it and direct questions to Tana Jones, paralegal, at 713-853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, legal counsel, at 713-345-8897. 


Suggested Day and Time for the Meeting & Demonstration

How is November 1st or 2nd ?   What days are good for you and your team?


Format of the Demonstration

We can provide various ways to demonstrate EOL and its applications.   The simpliest way may be for HETCO to provide us with one or two desktops or laptops in order to view a remote, internet, demonstration from Houston, which would also feature an open phone line to my demo-team in Houston.  In this way, HETCO and Enron get a live demonstration of the EOL system, but avoid the IT headaches of opening up the necessary internet port and setting aside the required IP addresses, which are necessary if Enron were to bring its own laptops and projectors.   I can work with someone from your IT department to work out these details.

Thanks again for this opportunity.   Please reply or call me with any questions.     I look forward to our next meeting.

Mike, this amendments are indeed almost identical.  One is titled "First Amendment to Master Energy Purchae and Sale Agreement -- this one is not executed.  The other is titled "First Amendment to Master Purchase and Sales Agreement and this one is executed.  Were we wrong in assuming that the one referring to Energy is for Power and the other one refers to gas???

Subject:	Re: New Power Company Amendment   

Remember that the power and gas amendments look on their face to be identical documents, and you have to read very closely to see that they are indeed different.  Are we sure that we are not looking at 2 different docs--a gas one and a power one--and concluding that they are the same and therefore that we are missing one?

Documentum just called back.  They said they manually reviewed everything that has not yet been scanned into the system and cannot find any Agreements or Amendments for New Power Company.

I have checked with Karen Cordova since her initials are on the document to see if possibly she had any extra documents, and she does not.  I doubt we will be able to get an executed copy of this Amendment.

Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!

Jay-

HSBC has responded to legal with comments on the NDA.  They are requesting that the term of the NDA be one year instead of our standard two years.  We intend on discussing a private e-marketplace and possibly f/x posting.  They would like to see the standard demo for the discussion around the private e-marketplace.  What is your position on their NDA request considering what they will see in the demo?

Erica -

Please provide me with the necessary information on the company (e.g., contact name, address, etc.).  I'll make sure that we get the confidentiality agreement moving forward.

Thanks.

Tana,

To follow-up with the message I left with you.  

Cinergy Services would like to transact on US East Financial Power product PJM Bal of Day and the new Cinergy Hourly Index (which is coming on-line soon).

I understand they don't have a Master Agreement under this entity.  The trader mentioned a "long form confirm", which is what is governing the trades they do with us OTC and is wondering if that would suffice.

Please call their attorney Mr. Jeff Gollomp to discuss.

Thanks for your assistance !

T.
