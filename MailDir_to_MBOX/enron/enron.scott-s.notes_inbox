 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

Subject: TW Fuel

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

deus ex machina (DAY-uhs eks ma-kuh-nuh, -nah, MAK-uh-nuh) noun

   1. In Greek and Roman drama, a god lowered by stage machinery to resolve
      a plot or extricate the protagonist from a difficult situation.

   2. An unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event
      introduced suddenly in a work of fiction or drama to resolve a
      situation or untangle a plot.

   3. A person or event that provides a sudden and unexpected solution to
      a difficulty.

[New Latin deus ex machina : deus, god + ex, from + machina, machine
(translation of Greek theos apo mekhanes).]

   "In fact the duke acts as the deus ex machina of the piece, working in
   the background to ensure that everything turns out right and manipulating
   the characters' actions along the way."
   Robert Nott, Lust, justice and faith, The Santa Fe New Mexican, Jun 23,
   2000.

When we face a serious crisis we often look upwards for divine intervention.
In such hopeless times we pray to the gods to descend from heaven and
deliver us from whatever travail prevails. In ancient Greek and Roman drama,
the gods literally came down from above, though not from heaven, to help the
heros of the drama and save the plot.

As it turns out, the gods themselves needed a little bit of help coming
down. A crane was used to lower a god onto the stage and untangle the plot.
Thus he was known as deus ex machina, literally, a god from a machine. Soon
the figurative use of this device in a drama began to be described by the
same name. Greek dramatist Euripides (480-406 BC) was particularly fond
of it. We are all intimately familiar with this device thanks to popular
cinema. The hero who had supposedly drowned half-way through the story is
miraculously revived to accompany the heroine into the sunset.

This week we look at more words from the world of literature.       -Anu

Hi Girls!
It's that time again.  We need to get everyone together for our annual
Christmas Dinner.  I have spoken to many of you and tried to come up
with a good time for everyone.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be
a "perfect day", but how about Friday-Dec. 22nd?  Please respond and
tell me what you think.  I have had a few suggestions for a
place-Churrasco's, America's, Ruggles, Benji's, Sullivans-please send a
suggestion.  Don't say it doesn't matter because majority vote will win
and there will be no recount.  The time will probably be around 8 p.m.
I know the 22nd is close to Christmas, so the 19th has also been
suggested-but I am afraid not everyone will be in town yet.  Please send
me your thoughts on the day, restauraunt, and if we should plan
something after dinner.  I can't wait to see everyone and hope all can
make it!
-Laura

We should plan on being on the call.  Since Mark is not on distribution, we 
should also see if he's available to be on as well.   I'm assuming Jeff 
Dasovich will participate.  Should we let Zenee know that we'll be on the 
call and not there in person?

oh, the holiday spirit is in the air- not that i've been subjected to it 
stuck in this shitty library desperately trying to write and research things- 
believe it or not!- i should've done 3 weeks ago.....at least i'm 
consistant.? hope all is well in houston- any news about the london thing?? i 
have a sneaking suspicion it's not going to happen- call me a cynic, but i'm 
getting bad vibes, n'est pas?? damn!? claudia is driving me nuts- and i've 
had this horrible weighty sense of deja vu- couldn't figure it out til last 
week marci mentioned something that triggered?the memory: i was, of course 
bitching about how sick i am of her badgering and lecturing me to 'party' w/ 
her at her shady discos, and marci laughingly says it's prob b/c she's 
secretly a lesbian, and is trying to hit on me.....aughhhhh1? she's kim 
barton!? although i'm not saying for sure i think kim's a lesbo (yeah, right- 
she's just nuts, at the very least....) and i k! now claudia's straight- but 
it's those boarding school kids- clingy and desperate for attention, but 
soooooo much more sophisticated and wordly than just a silly little 
conservative texas girl who has had the same friends for 15 years- basically 
just fell off the potato truck...i'm soooooo naive.? it's annoying how she 
manipultes her provenence when it's convenient- she's sooooooo texas when 
it's cute to be wholesome and outdoorsy and fun, but she'd totally 
'international' when it comes to interacting with other cultures, and how 
many 'experiences' she's had.? ohhh, she's seen fire and she's seen rain, 
alright.....just want to say to her that just b/c daddy sent her away with a 
whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til 
dec 18th so she wouldn't call me- either in london or houston.? i am really 
sneaky......anyways- hope all is well- wish you were coming w/ kates- it'd be 
fun.? but- i'm sure you'll be having JUST as much fun at enron....will be 
drinking- alot- in your honor- don't worry!

Hey Lisa,

Good job on the organization.  Do you have any recommendations for what I

CPUC sees market abuses, claims overcharges

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren

gnathonic (na-THON-ik) adjective

   Sycophantic; fawning.

[From Latin gnathonicus, derivative of Gnathon- (stem of Gnatho) name of
a sycophantic character in the Roman comedy Eunuchus by Terence.]

   "And that's why today any myrmidon, any gnathonic sycophant, any
   obsequious assistant or menial hanger-on is called a toadeater or, more
   often, a toady."
   Michael Gartner, Words, Newsday, Dec 27, 1987.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.

............................................................................
A man there was, tho' some did count him mad / The more he cast away, the
more he had. -John Bunyan, preacher (1628-1688) [Pilgrim's Progress]

Yes, I have a fax at work:? 82-31-690-6295.? Sorry you are having to fool 
with all of that.? I'm sure you're right and I'll talk to you sometime 
tomorrow.

Hey Chris,

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment
complex can send you some info. regarding getting your name taken off of
our lease. If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and
I'll pass it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with
Thanksgiving and all. I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys
tomorrow along with both of our parents and extended family members. Have
a great holiday and root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough
one).

Love,
Susan

Lets talk today, susan.  I need to satisfy myself that this is really one of 
those "shit happens" situations like everyone seems to believe, rather than a 
situation where we may have a cause of action and some $$$ owed to us by 
someone.  DF

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.


**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

I received the navidad.exe virus through four e-mails from Gwen Soong this

Subject: Tom Beach may have sent you a virus


Tom Beach received the navidad virus in e-mail yesterday, and it replicated
itself and went out to many (maybe all) of the people who had sent him
e-mail that he had not yet opened (i.e., unopened mail in his Outlook
Express in-box).

Because the OII and peaking rate filings were yesterday, you probably sent
Tom e-mail that he didn't have a chance to look at.  If you have a firewall
system that rejects any e-mail with executable files attached, you're safe.
If you don't, here is the URL with the virus cure:

http://www.fsecure.com/v-descs/navidad.htm
<http://www.fsecure.com/v-descs/navidad.htm>

In Tom's system, I was able to ignore the error message about the machine
not being able to find "winsvrc.exe," open his Internet browser, and
download the virus repair file from this Web site.  It's a relatively easy
fix once that's done.

I'm terribly sorry about this.  Let me know if I can be of further
assistance.

Attached [finally] is Calpine's revisions to the Exhibit "C" to the Operating 
Agreement at the South Point project.  These revisions are intended by 
Calpine to be consistent with the discussions here in Houston during our p.m. 
meeting on Monday, Oct. 16.

Please review the Exhibit with careful attention to the impact of the revised 
operating parameters on TW's linepack (particularly the plant's variable 
operations) during the day.  If possible, could I see a preliminary 
determination of the acceptability of this revised exhibit by week's end?   
Thanks.

Susan,

I've modified the code. This time it works as you requested, the results on 
deal Q64459.3 is shown in the attached file.  You can run a script file to 
recalculate the book (or PID). The script file uses my modified version of 
PORTCALC, and  is on  UNIX,:
  ~stang/port_calc_test.csh
you can go to my home  directory  ~stang, then type port_calc_test.csh PID 

I can show you how to do it if you need any help, or give me a call.

Shouan

Okay everyone, here are the details on the party............

Party starts at 7:00, I figure we should get there around 8:00 to make our 
grand entrance.  Plan on coming by my place anytime say 6 - 6:30 ish and 
we'll head over around 7:45 or so.  I will be getting some party trays, but 
unfortunately, Uncle Enron won't pay for the alcohol.   So..........bring 
alcohol and a party attitude!

I live at Providence @ Uptown.  3323 McCue Rd #1743.  This is located behind 
the Best Buy at Richmond and 610 (also across from City Streets, not that I 
ever go there!)  You will have to dial up to my apt to get in the gate.  I 
think you hit #1743 and it dials me up.  (The directions are on the keypad).  
I live on the 4th floor, but you will need to park on the roof (5).  They are 
very particular about the parking!  There are 4 hallways off the parking 
garage at each corner.  Mine would be the SE corner, anyway the apt #'s will 
start with 1600......... you're in the right place just keep going (it's not 
that far).  There is a big plant outside my door (I know you guys are amazed 
I have living plant!)  If you have any questions my number is (713) 550-8698.

See you there!!!!!!!!!!

K.

Subject: White Elephant Christmas Luncheon


OK Gang, we will be having the 2nd Annual White Elephant Christmas Luncheon 
again this year, on Monday December 18th  at 11:30.  To be included in this 
exciting game of chance, you are required to bring a covered dish and a 
wrapped gift of $10.00 or less.  These gifts can be gifts of use, or gag 
gift.  The same rules will apply this year as last, and that is, you can only 
trade your gift twice and your out of the game.  

Julia is kind enough to provide the honey glazed ham, plates, dinner ware and 
ice tea, which we will have in EB4102. Please bring a covered dish, hours d' 
oeuvres or a dessert (keep in mind, we could have a lot of people attend).  
She is also extending her invitation to the other departments on this floor, 
in hopes they would like to participate.

Julie, Candace and Audrey, could you please forward this on to your groups 
within the 41st floor.

See ya there!!!!!!!!
Ricki

Please help... I'm getting really tired of looking at this.  When you read 
it, bear in mind that we're hoping to get Caithness "off the dime" in terms 
of moving forward, while helping them out with their modeling efforts by 
giving them a "starting number" for purposes of the lateral transportation 
cost.  Thanks!!!!

gemutlichkeit (guh-myoo-likh-KYT, -MOOT-) noun

   Warm friendliness; amicability.

[German, from gemutlich, congenial.]

   "Ernst's round figures have an endearingly toylike gemutlichkeit, however,
   and youngsters may still find the out-of folktale experience a diverting
   one."
   Deborah Stevenson, Goldilocks Returns by Lisa Campbell Ernst (review),
   Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, May 1, 2000.

This week's theme: words from the German language.

.............................................................................
The influence of each human being on others in this life is a kind of
immortality. -John Quincy Adams, 6th president of the U.S. (1767-1848)

Team,  thought you would find this somewhat interesting  
and?explanatory?of?California's  near? term panic . Our  California 
Commission? is predisposed to do almost anything to stem the  tide of higher 
energy prices. Their latest manifestation of complete melt-down  comes in the 
form of attempting to modify electric QF payments by abandoning the  current 
gas index methodology utilized by all three utilities. Essentially, the  
proposed decision would?immediately (effective 12/1) abandon the old  
California border gas indexes in favor of adopting a "proxy gas price".?  
This new proxy gas price would apply to all three utilities, PG&E, SCE and  
SDG&E. On a temporary basis, the gas index used for eventual electric QF  
payments will be an gas index consisting of? ( i ) 10 % of the simple  
average of three border indices at Topock ( Btu Daily, NGI, Natural Gas 
Week)  and? (ii ) 90% of the SoCal Gas Core Wacog published monthly in 
Schedule  G-CS or (in the case of PG&E) 90 % of their core published WACOG .? 
The  resultant reduction in electric QF payments is several hundreds of 
Millions of  dollars just for? December alone.
?
So  what if anything does this mean to TW ?? Clearly, TW's short term desk  
maybe be affected. If Cal border numbers run 14 - 20 dollars and power 
payments  are based upon PG&E Wacog of $7.50 gas demand for electric 
generation  will? moderate. Next, the heat level on the cause of why basin to 
border  price spreads are over $10 is not longer just a Commission vs.. EPNG 
issue. The  entire California QF population becomes a huge stakeholder. The 
never ending  search for a "bad Guy" escalates. TW needs to be careful?from 
becoming  painted with a broad brush. TW is not one of the Southwest bad 
Guys. TW's pipe  is not oversold, is point to point firm, widely held, useful 
to California's  utilities etc.
?
If any  of this is useful and you want to further explore to potential 
ramifications,  please call .? Mark, IGS
?

Subject: Max rate issue on TW

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=
=20
recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=
=20
2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=
ck=20
of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20
market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in=
=20
TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=
=20
price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20
possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20
request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20
showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds=
=20
all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=
=20
the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01("firm transportation" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=
oses=20
we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20
Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=
ther=20
pipelines are a "good substitute" only if shippers can obtain the same=20
quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=
=20
service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20
10%.  All relevant "origin markets" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=
=20
as well as "destination markets," and alternatives for shippers in those=20
markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=
=20
if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=
=20
used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=
=20
alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20
quantity.

3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20
competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=
=20
factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.=
 =20
Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point a=
nd=20
delivery point.  HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share and=
=20
squaring it.  There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation=
=20
services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities.

4.  Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues.

Hey guys!

It is that time of year when everything gets SO crazy, so I am 
thinking.........
we need to plan our Taster's Finale ahead of time so we can all mark our
calendars and so we can find a place!

Here are some thoughts:  we could do a boy/girl Taster's where we all invite
some of our friends, guys and girls to join us and we rent out a room at a
restaurant.  Or we could have just girls and have a really nice Christmas
celebration at a cool restaurant and do "Secret Santa".  Either way, it would 
be
a blast.

How does Thursday, Dec 14th sound?

So, here is what I need:  your vote on............... the type of party, then
what restaurant that goes with that idea, then affirmation of the date.

Get excited girls!  This is going to be fun!

Love you guys,
Lisa

Please approve the attached expense report and forward it to accounting with

The perfect man is gentle,
Never cruel or mean;
He has a beautiful smile,
And keeps his face so clean.
The perfect man likes children
And will raise them by your side.
He will be a darn good father
And a husband to his bride.

The perfect man loves cooking,
Cleaning and vacuuming, too.
He'll do anything in his power
To show his love to you.

The perfect man is sweet,
Writing poetry in your name.
He's a best friend to your mother
And kisses away your pain.

He never makes you cry
Or hurt in any way.
Oh,this stupid poem...
The perfect man is gay.

San Diego Gas & Electric Company's filing for emergency relief asked FERC to 
re-impose price caps for short-term releases of capacity for service to the 
California border and to points of interconnection between interstate 
pipelines and California LDCs, and provide that sellers be required to state 
separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate 
for bundled sales at these points, etc.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for 
California ISO/PX.
FERC has also posted a notice of a  Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation 
into the California market last summer.
Various Enron units continue to receive informal data requests from FERC 
staff regarding current California gas/electric 
Steve Kean has asked that all inquiries be coordinated through Sarah Novosel 
in the DC office.
Leslie Lawner is preparing Enron's response to the SDG&E emergency petition 
to put a cap on gas sales.
 





              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

          To view the Commission orders in full go to "What's New" at
     www.ferc.fed.us.

 Natural Gas Intellingence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000

Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
"There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects]," said Jeff Fawcett, a Transwestern representative. "It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern." 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las 
Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West 
of Thoreau area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Enron Oil & Gas located in the East of Thoreau area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering south of La Plata in the 
San Juan area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with El 
Paso Field Services in East of Thoreau which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Transwestern Pipeline 
Co., contact Fawcett at 713-853-1521.

OK Gang, we will be having the 2nd Annual White Elephant Christmas Luncheon

exciting game of chance, you are required to bring a covered dish and a

within the 41st floor.

See ya there!!!!!!!!
Ricki

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=

Subject: Just wanted to say...


...it was great meeting you Saturday.  To think this all started with a tip
for the guitar player.  I hope the rest of the night went well for you.
Hopefully you all (and especially the bride-to-be) had a great time.

I just flew in a little bit ago.  I caught an earlier flight out of Dallas
around 4.  I was supposed to fly out at 7, but had nothing to do at the job
fair and was forced to check out of my room by 12.  So, instead of wasting my
whole day in the hotel lobby, I decided to fly stand-by.

I just have to say that it sucks that we were both still in Dallas today, and
I had no way of getting in touch with you. It would have been nice to see you
again.  Hopefully I'll get another chance.

In all the dancing and drinking, I completely forgot to close out my tab last
night.  Translation:  my credit card is still at Have a Nice Day Cafe.  Great,
huh?  Thanks a lot...I blame you for distracting me.  If I hadn't met you, I'd
probably be sitting here with my credit card in my wallet...

I hope you know I'm just kidding.  Credit cards are replaceable.  It's not the
first time I've lost one and unfortunately probably won't be the last.

Hey, I don't want you to think I'm just the typical guy you meet in a bar.
I'm not.  In all honesty, I'm as far from that as a guy can get.  Everything I
told you Saturday night is true, so please don't think I was telling you lines
just to hook up with you.  I'm hope you realize that.

Once again, it was truly a pleasure meeting you.  I don't remember if I gave
you my info.  You now have my email address and my phone numbers are: (H)
615-831-3110 and (C) 615-364-8504, however I don't expect you to call.  I'll
call you.  Having three older sisters teaches a guy that he needs to be the
initiator, so I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

Until then, I'll be thinking about you.  If you have a chance to email, it
would be great to hear from you.  Hope you had a safe trip back to Houston.

Talk to you soon,
John

This email would have been impressive if you had the "cojones" to bet 
up-front but being a true longhorn fan explains your lack of spine.  I don't 
think Texas is that good rather A&M is that bad.  Besides, we all know that 
the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  UCLA will 
dominate next year and Texas will be forced to play second fiddle to the 
likes of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas State etc.  yet again.  I hope your 
Thanksgiving went well and you had some fun in Austin.  I will give you 
credit on one thing, the vest is a no-no and my days of playing Chip are over 
(the vest is being given to an aggie - those cult like people).  No old age 
references to the show Chips because that would just be mean.  I hope your 
Monday is going well.  

ps: I was rooting for the Longhorns and I am glad they waxed the Aggies.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

Susan

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)

Miltonic (mil-TON-ik) adjective, also Miltonian

  1. Of or pertaining to the poet Milton or his writings.

  2. Resembling Milton's majestic style.

[After John Milton (1608-1674).]

   "Siphoning off the grandeur of his Miltonic inspiration and transfusing
   it with foggily redundant obscenities, Lord-Wolff denatures evil into
   sniggering adolescent angst."
   Sybil Steinberg, Forecasts: Fiction, Publishers Weekly, Dec 20, 1999.

This week's theme: eponyms, or words coined after people's names.

Death is not extinguishing the light; it is putting out the lamp because the

I've got Bilas's "winter of discontent."  What a buffoon.  It takes more guts 
than a train robber to, on one hand, propose a spineless, ineffective 
approach to dealing with what are now recognized as serious flaws in the 
current regulatory structure, and in the same breath, go to the court of 
public opinion and whine about a gas market spinning madly out of control.  
Apparently, he's also setting the table for possible intervention in the 
market by state lawmakers or regulators if we get any more "out of whack."

Are you going over to see Bilas today with Mike Day, et al.?  Are we to 
assume by Bilas's wishy-washy statements to the media that the Comprehensive 
Settlement is still on the table?  Thoughts, please.


Natural Gas Intelligence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000
CA Officials See Potential Gas Supply Problems
Some state officials already are dubbing the upcoming heating season as 
California's "winter of discontent" as continued high wholesale natural gas 
prices are driving up consumer bills and state regulators look at options for 
unbundling Southern California Gas Co.'s transmission and storage system. 
According to other state energy officials he talks with, Richard Bilas, 
commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission, said, "We could 
have some real problems." Bilas, the former energy commissioner and 
immediate-past president of the CPUC, has proposed a modest unbundling of 
SoCalGas' system, given the current energy price volatility, in a proposed 
settlement decision now being reviewed. Action on the proposed decision could 
come Dec. 21, but observers predict alternate orders will be offered by some 
of Bilas's colleagues on the five-member CPUC, and that could push into next 
year final action. 
If gas prices continue at their precedent-setting levels, California likely 
will be intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it already 
has been doing regarding last summer's electricity price spikes, Bilas said. 
"There are a lot of things the state can do, but whether they are done is a 
matter of philosophical and political judgment," he said. "If gas prices get 
totally out whack in the view of a number of state decision-makers, there is 
likely to be intervention on behalf of the state into gas pricing. And I 
don't know if any of that serves the public well in the long run, but this is 
a short-run political problem." 
As for his proposed decision on settlement for the unbundling of the 
SoCalGas's system, Bilas is unsure at this point if it will stimulate a more 
robust core aggregation market --- now almost a decade old --- with added 
volumes and marketers. He said he needs to hear from participants in the 
market in response to the proposed decision, which basically adopts the more 
modest compromise of three different settlements filed with the CPUC. 
"I'll know better where this proposed decision is going in another two weeks 
after I have talked with the other commissioners and some of the parties," 
said Bilas, noting that the pending gas settlements should be the last major 
changes in California's gas market for awhile, unless the state legislature 
decides to get involved as it has on several occasions in the past three 
years. 
"Everything to do with gas matters statewide is on the table and I am not 
going to make any predictions," Bilas said during a telephone interview in 
which he expressed concerns about both natural gas and electricity issues in 
California in the coming year. He said the supply-demand imbalance for the 
state's electricity market needs long-term solutions, but he thinks 
short-term political answers will win out. 
Bilas said the recent state energy commission conclusion that California's 
electricity needs can be met with the existing plants underway or proposed 
could pan out, but only if an unlikely combination of three factors converge: 
all the plants now on the drawing board actually get built, no major electric 
or gas transmission bottlenecks occur, and energy prices stabilize. 
"Even if all of the proposed plants came on line in two years rather than 
three, I think we still would have problems," he said. "Let's face it, demand 
for electricity in the Pacific Northwest and California is growing like 
crazy. So, until there is something done on the demand side, so we get some 
demand responsiveness, just attacking the supply side I don't think is going

I would agree with mae's philosophy, but I wonder if she has had the joy of 
strolling on a beach looking hot in a string bikini.
Too many sundaes.

Tom Celentano of FERC Energy Markets (in Scott Miller's group) is collecting 
informal information about the California market.  He has asked Transwestern 
to provide the following information for the gas day of December 7.  He would 
like this data in the next few hours (preferrably via fax 202-208-1010):

Capacity available by segment 
Whether TW had any curtailments, OFOs, or any other limitations or penalties 
in place
Scheduled capacity to the California delivery point by service type
Any nominations which were not confirmed/scheduled at the California delivery 
points
Throughput

Initially he also asked for pricing data -- specifically any information that 
we have about delivered prices at the California border.  Steve Harris and I 
told him that any information we would have on this point would probably be 
hearsay or info. from gas daily or EOL sources.    He said he had access to 
published data & we could drop this part of the request.

Steve January is working on providing items 1-5.

bovarism (BO-vuh-riz-em) noun

   An exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself; conceit.

[From French bovaryisme, after Emma Bovary, a character in Flaubert's
novel Madame Bovary.]

   "The public property is not so much her as Bovarism. She is part of the
   collective unconscious. She is, and can be, everyone."
   Alan Franks, France's best-kept secret, The Times of London,
   Aug 12, 1995.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.

............................................................................
There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there
must never be a time when we fail to protest. -Elie Wiesel, writer, Nobel
laureate (1928- )

Hi, Sooz!  Hope you made it home without too many weather problems.  Was
concerned when we saw the tornado warnings.  We enjoyed meeting Craig and
really appreciate your taking the time to drive here to meet Eric.

Have a good week.  Looking forward to seeing you again for Thanksgiving!
love, mum

I need to get expense reports in by the 13th of this month.  Have you given 
me all of your receipts for this year?  The only receipt I currently have to 
send in for reimbursement is your PrimeCo bill dated 11/15/00.  Is that it?  
It looks like your December bill will have to be submitted after the cutoff 
date.

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effecti=
ve=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al=
so=20
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continu=
e=20
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the=
=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for=
=20
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for =
a=20
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=
nd=20
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20
continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look=
=20
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=
=20
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks 
Rich

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: Friday HH

I didn't get to celebrate my birthday this week, so I'm rolling it into 
Friday night's festivities.

This week's Happy Hour will be at Midtown Station, just a few blocks south of 
here.  It's as great little place with the holy trinity of the bar world - 
pool, darts, and buckets of beer.  

This is the last HH before Thanksgiving so lets make it count.  Ring in the 
holiday just like the pilgrims wouldn't.

Catch you there.

Midtown Station
2306 Brazos
Take Smith down to Hadley and hang a right.  The bar is a couple of blocks 
down on the left.

We can probably just wait until the morning of to register you, and see how 
you're feeling then....

Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I
could probably muster up the energy.? Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the
entire way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than
normal.? Do I need to do anything to sign up for the run?

any chance you'd be up for an 8K run on saturday?? only problem is that it
starts at 8:00am- too painful after your late night?? no obligation.....

Okay...My itinerary is as follows:? Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday
night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15
pm.? If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect
for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.? I am so excited to be
coming out there - -? I really need a break from Houston...not to mention
work.? The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would
love to meet your friends.? Also, please don't feel like you have to plan
the whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.

See you in a couple of weeks,
Susan

... Ashlea, I think I may be losing it!  I completely forgot that I am
leaving for Austin tomorrow afternoon and will not be able to go out!  I am
so sorry!  We have got to all get together soon... ridiculous!  I hope
everyone has fun and thank you for suggesting Downing Street... I have never
been there and definitely want to try it sometime soon!

Have a great weekend!

Love,

Jen

Just a note to alert you.  PNM will be filing a protest in Transwestern's
filing in this docket.  PNM objects to Transwestern's proposal to not permit
netting and trading of imbalances on a volumetric basis.  This is one of the
issues PNM protested in Transwestern's Order 637 filing.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our newest column from OneTravel.com's own Frugalist, Bob=20
Jones, features up-to-the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air mile=
s=20
and save you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

The Turkey Trot is more than a dance.

This week, between now and Saturday, virtually all the airlines will notice=
=20
that their planes are going to be empty Thanksgiving Day. Even though the=
=20
week surrounding Thanksgiving Day is one of the busiest air travel periods =
in=20
North America, the planes on Turkey Day lack the appropriate stuffing of=20
passengers.

You can make this work to your advantage!  Let's say that you live in=20
Chicago. Wednesday evening, your wife says to you, "Honey, take the turkey=
=20
out of the freezer downstairs and bring it up so it will thaw."  Dutifully,=
=20
you reply, "Yes dear," and go back to the Bulls game.  Thursday morning whi=
le=20
you are finishing up your beauty rest, there is a shriek from the kitchen.=
=20
Running in, you see the remains of the bird on the floor and your Lab with =
a=20
big smile on his face. Yep, you brought the turkey upstairs but put it on t=
he=20
table, not the fridge, to thaw. It looks like it will be crow for dinner fo=
r=20
you and the pup.  What to do?

As empty-nesters, you are free to do whatever you want.  You call the few=
=20
places serving Thanksgiving dinner. You find little availability at this la=
te=20
date. The hotel has one table left at 9 p.m., but the bill will probably be=
=20
in the three-figure range. Wait, you remembered reading this column last we=
ek=20
and pick up the phone. Your daughter, who married that guy whose name you=
=20
can't remember, invited you to Indianapolis for Thanksgiving, her first on=
=20
her own.  "Hi, Honey, I want to surprise your mom.  Does that invitation fo=
r=20
dinner still stand?"

"Oh, Pops, you know it does, but hasn't it been snowing a little in town?"

"Yes, dear, but don't worry, we won't be driving. What time is dinner?"

"Three o'clock, Dad, just before the game. You and Fred can watch it. Love=
=20
you, Dad, see you soon."

Back on the phone you find a fare of $120 roundtrip per person. (That is th=
e=20
current low price but I expect to drop even more over the next few days.) S=
o=20
you book your flights, tell your wife to get dressed for dinner and head fo=
r=20
the airport. You arrive in Indianapolis, spend a wonderful day with your=20
daughter and Fred (whom you realize knows absolutely nothing about football=
)=20
and catch your flight home at 7 p.m.  In bed by 9 p.m., your wife rolls ove=
r=20
and says, "Thanks for a wonderful day!"

Over the next few days, you will see some exceptional deals for travel on=
=20
Thanksgiving Day.  Watch for them, just in case!

Happy Contrails,
Bob "Mr. Maximiler" Jones

I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a 
service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC 
certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one 
example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and 
we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a 
strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream 
out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case 
until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate 
entitiy until we get down the road a ways.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

hey- just checked- JJW playing at gruene hall fri dec 15th- his sat show is
sold out.  any interest or poss. that you could leave work around 3-4 and
go?  just emailed katy about going up earlier and shopping which i know you
prob couldn't do, but could be a fun girls' nite out in NB.  kind of have to
jump on this asap b/c tix are going to sell out soon!  if you can email me
back in next 5 mins, do so, if not try to give me a quick call later- am
jogging home from the internet store, so should be home in about 45 mins!
hope all is well- and hope SINCERELY that the f*%o'n morons in florida get
swallowed up by a giant tidal wave.  IF YOU CAN'T READ A DAMN BALLOT, DON'T
VOTE!  and you DEFINITELY shouldn't be able to vote if you're shameless
enough to speak out PUBLICALLY and admit you CAN'T read a ballot....!
aughhhhhhh!  just one more bit of evidence that supports my theory that all
voters should take an IQ test, and then have their vote weighed
appropriately......

I suggest that we reschedule.
I now have an important meeting at 1:30.
I think that would cut us a little too short.
I am open Tues., Thurs., and Fri. this week and Tues. thru Fri. next week.

Sorry but I am not going to be able to make it to lunch today.  Whatever bug 
I had last week has gotten worse and I certainly would not want to expose any 
of you to this.  It is fine with me if you want to meet without me, or we can 
reschedule for later this week.

Kindest regards,

Susan, I have been discussing with Shelley the creation of a new company for 
us to hold capacity on other pipes. I would like for you to please work with 
her in helping to create this opportunity. We can discuss it further when you 
get back. Thanks.

I'm not suggesting limiting the term.  Just recognize that NEWCO will have to 
follow different rules for each of the 3 scenarios below:

30 days or Less - Can do above max rate, no need for bidding
30 days - 1 Year - Can do above max rate, all deals must be posted for bid
Greater than 1 Year - Deals limited by max. cost-based rate (unless the 
company gets around it by selling delivered gas); all capacity release deals 
of greater than 1 year Must Be Posted on the Pipeline EBB for Bid.

HI Susan-? I'm sure you got this cute email, but just in case.....What was 
the verdict for the weekend of the 15th?? I've just received a recommendation

Enclosed is a revised draft letter which a large group of CSA signatories
intend to send to the commission on Monday, in addition to any individual
comments the parties may file to the PD.  I am sending this draft to you as
I understand that some of you may not have seen the last version which was
distributed on Friday.  Our understanding now is the SoCalGas is likely to
sign the letter with a slight moderating of the tone of the final paragraphs
which describe our years of wandering in the wilderness.  ORA is for the
moment not going to sign.  The remainder of the key CSA parties will sign.
We are asking for everyone to get approval to me by phone or email
authorizing us to sign on their behalf and providing details of how you want
the name on the signature block to look by noon on Monday.  Please call me
if you have any problems with that or wish to discuss the letter.  Thank you
very much for your prompt attention to this.

Mike Day

I received the navidad.exe virus through four e-mails from Gwen Soong this
morning.  My firewall rejected the attachments and so advised me.

Subject: Tom Beach may have sent you a virus


Tom Beach received the navidad virus in e-mail yesterday, and it replicated
itself and went out to many (maybe all) of the people who had sent him
e-mail that he had not yet opened (i.e., unopened mail in his Outlook
Express in-box).

Because the OII and peaking rate filings were yesterday, you probably sent
Tom e-mail that he didn't have a chance to look at.  If you have a firewall
system that rejects any e-mail with executable files attached, you're safe.
If you don't, here is the URL with the virus cure:

http://www.fsecure.com/v-descs/navidad.htm
<http://www.fsecure.com/v-descs/navidad.htm>

In Tom's system, I was able to ignore the error message about the machine
not being able to find "winsvrc.exe," open his Internet browser, and
download the virus repair file from this Web site.  It's a relatively easy
fix once that's done.

I'm terribly sorry about this.  Let me know if I can be of further
assistance.

leitmotif also leitmotiv (LYT-mo-teef) noun

   1. A melodic passage or phrase, especially in Wagnerian opera, associated
      with a specific character, situation, or element.

   2. A dominant and recurring theme, as in a novel.

[German Leitmotiv : leiten, to lead (from Middle High German, from Old High
German leitan.) + Motiv, motif, from French motif.]

   "The whole spirit of Hallowe'en is, of course, one of `spooky' gayety and
   light-hearted ghastliness. Witches and ghosts run riot; corpses dance and
   black cats howl. `More work for the undertaker' should be the leitmotif
   of the evening's fun."
   Donald Ogden Stewart, Perfect Behavior, George H. Doran Company, 1922.

This week's theme: words from the German language.

.............................................................................
It is not what we do, but also what we do not do, for which we are
accountable. -Moliere, actor and playwright (1622-1673)

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.? As for
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.? I think it was more of an

I'm not taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very
welcomed respite.

Let me know about the times.

Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some 
available and were not looking to expand there.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Dr. Strangelove (DOK-tuhr STRAYNJ-luv) noun

   A person, especially a military or government official, who advocates

[After a character in a movie of the same name (1963) by U.S. director

   "The US tests are part of a 13-year, $60 billion `stockpile stewardship'
   program which will enable our Dr. Strangeloves to design new nuclear bombs
   in computer-simulated virtual reality."
   Stanley K. Sheinbaum & Alice Slater, It is time to abolish nuclear arms,
   New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer 1999.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.

I took all of your good suggestions and incorporated them.  I also reordered 
a few of the paragraphs and trimmed some of the language.  Look at it again

11/10/00
8:42am E.S.T.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Following an emergency meeting this morning, Congress
unanimously voted to eject Florida from the United States of America.

The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in the state's
voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000 Presidential election.

"This is the last straw," said Utah senator Orin Hatch. "First Elian
Gonzales,
now this."

Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long time in
coming.

"We're all pretty much sick of Florida," said representative Barney Frank.
"They've been a constant embarrassment for too long now."

Added Frank, "They had Dan Marino for a while, but what have they done
lately?
Oh, that's right; screw up our entire democracy. I forgot."

In a speech on the Senate floor, Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy
commented
that the loss of Florida's sizable elderly population will free up billions
of
dollars in Social Security funds.

"These are valuable funds which can now be redirected toward national
defense.
We can finally rebuild our demoralized, weakened military," said the Senator
to
roaring applause.

As a result of the Florida screw-up, the House and Senate decreed a new
election will take place in early December. This time, ballots in each state
will be tabulated by robots.

"It is clear that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,"
said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. "The presence of these new,
superior
robot mast- umm, I mean - tabulators will ensure 100% accuracy."

"Remember," said Hastert, "every vote counts, especially if it's counted by
robots."

Dynamiting will begin in Florida next Wednesday, after which the state will
be
completely geographically separated from the United States.

"After that, they're on their own," said Hastert. "I hope they sink.

Mon or Tues.  These are just my thougths!!!!!!  Can't wait to see everyone!

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes  

Linda,
Sorry it took longer than I thought to get back with you. Marketing had 
several issues come up last week.

Here are the answers to your questions.

Item 1. Is this a contract waiver? I talked with Lorraine and here is what 
Marketing wants: They would like the request form to be at a shipper level 
(LE Level) that applies to all their new, current and future LFT contracts. 
Since it will be a manual process, can you keep an LFT waiver log/book that 
is at a LE level, then place a copy of this signed overrun request form in 
each LFT contract file & change the flag to Yes on each active LFT contract 
for that shipper?
Item 2. Can they change their mind on the waiver-if so would this require an 
amendment to the contract? Answer - Yes they can change, so the field needs 
to be date effective, but would like it to be an administrative amendment 
with new request form signed by the shipper ( not an amendment through the 
contract). This would be a change for all their LFT contracts since marketing 
wants to keep it simple at an LE Shipper Level.
Item 3. Can the waiver be date sensitive? Answer -  Yes, Susan Scott will 
review the request form and make any changes needed. I will forward a copy of 
the draft I did to you and marketing and Susan to review.
Item 4. Is the contracts group suppose to be the keeper of the waiver? Answer 
- Yes, Marketing suggested that a LFT Waiver book be set up, then also they 
would like a copy of the signed request form to be in each LFT contract file.
Item 5. When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time? 
Answer - Yes at the time they are executing their first LFT contract. When we 
have the system changes in production, I will let marketing know, & they will 
advise the shippers of this new waiver.
Item 6. Where will the waiver reside? With the request, on the Web under 
blank forms? Answer - Yes, on the web, under Contracts-blank forms for  TW. 

Please let me know if you have any other issues.
Thanks Ramona

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes

Lorraine,
I talked with Linda Trevino this morning about  the LFT waiver & from what I 
could remember we  decided to send the  form letter for the waiver  with the 
LFT contract so it would be effective for the time frame of the LFT 
agreement. The system should default to no waiver which means the LFT shipper 
would be scheduled to zero when we call an LFT day at their point. If we have 
the waiver, then the flag will be set to yes. During scheduling we will 
schedule their LFT as overrun if capacity at the point was available. I do 
not have a draft waiver form, but I can get a copy of one that NNG uses.  You 
may want to address these issues from Linda. See her questions below.


Thanks Ramona

Thats more than a couple ?s.  I guess I would suggest that we talk to Ramona 
and whichever TW Marketer sponsored LFT.  I guess I didn't see it as any more 
than an interpertation of a nom as interruptible when LFT firm was not 
available, but I can tell that you have many more concerns.

Yes but I have a couple of more questions:

Is this a contract level waiver?
Can they change their mind on the waiver - if so would this require an 
amendment to the contract? 
Can the waiver be date sensitive - meaning yes today, no tomorrow?
Is there a draft of the waiver yet?
Is the contract group suppose to be the keeper of this waiver?  
When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time?
Where will the waiver reside?  With the request, on the Web under blank forms?

Let me know.

Thanks

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes  

NNG was included in this discussion prior to our rejection order.  No longer 
pertains to NNG -   I am familiar with this issue.  The situation was 
described to me as follows:   Shipper has a standing nom for a month.  i.e.   
a firm 100/day at a receipt point.  sometime during the month we call a LFT 
day at the receipt point,  the nom would automatically become an 
interruptible nom for the LFT which may or may not be scheduled,  but the key 
is that the Shipper does not have to watch the notice and make a specific 
nom.  Does that answer your questions?

Mary,
Linda called asking about these enhancements--specifically why is NNG 
included in an LFT enhancement and did we know about this overrun provision 
on LFT days.  Are you familiar with this?

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes  

Linda,

Here is the document. It posted out on the ET&S website for the Electronic 
Business Development unit under Enhancement Request In Progress Item # 523. 
The flag we must add to contracts is need when a shipper is granting us 
arthorization to schedlue their LFT firm gas as overrun on days when LFT 
service is not available.
Please review and get with me on Friday. Legal and regulatory have approved 
this scheduling of overrun volumes for LFT contracts for both NNG and TW so I 
think we will need to add the flag indicator to both contract systems.



Thanks Ramona

I am getting a jacket made for your dad to give your mom at Christmas.? I 
need to get an idea of her waist size.? He gave me a few measurements off a 
jacket in her closet, but I don't have any idea about waist or hips.? If 
either of you have a good guess let me know ASAP.? Thanks

Chris

nosegay (NOZ-gay) noun

   A small bunch of flowers.

[Middle English : nose, + gai, joyous, ornament.]

   "My nosegays are for captives;
   Dim, long-expectant eyes,
   Fingers denied the plucking,
   Patient till paradise.

   "To such, if they should whisper
   Of morning and the moor,
   They bear no other errand,
   And I, no other prayer."
   Emily Dickinson.

This week's theme: words from poetry.

............................................................................
The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a
thousandfold. -Aristotle, philosopher (384-322 B.C.)

>  Just a few tips for Christmas eating.
>
>
>         We all know that the true meaning of Christmas is not crass
>     Commercialism  -- but few realize how important food is. So here are
> some tips
> On Holiday eating:
>
>         1.) About those carrot sticks:  Avoid them. Anyone who puts
>  carrots on  a  holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas
> spirit. In
> fact, if  you  see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door where they are
> serving rum balls.
>
>         2.) Drink as much eggnog as you can ...and quickly (I
> recommend A&E, the king of eggnog). Like fine scotch, it is rare. You
> can't find
> it any other  time of the year but now. So drink up. Who cares that it has
> 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to turn into an
>  eggnogaholic or something. It is a treat. Have one for me. It's later
> than you
> think.  It's Christmas.
>
>         3.) If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole
> point of gravy. Gravy does not stand alone, it is one of the basic food
>  groups.
>     Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill it
> With  gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat!
>
>         4.) Speaking of mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made
> with skim milk or whole milk. I won't even mention the dreaded
> instant ones.  If it is not whole milk, pass. Why bother? It's like buying
> sports
> car with  an  automatic transmission.
>
>         5.) Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to
> control your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to
> eat other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?
>
>         6.) Under no circumstance should you exercise between now and New
> Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do.
>   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the
> buffet
> Table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.
>
>         7.) If you come across something really good at a buffet table,
>     like frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa,
>  position yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can
> before becoming  the   center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair
> of shoes. You
>  can't leave  them behind. You're not going to see them again.
>
>         8.) Same for pies: Apple, pumpkin, mincemeat ... have a
> slice of  each (you don't want to hurt the hostess' feelings). If you
> don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin.  Always have three.
> When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day?
>
>         9.) Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded
> with the mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it all costs. I mean,
> have some standards, mate.
>
>         10.) And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you
> leave the party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying
>  Attention.
>     Reread tips. Start over.
>
>     But hurry, Cookieless January is just around the corner.

Hello everyone!  I hope all of you are doing well!  I am getting so excited
about this weekend and the Christmas shower!  Don't forget to RSVP - it is my
cousin, Josie Flesher's number (713-626-9466) and she is not there during the
day, so you can just leave a message.

Hope to see you guys this weekend!

Love, Lisa

I have received several e-mails generated by Tom Beach's and Gwen Soong's

Delete it from your system. I think many of the GIR parties may get this

Dan,

I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing 
with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of 
Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts 
seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I 
wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather 
than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me 
know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is 
limited up here).

Thanks,
Susan

Griselda (gri-ZEL-duh) noun

   1. A woman of exemplary meekness and patience.

   2. A female given name: from a Germanic word meaning `gray battle.'

[Def. 1 after a character in a tale of the same name in Giovanni Boccaccio's
Decameron.]

   "Whereas Rosina in `Barber' is a spitfire, all flame and sass, Cenerentola
   is a more demanding and less appealing role. She must bide her time but
   persuade her audience and her Prince that she's more than a patient
   Griselda who deserves happiness and redemption.
   Willard Spiegelman, Opera: Cinderella is a ball, The Wall Street Journal,
   Nov 2, 1995.

This week's theme: fictional characters who live on in the dictionary.

With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.

WHITE (LABEL) XMAS:  With our special White Label fares, flexible travelers 
can save up to 80 percent off published airfares this holiday travel season!  
When you opt for a White Label fare, you will not learn airline and flight 
specifics until after you purchase your tickets. (This protects our major 
airlines from tipping off the competition!) But you'll land a great flight 
for your requested itinerary and save much-needed cash for fruitcakes, party 
hats and stocking stuffers!

New White Label fares are added into and updated in the Farebeater system at 
http://air.onetravel.com on a daily basis. White Label flights are 
automatically offered to you when availability matches your requested 
itinerary. Currently OneTravel.com offers thousands of White Label flights, 
in conjunction with 8 million consolidator airfares and over 20 million 
regular published fares -- but number of White Label fares in the system 
depends on availability from the airlines.

Here's how to search for White Label availability:
? Click to http://www.onetravel.com.
? Search flights for any dates -- even New Year's Eve!
? Wait for Farebeater to locate an initial fare.
? Now click on Farebeater Ultra for White Label fare options.
? Farebeater will offer White Label fares if they match your city pair 
selection.
? Book and save!

HOLIDAY HUMOR: Holiday travel taxes our nerves, frustrates our good 
intentions and tires us out -- but it also brings us together with loved ones 
and gives us a few good stories to tell.  We're looking for a few humorous 
stories to remind people to relax during the hectic holiday travel season and 
hear the ha-ha-ha's amidst the ho-ho-ho's.  Do you have a favorite holiday 
travel memory that might bring a smile to our readers' faces?  An airport 
foible, a road-trip mishap, a holiday lesson learned?  Send your submissions 
to editor@onetravel.com by December 22, 2000. (Please restrict the length of 
your story to 250 words.)

Selected entries will appear in upcoming holiday newsletters, and winners 
will receive a OneTravel.com t-shirt in a size big enough for Santa or small 
enough for his helpers.

BABES IN PARIS: Nickelodeon and Rugrats bring you and your family a chance to 
win
a trip for four to Paris, France, including hotel, airfare and $50,000!  
Contest entry is somewhat involved and requires several small expenditures, 
but if you've got a couple of Rugrats fans on your hands, you might end up 
buying these promotional items anyway.  Contest ends January 15, 2001, but 
requires preparation. Click to

THE TURKEYS TALK AGAIN - Holiday tips from the OneTravel.com Experts

Holiday travel is arduous at best, but some planning and mental programming 
can save your sanity. Our OneTravel.com Experts, Nancy Zebrick and Bob Jones, 
offer some tips and general advice which we hope will help you pass through 
your gates in great physical and mental shape.

Statistically speaking, airplane travel is the safest way to get from one 
point on the globe to another.  Yet some travelers still step onto the plane 
with fear.  It may not be easy to overcome this trepidation, but as Nancy 
explains, it's best not to self-medicate with in-flight cocktails.

Alcohol triples its effect in flight and causes serious dehydration, says 
Nancy. Skip it and drink lots of water; 32 ounces for a long hour flight is 
not unusual. Try to keep to your normal eating schedule while in flight and 
bear in mind these rules of thumb:

1) High-fiber carbohydrates seem to have better effect than fats and even
protein in keeping the amount of air that is produced through digestion to a 
minimum. Fruit and yogurt are good sources of carbohydrates and vitamins; 
consider packing some for the first leg of your flight.

2) Eat small portions to ensure proper digestion.

3) Avoid salty foods!  They can bloat you and cause your feet to swell.

5) Forget carbonated beverages -- the gas expands at high altitude. Fruit and 
vegetable juices are better alternatives. Also avoid tea and coffee, as they 
are
both diuretics and can dehydrate you even more.

6) Always bring a bottle of water with you. The airline may run out.

Once you reach your arrival city, adjust your eating schedule a bit to comply 
with the time change.


Anytime you sit in one place for over an hour, especially at high altitude, 
your body experiences problems. You may notice swelling in your lower legs 
and feet as your circulation is reduced.  Veteran flyer Bob Jones offers tips 
to solve your in-flight woes:

Try the two-step method. First, wear support hose on long flights and second, 
step. Step out of your seat and walk the aisles. If you cannot get up and 
move about, do your best to stretch and move your legs as much as possible.  
For those in the over-50 group, it is also very important to move the rest of 
your body. Simple shoulder shrugs and neck rotation along with arm and back 
stretching will do wonders for your well-being. Some basic isometrics or just 
shifting your position in your seat helps. Bottom line is this, if you sit 
still for three or four hours, it will take its toll as you get up to leave 
the airplane.

Stretch before, during and after the trip. Elevate your feet if you can. 
Hydrate your skin with lotions and moisturizers to prevent dryness, says 
Nancy.  The best time to apply moisturizer is when there is still moisture in 
your pores -- so start before you board! And try to wear larger, more 
comfortable shoes at the airport and in-flight.  Because of the altitude, gas 
in the body will cause slight swelling.

If you are traveling with kids -- as Bob often does -- remember that they 
need to move, too, as well as be occupied during the flight. Kids tend to be 
able to sleep on long flights since they can curl right up and go to sleep in 
a coach seat.  And, Bob says, since they are more rested than you, try not to 
be too short with them. Always bring activities and order special "Kids 
Meals" which are now available on virtually all carriers. Activities should 
be age appropriate, and if you are bringing electronic games, make sure they 
are quiet or that the sound can be turned off. Be sure to include manual 
activities like coloring, connect-the-dots and word finders. And finally, 
even though the world is shrinking, remember to bring a favorite snack for 
the outbound and return trip.  Your kids' favorite snack may be hard to find 
in another state or country!

Congratulations! You have managed to control your mental and physiological 
stress between the gates -- and your kids are happy, too!

Happy Holidays and Happy Travels,
>From Nancy and Bob

Hi Susan,

In the attached file are the valuations on 11-1-00 for 11-1-00 for three GD 
deals,  using the tested version of PortCalc as we discussed. I did three 
deals out of the six deals you picked earlier-- basically they worked the 
same way. Let me know if you have any questions.

octopus (OK-tuh-pus) noun, plural octopuses or octopi

   1. Any of numerous carnivorous marine mollusks of the genus Octopus or
      related genera, found worldwide. The octopus has a rounded soft body,
      eight tentacles with each bearing two rows of suckers, a large
      distinct head, and a strong beaklike mouth. Also called devilfish.

   2. Something, such as a multinational corporation, that has many powerful,
      centrally controlled branches.

[New Latin Octopus, genus name, from Greek oktopous, eight-footed : okto,
eight, okto(u) + pous, foot.]

   "Wipro may be a diversified octopus but the strongest arm of the
   cephalopod is software."
   Sumit Mitra, et al, Software: Cyber Zars, India Today, Mar 15, 1999.

This week's theme: animal words that are used figuratively.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

Susan,

 I just spoke to Mary Klyasheff at People's Energy.  She is ok with all 
changes except State of Texas.  She has suggested New York as a neutral 
state.  Seeing that Enovate is a joint venture between ENA and People's, can 
we accept New York law on their guaranty.

 Give me your thoughts.

Thanks,
Ted

Susan,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by Peoples Energy Corp 
(PEC).  PEC and ENA will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted

Hey!  How are all of you doing?  Everything's going well with us.  Farrell 
and I
went home for Thanksgiving.  It was our first time back home since the 
wedding.
It was kinda strange because since we live nearby each other, we had to decide
whos house we were going to stay at and when.  Oh the joys of being married 
and
having to split your time between the families!  It was good to see his mom
because we hadn't seen her since she started her chemo treatments.  She's 
doing
well - she's pretty much lost all of her hair, but she is now getting some of
her strength back.  She goes back to Houston next week for her fourth 
treatment
and they'll do a sonogram to see how the tumor is doing.  She will most likely
have a mastectomy in the next few months, and then we'll just go from there.
We also drove up to Austin last Thursday night for the game of Friday - GO
HORNS!!  What a fun game that was!  I had been debating on whether or not I 
was
going to go because I had surgery the Thursday before (tonsillectomy - YUK!!)
It was hard to not be able to scream after we scored touchdown after 
touchdown!!
I saw a lot of our pledge sisters at the game - Lindsay, Erica, Stacey, etc. I
was kinda out of it, though, because I was on a lot of pain medication, so 
they
probably thought I was nuts!
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure I have all of your correct addresses.  
Corey
and Susan, do y'all still live in the same places?  And Elizabeth, I think
you've moved, so can you just email me your address again?
Thanks!!  Y'all write back and let me know what's been going on with all of 
you!
Love,
Steph

As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the 
negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the 
tariff max rate.   Please note that the first two transactions are already 
public and the following information can be disclosed now.  The third deal 
has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.  That filing will 
be made before Dec. 1, 2000. 

General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's 
maximum tariff rate.  Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated 
rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.  (Order issued April 11, 1997, 
Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021).  Pursuant to that authority, 
TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed 
at Docket No. RP97-288.  Details on the specific transactions are as follows:
  
Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  ITS-1
 Volume:    30,000/day
 Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000
 Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool
 Delivery point:  SoCal Topock

Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000 
and rate is $.75/MMBtu  

Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  LFT
 Volume:  10,000/day
 Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000
 Receipt point:  Bloomfield
 Delivery point:  PG&E Topock

All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these 
transactions.  No other information is available as TW does not comment on 
specific customer transactions.

This week's theme: words from the German language.

Western Markets Disconnect
The western energy markets are currently in a pricing
crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system
blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and
spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy
headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific
corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the
South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during
December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through
the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong
power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage
levels have combined to intensify the demand for
pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity
bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.
The result is prices that dramatically "disconnected"
from the rest of the North American gas market in a way
that is more typical of Northeast markets during the
winter.

The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as
the demand drivers combined with weakened storage
inventories will maintain price pressure on western
price points throughout the winter. However, the recent
jumps in western gas market differentials-to more than a
$10 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub-should ease
somewhat with a break in the weather. Under any weather
scenario, spikes up into the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu
range will be a feature of winter markets along the West
Coast. On balance, we expect West Coast price
differentials to average at a $4.00-$8.00 per MMBtu
premium through winter. The spring hydroelectric runoff
season should offer the first opportunity for a break in
differentials that could drop back to more typical
levels of less than $1.00 per MMBtu.

Over the long term, increased pipeline capacity and
additional gas supply are needed to break the
vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes.
However, significant new capacity additions are still 12
to 24 months away. In the meantime-particularly this
winter-sustained high and volatile price differentials
and extremely high absolute prices at western points are
likely to draw the increased attention of state
regulators and the FERC, as winter heating demand
exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the
crisis.

Building Up to the Price Spike
The first signs of natural gas price spikes and
disconnects emerged this summer, as sharp year-over-year
increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to
new highs. As pipeline capacity constraints into
California became evident, differentials in Southern
California moved up to a $1.00 per MMBtu premium to the
Henry Hub. These extremely high prices, as well as low
forward spreads, discouraged storage injections through
the summer. As a result, a strong storage position early
in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through
July. In August a lateral on El Paso's southern system
exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity
into California for a two-week period. During that time,
the market drew heavily on storage inventories and
further weakened storage positions. As hydroelectric
generation declined through the summer, the price
strength extended into Northern California. Malin, which
had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the
summer, began trading at a $0.50 per MMBtu premium to
the Henry Hub in September. The summer and early fall
market set the stage for continued and more intense
spikes this winter. The following factors are now
driving this market:

* Continuing surges in gas demand. Gas demand levels
have remained high since early summer, driven by higher
overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric
output. Demand levels for the third quarter in the US
West averaged 10.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up
from 8.7 Bcf per day during the third quarter 1999.
Persistently strong gas-fired generation production
through the fall months diverted gas to power
production, frustrating efforts to fill storage. This
pressure will continue. The year-over-year demand
increases from the power sector will be compounded, as
evidenced in November, by swings upward in residential
and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet
(MMcf) per day. Overall, CERA expects nearly 1.6 Bcf per
day of increased demand in the West this winter, with
the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions
showing 1.2 Bcf per day of increased demand. Key power
sector drivers, including the strong economy, colder
weather, and lower hydroelectric generation, will
continue to push gas-fired generation.

* Pipeline utilization nears capacity. Strong western
demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western
pipes to high levels. Flows from British Columbia into
the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels
since summer, while flows from the Rockies on Northwest
have remained at pipeline capacity. Flows on PGT into
Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity, although
approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess capacity exists
on PGT into California at Malin. Likewise, flows out of
the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently
remained at capacity. The only slack pipeline capacity
remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on
Southwest pipes. During the past few months, these
pipelines have operated at their highest utilization
rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early
last decade. The high utilization of western pipeline
capacity-reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints
that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the
West this summer-leaves very little slack capacity to
provide a relief valve for demand spikes. And that is
exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks
(see Figure 1). Given the level of storage inventories
and expected gas demand, flows on the El Paso and
Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher
flow levels from December through March than they have
averaged through November.

* Deteriorating storage position. At the start of
November California storage inventories held at 154 Bcf,
a full 32 Bcf below the five-year average inventory
level. The strong in-state withdrawals during November
weakened that position to 128 Bcf; the deficit swelled
to 62 Bcf. Inventories in California have never fallen
below 60 Bcf, so deliverability through the end of
winter is likely less than 700 MMcf per day. Storage
inventories in California are so low that utilities'
ability to balance withdrawals from storage with
purchases from demand-sensitive price points is severely
limited. If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid-
December materializes, this effort at balance will be
even further compromised for the remainder of winter
(see Figure 2).

* Short-term contracting. A significant amount of
western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market.
A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline
capacity to spot transactions-in many cases in response
to gas and power industry deregulation-has left the West
much more exposed to spot market volatility. In other
areas of the country, utilities have significant firm
pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the
citygate and/or have forward purchased gas (at previous
and lower prices) for at least some portion of their
winter supplies. As a result, unlike in eastern markets,
a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of
California utilities will be exposed to the current
price spikes.

* No alternatives. A lack of fuel-switching capability
prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas
prices. Power prices continue to move in lockstep with
the increase in gas prices. Not surprisingly, gas prices
pushed the cost of gas-fired generation beyond the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) proposed
price cap of $150 per megawatt-hour, setting the stage
for a reassessment of this price limit. A small and
declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel
capable. Significantly, air emissions restrictions-
already plaguing power markets with much higher
emissions credit costs this year-will make any further
switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California
market highly unlikely this winter. A recent meeting of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which
has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area, concluded
with no relief granted to generators running short of
emissions credits.

Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November
The first cold weather-related demand spike demonstrated
the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability
of the western markets. A cold weather system in mid-
November brought temperatures averaging 47 percent
colder than normal-the temperatures actually averaged 14
percent colder than a normal January week-and provided
the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery
systems on the West Coast. Capacity constraints on
moving gas into California that appeared during the
summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as
heating loads climbed. This core demand compounded the
effects of continued strong demand for gas for power
generation.

The high power demand was the result of the intersection
of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and
a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power
plant outages. Gas demand in the US West during the last
two weeks of November was boosted to approximately 15.5
Bcf per day, driven by heating demand increases of 2.8
Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage-
related demand increases of 1.0 Bcf per day.

These demand spikes caused buyers-already dependent on
the spot market-to bid citygate prices to record high
levels through the last two weeks of November and into
December. Since demand outstripped supply, prices rose
dramatically at all western price points, and flows of
natural gas to western markets increased over high
summer levels. Citygate prices surged beyond $40.00 per
MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $15.00
per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock. Daily spot gas
prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many
western market regions.

West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter
Although the week of November 13 could prove to be the
peak demand week in the West this winter, CERA does not
expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West
Coast any time soon. Storage inventories are so low that
the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage
withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities.
Generators, which already rely heavily on the spot
market for supplies, are faced with a bidding war for
scarce supplies. Colder-than-normal weather would likely
keep West Coast prices in the $20.00-$40.00 per MMBtu
range. More normal weather would allow a slow decline
from current levels of over $20.00 per MMBtu down into
the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu range. However, the storage
situation and underlying demand strength mean that any
return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early
January.

This winter will prove a critical test for western gas
markets, and the end of the heating season will likely
provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in
the West Coast market. As heating loads diminish
significantly in March and storage deliverability is no
longer a critical issue, premiums should retreat back
into the $1.00-$2.00 per MMBtu range. As hydroelectric
generation begins to increase, the pressure could
subside even further, but storage injections during the
spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines
even during the spring.

The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest
The West Coast price pressure is not limited to
California. High demand in the Pacific Northwest (and
more indirectly in California) will keep upward pressure
on prices from Sumas to Stanfield. Northwest pipeline
capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at
the onset of the cold weather and even so can only
provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest. The
combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed
Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are
bidirectional there. The only supply source for the load
centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in
northern Pacific Northwest (such as Seattle) are from
Westcoast at Sumas. The Westcoast mainline from the
producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also
been operating at capacity. The same bidding forces felt
in California have been evident at these western
Canadian price points, pushing Sumas prices into the
$20s per MMBtu. These forces will persist, keeping Sumas
at a premium to AECO over the winter-and in much closer
relationship to California prices.

Customer Response:  Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire
With power plants and gas utilities paying the current
high spot prices, consumers' bills from Vancouver to San
Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity
prices. The gas industry has been preparing for rate
shock this winter, warning regulators and customers
alike. However, the price spikes in the West and the
sustained premiums in western markets move beyond
alarming. Capacity holders are reaping significant
rewards for their investments in capacity positions,
resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from
consumers to capacity holders. Market power and market
gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will
find easy application in their gas market counterpart
(no matter what their merits). Some level of
investigation into the natural gas markets during or
following this challenging winter should be expected. As
has occurred in the power markets, this will now turn
attention to gas purchasing practices, particularly in
California. The likely outcome of this process will be a
shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases
toward a more flexible portfolio approach.

Subject: FERC Sets Implementation Date for GISB Version 1.4 Standards


Yesterday, FERC issued Order No. 587-M which incorporates the most recent 
version of the GISB standards, Version 1.4 and directs the pipelines to 
implement the standards by May, 1, 2001.    Version 1.4  include the 
standards for implementing Internet web sites (which pipelines were already 
required to implement on June 1, 2000); critical notices, and multi-tier 
allocations.  Pipelines are required to make filings to incorporate these 
standards into their tariffs not less than 30 days prior to May 1, 2001.

Order 587-M also discusses the fact that GISB was unable to adopt consensus 
standards for cross-contract ranking.  Pipelines were willing to move to a 
process of confirming on an entity to entity basis, but the LDCs and 
producers also wanted to require pipelines to provide detailed confirmation 
data to working interest owners and downstream parties.
The Commission determined that it did not have sufficient information to rule 
on this issue.  Accordingly, the Commission directed staff to convene a 
technical conference to discuss cross-contract ranking.

There's a typo on my vacation.  It's no biggie, but I just wanted to let you

get a bunch more corrections.

Susan,

I tried to explain the pricing formula in non-technical format. 
Take a look the doc attached below, to see if this is good
enough for the lawyers.

RE: Re: Korea


Great pic! I miss you guys. Just got a new type rating in the GV so that
is like a huge big weight off my shoulders. I hate check rides but I did
OK on this one. My new plane gets delivered in August of next year so I
have a ways to wait but it should be worth it. The damn thing can stay
in the air for 14 hours! A crew just flew one from Beijing to Memphis
non-stop. I don't know if I can sit there that long. I flew the F-5
today for the first time in a month and can you believe it everything
worked except the pilot. It has turned into a reliable little jet and is
a blast to fly. Today was one of those days when you could see both
coasts, it was really nice being up there in my single seater. It will
be me and the F-5 now for around 8 months because we sold the GIV,
something about making payments on a GV and a GIV was pretty horrific
and Gulfstream conveniently (for them) makes you pay for the new plane
when it comes off of the production line. Then you wait 8 months while
they put the interior in. This is the first new plane that I have ever
owned so I am excited. I got to watch them mate the wing the other day
which was quite a thrill. I got a video. No kids so I can bore people
with my GV memorabilia! How's Kath and Suze? I was getting an irregular
email from Suze for a while but I haven't heard from her from her in a
while, must take after her dad. Give me a call when next you are in Ft.
Lauderdale. 305-798-3559. Cheers.......JR

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

Hi, Sooz!  How are you feeling?  Is the tree still in one piece?

Went to the doc this a.m. and he says my lungs sound clear.  I'm to continue
using an expectorant for 10 more days and get an x-ray Wed.  He's ok'd my
trip to Calif, but no skiing.  We had already decided that.  Probably keep
our reservation at River Ranch and least for a couple of nights though.  So,
if all continues to go well, I'll leave on the 8th.

I don't know for sure if Mother has a whirlpool but there's something in the
back of my mind that thinks she does.  I haven't been thinking much about her
except I know she wants some tights--queensize.  Have been concentrating on
you and K, J, & G. and am doing pretty well.  I figure if I get everything
bought for all of you, then when I come back, I'll have plenty of time to
worry about her.

love, mum

Subject: Keystone Unit Regrout & Ovehaul

Marketing has approved the regrout and overhaul for one of the recip units.  
This is contingent upon a completion date.  Marketing was hoping for 
completion by the end of December.  However, discussions with Engineering 
indicate 7 - 8 weeks for the overhaul and regrout.  By copy of this letter I 
am requested Marketing to approve or disapprove the Keystone work even though 
it will take through January for completion.

Thanks,

Ron M.

I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued 
that imbalances should not be dollar valued before netting and trading are 
available, but that strikes me as an industry wid e policy issue and not a TW 
specific issue.  Any other thoughts?  DF

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Certainly.  You might also be interested to know that I spoke at length tod=
ay=20
with Lad Lorenz, and like most parties to this proceeding, SoCal Gas is=20
awfully tired of this fight.  Lad doesn't expect that SoCal will file any=
=20
sort of substantive challenge to the CPUC's decision.  Of course, SoCal, wi=
ll=20
ultimately have the lead in writing the tariff sheets which implement the=
=20
features of the settlement.  I told him that, most likely, TW will monitor=
=20
the implementation phase of the proceeding but was probably not going to=20
mount any serious challenge to the CPUC's decision.

Subject: Proposed Decision

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=
ers=01, ability to=20
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=
=20
announced
daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;
=01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations;
=01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru=
m for=20
more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
=01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar=
e intended to=20
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
=01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon=
thly=20
imbalance
tolerance;
=01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci=
ng rules=20
and penalties
as all other shippers;
=01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig=
n and=20
reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20
board set up
for it;
=01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex=
ceeding=20
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=
sts.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=
=20
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=
=20
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =
=01&Rather=20
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-
ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market. Additionally, w=
e=20
unbundle core
interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume=
r=20
protection legisla-
tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core=20
aggregation programs.=018
The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and=
=20
other restruc-
turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain=
=20
benefits do not outweigh
the costs to most ratepayers.=018

All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be=
=20
discussed. The
draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC=01,s Dec. 21 meeting=
.=20

prosopopeia also prosopopoeia (pruh-so-puh-PEE-uh) noun

   1. A figure of speech in which an absent or imaginary person is
      represented as speaking.

   2. A figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are
      endowed with human qualities or are represented as possessing human
      form. Personification.

[Latin prosopopoeia, from Greek prosopopoiia : prosopon, face, mask,
dramatic character : pros-, pros- + opon, face (from ops, eye) + poiein,
to make.]

   "This is not theft, but kidnapping, summoning, prosopopoeia. In Eliot's
   earlier poem we still have one foot in another poet's hell. Here, Dante
   is summoned to the City of London, his lines marauded, his inferno woven
   within another of Eliot's own making."
   Joseph Dinunzio, Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909-1917,
   The Review of English Studies, Aug 1998.

This week's theme: words from the world of literature.

.............................................................................
This grand show is eternal. It is always sunrise somewhere: the dew is never
all dried at once: a shower is forever falling, vapor is ever rising. Eternal
sunrise, eternal sunset, eternal dawn and gloaming, on sea and continents and

explorer, and writer (1838-1914)

position is the same as being valuated on Oct-31-2000, as with the case of 
Nov-3 vs. Nov- 2.

Enron talking points....


Factors Leading to Higher Natural Gas Prices this Winter

? Demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power 
generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming 
economy.

? Natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low 
prices that reached far below $2 per MMBtu.  In 2000, deliverability 
utilization will be over 95 percent.

? While drilling activity has risen sharply (as much as 50% from last year), 
the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not 
available for several months.  According to the AGA, supply production 
continues to run 16% below last year's levels.

? The past three winters have been "warmer than normal" winters in the 
Midwest and much of the United States and Canada, artificially masking the 
usual consumption of natural gas under "normal" weather situations. 

? Very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand 
increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby 
competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices 
upward.

? U.S. storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from 
the past six years, according to the AGA.  The cost of storage inventory at 
this summer's strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally 
experienced in the winter.

? Other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing 
significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than 
last.

Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices

There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill 
can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) 
of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman 
(D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas 
prices. 

The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. 
Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry 
and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. 

"Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a 
price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu," said Murkowski. "We are concerned about 
both price and availability of supply as we move into the winter months."

Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political 
winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also 
agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make 
trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the 
most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under 
NGA section 4/5.  To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" 
theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc.  I'll talk to 
you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss.  
Thanks.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch 
with her.? I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a 
refundable deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so 
logistically switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be 
worth asking.? Remember I have water covered.? Call or e-mail if you have 
questions!

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.  I do not feel they diminsh
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you
would expect.  They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural
events at the end of the letter.  If this gets them on the letter, I say
let's sign.  I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the
letter unless I hear differently from you by 3 pm today.  I really
appreciate the quick turnaround.  Mike Day

cataract (KAT-uh-rakt) noun

   1. A large or high waterfall.

   2. A great downpour; a deluge.

   3. Opacity of the lens or capsule of the eye, causing impairment of
      vision or blindness.

[Middle English cataracte, from Old French, from Latin cataracta, from Greek
katarraktes, kataraktes, probably from katarassein, to dash down : kat-,
kata-, cata- + arassein, to strike.]

   "The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep
   No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
   I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
   The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep."
   William Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
   Early Childhood.

Have you seen the poem about a little girl who, with a lantern in her hands,
goes out in a snowstorm to light the path of her mother coming back from
town? Later, her parents go out to look for her, following her footprints in
the snow when we discover, "And further there were none!" My heart skipped a
beat when I came across those five words. I'm talking about Lucy Gray, a poem
by William Wordsworth ( http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww158.html ), that I read
in my early school days. Later, the emphasis on math and science, and
subsequent studies of computer science in college and grad school, blotted
out the world of poetry. I forgot the name of the poet and other details of
the poem but it has been haunting me ever since. Recently, while researching
some words, I came across the poem again and realized it had never really
left me. Does a poem ever do?

What is it in poetry that moves us so much? Perhaps it is a reminder that no
matter how tough, and worldly-wise we may or try to be, deep inside all of us
have the heart of a child. In this week's AWAD, I'll present words from some
of my favorite poets. Why don't you email me (anu@wordsmith.org ) about your
favorite poets and their poems?                                        -Anu

albatross (AL-buh-tros) noun, plural albatross or albatrosses

   1. Any of several large, web-footed birds constituting the family
      Diomedeidae, chiefly of the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, and
      having a hooked beak and long, narrow wings.

   2. A constant, worrisome burden. An obstacle to success.

[Probably alteration (influenced by Latin albus, white), of alcatras,
pelican, from Portuguese, or Spanish alcatraz, from Arabic al-gattas : al,
the + gattas, white-tailed sea eagle. Sense 2, after the albatross in The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which the mariner
killed and had to wear around his neck as a penance.]

   "Getting the albatross that is Temelin off its neck would make the
   utility more attractive to future investors."
   Tony Wesolowsky, Fueling up fast, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
   Sep/Oct 2000.

  Water, water, every where,
  Nor any drop to drink.

Ever wondered where these well-known lines came from? They are from a work
that is the origin of the figurative use of today's word: The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner, a poem by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first
published in 1798.

In this vivid poem, a mariner and his crew are traveling in a ship near the
South Pole. For no reason, the mariner kills an albatross flying above his
vessel.

   'God save thee, ancient Mariner!
   From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--
   Why look'st thou so?'--'With my cross-bow
   I shot the Albatross.'

His shooting down of the innocent bird brings a curse to the ship, and his
shipmates throw the carcass of the dead bird around his neck, thus giving
a powerful idiom to the English language.

   Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
   Had I from old and young!
   Instead of the cross, the Albatross
   About my neck was hung.

Much happens in the rest of the poem and the whole crew, except the mariner,
dies. As a penance, the wizened mariner wanders, recounting his tale and
wisdom.

   He prayeth best, who loveth best
   All things both great and small;
   For the dear God who loveth us,
   He made and loveth all.

During the rest of this week, we will see more animal words that are used
figuratively.                                                        -Anu

Subject: ocker

Seeing the word ocker reminds me of a story told by a friend. It took place
during the Australian air traffic controllers' strike of the 1980s, when
interstate travellers were desperate for any form of airborne transport and
all the light planes were full.

My friend's father was one of the people who tried to hitch a ride on a
light plane. He rushed up to the steward--about to close the plane doors,
and asked breathlessly whether there was any room, only to be answered with
the immortal line: "Sorry, ocker, the Fokker's chocker."

I'd thought that the word "ocker" had been around since before TV, and it
turned out I was only partly wrong. According to the Australian National
University's web site: http://www.anu.edu.au/ANDC/Austwords/ocker.html, (and
how could you disagree with a source named ANU?), "Ocker" has a longer
history as a nickname in Australia for anyone with the personal name Oscar
or Horace, or with the surname Stevens, just as "Blue" is the nickname often
given to people with red hair. I'd wager that the character in the Mavis
Bramston Show (1963-68) was known by a nickname because a bloke like Ocker
would hardly ever be known by his real name - especially if it was Horace.

Never occurred to me before this -- the heir to the French throne was the
dolphin, while the heir to the British is the Prince of Whales. Nothing
fishy at all about that -- mammally, perhaps.

Subject: Diverging Languages

UK: I'll give you a ring
US: I'll call you.

UK: The number is engaged
US: The number is busy

Of course this leads to some interesting puns in British English that don't
work in US English ("I'll give you a ring unless your engaged" has two
meanings in UK English but only one in US English).

Subject: English vs. American

I was married to an Englishman during the 1960s. I had no idea what he
wanted when he asked for a bobbin of cotton. (He meant a spool of thread.)

Also, at first he would promise to "knock me up in the morning" -- which he
thought meant he would come by to wake me up.

Subject: variations of English

This discussion regarding the different meanings of American English and
English English reminds me of an experience in a London restaurant several
years ago . I was in the company of my wife and two middle aged American
ladies. Upon the completion of our very good meal {In England yet} one of
the ladies in a loud voice stated "I feel really stuffed". Upon observing
amused glances from our fellow diners perhaps imaginary on my part, I
suggested to her that being "stuffed" in England had a much different
connotation than being satiated with food.

Subject: pronunciation

Many years ago, while living as an American houseguest in the north of
England, my host offered to take me to the "lakeshore". This confused me,
since there was no lake nearby, and my hosts didn't drive a car. Instead,
we walked downtown to a ramshackle building, and walked up three flights of
stairs to ... a leek show. The British are fanatical gardeners, and love to
show off their talents. Also on display were tomatoes, onions and many kinds
of flowers. But the event was known throughout the community as the leek show.

Subject: Language is changing

Just as British English differs from American English, I find this true with
other languages, too. In Spain a car is called a `coche' and a coach or cart
is called a `carro'. In the Americas a car is called a `carro' and a coach
is called a `coche'. There are several other words that have opposite and
different meanings depending upon the country, yet they all speak Spanish.
Language is changing constantly and those changes do not always occur
concurrently within the global community.

From: Kathryn Flueck (kflueck@birgeminckley.com)
Subject: Re: British English

Is it too late to comment about differences between American and British
English? I have seen nothing on one of the most colorful aspects of British
English -- Cockney rhyming slang (perhaps because it is considered somewhat
lower class, although it has been around for more than a hundred years and
some of the terms have crept into more common usage, clearly no pun
intended). The theory is it was started as a code language. The idea was
to use a phrase, usually two words, the second of which rhymes with the word
one wants to use, then often the rhyming word is dropped off, making the
statement impossible to understand unless one knows the term. Thus, "apples
and pears" rhymes with "stairs," so if one asks where a particular room or
thing is, one might be told it is "up the apples." "Use your loaf," means
"Use your head," for loaf of bread rhymes with head. Once I fixed scrambled
eggs for some Cockney friends, and was asked if I had any rocking horse. I
was at a total loss, of course. Turned out they were asking for ketchup,
which the English call sauce, and in Cockney English, horse and sauce rhyme
("hoase" and "soace"). For those interested, I highly recommend the book
Cockney Rabbit, by Ray Puxley. Rabbit stands for talk. The phrase is "rabbit
and pork," and in Cockney English, "pork" and "talk" rhyme ("poke" and
"toke")!

Subject: Palindromes

I know it's not the current topic, and it's related to computer languages
just as strongly as to English, still I thought maybe you'd appreciate this:

There's a contest for abusing the C programming language, the International
Obfuscated C Code Contest (www.ioccc.org). One of my favourite people who
regularly participate is Brian Westley. One of his programs is completely
symmetric (each line is a palindrome): http://www.ioccc.org/1987/westley.c

Maybe you think this has nothing to do with English. Maybe this'll help you
change your mind: http://www.ioccc.org/1990/westley.c

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering, but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

raisonneur (rez-uh-NUR) noun

   A character in a play, novel, or the like who voices the central theme,
   philosophy, or point of view of the work.

[From French: literally, one who reasons or argues, equivalent to
raisonn(er) to reason, argue + -eur.]

   "The Fool in King Lear is the apotheosis of the ironic commentator, the
   raisonneur who sees through the world's follies and the blunders of its
   leaders."
   A Clown is not a Fool, The New Straits Times, Jul 8, 1998.

Lindy, your example is correct for settling operator imbalances.  If we have 
a payable operator imbalance
and we settle volumetrically, then we get fuel and transport.  But, I thought 
the "netting and trading" in Order 637
was on Shipper imbalances only.  I am not sure what we mean by "no additional 
cost, etc" mentioned below.
I'll call you in the morning (Thursday) to discuss further,  since I am not 
familiar with the PNM protest.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject: Re: TW  

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

my vote is for the 22nd- there is a good chance that if we were to plan this 
business on the 19th, we would need to bring a cot for me, since approx 
8:30pm will still be feeling like waaaaay past my bedtime- and NO ONE wants 
me to be subdued, do they (ok, don't answer that.? who else will take it upon 
themselves to be embarassingly drunk, perhaps vomiting on the curb.....except 
laura- oh- wait- that's the trash can!?? just kidding laura- couldn't resist, 
plus, it was nice to have a 'partner in crime'.....jen, kk, other spectacular 
vomiters, you are included as well.? you non-hangover, happy-go-lucky at 8 am 
people make me sick....literally.....)? god, am i rambling?? a little loopy- 
too many papers, too little time. i was also going to throw out las alamedas 
as a suggestion or ousies's table.? any thoughts?? i don't think ANY of us 
have been there for grp things.....can't wait to see everyone!?

Subject: Behavioral Profile of Risk Management Personnel

I want to recap our understanding of the key cultural/behavioral attributes 
that you said were important to interview for.      If you want to add to 
this please don't hesitate to do so.   We will form a questionnaire tailored 
to your group's needs. 

The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with 
new situations on a constant day to day basis.   This person would become 
bored and restless with routine.   This person would also enjoy learning at a 
relatively fast and voluminous rate. 
The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and 
can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted.   There 
are techniques as well as questions that can address this. 
The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, 
follow-through, and persistence.   They must be equipped with an ability to 
cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done.    
They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.    It is difficult 
for the candidate to create a story that combines examples of all of these 
traits unless it truly happened.   If they have these traits, they have used 
them in the past. 
Relatively thick skinned.   How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands?   
A desire to be in control of situations is also a desirable trait.  These 
applicants must want to make decisions and control outcomes almost all of the 
time.   Not to be confused with micro-managers or control freaks 
(yeah-buts).   
Lastly, they must have an entrepreneurial focus.    They need to be the 
people that make it happen, with possibilities but without guarantees  of 
personal gain, a desire to take ultimate responsibility, and influence others 
to get it done and make them feel good about it.   The how, what, when, 
where, and why of being in a leadership role. 

We will start formulating the questions and the order in which they should be 
asked today.   Do you have any candidates in the near future?   We would be 
glad to help you with interviewing tips.   
hgm

Loving my new place and my roommate is so much fun and so wonderful....How 
are you doing?? last i heard you were juggling several men- i'd love to hear 
more!? are you taking off any time around Christmas?? I'm not, so I'll be 
here the whole time.....i've already wrapped my Christmas presents!? my goal

Hey Julie,

Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more
than earned it).

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,? your new apartment/roommate
and Brendan are all doing.? All are wonderful I hope.? I realize this is
somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San
Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend
of Dec. 15?? I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally
understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.? Regardless, this
deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it
doesn't look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe 
could make a visit mid-January or February.

Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Susan

Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Mike,

The version of this that you sent out forgot the ".com" on Joe Paul's
address.  I forwarded a copy of it to him, but we want to correct it in
future forwardings, etc. of this letter.

to CSA Letter





Here are some edits to our letter from socal.  I do not feel they diminsh
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you
would expect.  They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural
events at the end of the letter.  If this gets them on the letter, I say
let's sign.  I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the
letter unless I hear differently from you by 3 pm today.  I really
appreciate the quick turnaround.  Mike Day

Mike,
Here are SoCal's proposed revisions to the CSA letter - I'll call in a
minute.  The edits are pretty extensive, but all along the lines we
discussed (ie changing the tone to a more positive one).

Hi Susan,

I changed the code so that it feeds the Ostrip model as Larry (?) requested 
by using the formula to derive BasisOffset. In the attached file is the 
comparison between the old valuation and the one after the modification. 
Please not the changes on the premiums. Please let me know if you or Larry 
have any questions/comments on this.

Susan,

Attached in the file are the testing results.

 Also you can run a script file to test more PID/deals if you'd like . This 
script file uses my modified version of PORTCALC, and  is on  UNIX,:
  ~stang/port_calc_test.csh you can go to my home  directory  ~stang, then 
type port_calc_test.csh PID and run it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.


Zimin



Paulo,

Can you add a flag to xcol function so that we can choose a put or call from 
the
spreadsheet ?

Thanks.

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

dreary (DRIR-ee) adjective

   1. Dismal; bleak.

   2. Boring; dull.

[Middle English dreri, bloody, frightened, sad, from Old English dreorig,
bloody, sad, from dreor, gore.]

   "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
   Where knowledge is free
   Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
   By narrow domestic walls
   Where words come out from the depth of truth
   Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
   Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
   Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
   Where the mind is led forward by thee
   Into ever-widening thought and action
   Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake."
   Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali.

Subject: Max rate issue on TW

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=
=20
recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=
=20
2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=
ck=20
of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20
market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in=
=20
TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=
=20
price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20
possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20
request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20
showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds=
=20
all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=
=20
the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01("firm transportation" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=
oses=20
we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20
Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=
ther=20
pipelines are a "good substitute" only if shippers can obtain the same=20
quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=
=20
service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20
10%.  All relevant "origin markets" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=
=20
as well as "destination markets," and alternatives for shippers in those=20
markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=
=20
if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=
=20
used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=
=20
alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20
quantity.

3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20
competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=
=20
factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.=
 =20
Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point a=
nd=20
delivery point.  HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share and=
=20
squaring it.  There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation=
=20
services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities.

4.  Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues.

white elephant (hwyt EL-uh-fent) noun

   1. A possession unwanted by the owner but difficult to dispose of.

   2. A possession entailing great expense out of proportion to its
      usefulness or value to the owner.

   3. An abnormally whitish or pale elephant, usually found in Thailand;
      an albino elephant.

[From the perhaps apocryphal tale that the King of Siam would award a
disagreeable courtier a white elephant, the upkeep of which would ruin the
courtier.]

   "Now an orchestra opening a new hall has reason to pray, solemnly and at
   length, that it will not be saddled with a white elephant with mediocre
   acoustics."
   Allan Kozinn, A Venerable Concert Hall That's the Belle of the Ball,
   The New York Times, Sep 30, 2000.

This week's theme: animal words that are used figuratively.

Sorry to hear you're suffering.  I'm flexible on this and can go ahead or
reschedule.  I really would like for all of us to be able to sit down
together and discuss pending matters.  I would be happy to set the lunch
back to later in the week if that works for all.  As things look now, Thurs.
or Fri. lunch are open.

Sorry but I am not going to be able to make it to lunch today.  Whatever
bug I had last week has gotten worse and I certainly would not want to
expose any of you to this.  It is fine with me if you want to meet without
me, or we can reschedule for later this week.

Kindest regards,
Susan

Jeff,
Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to "stay in the loop" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  

It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.

This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks

As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.

Julia, 
I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, 
she is copied on this e-mail.  Let me know if you have any changes to this 
approach.

Thanks Jeff, ETS Operations would be glad to look at these and any other 
"potential" opportunity to operate 3rd party facilities. Don Hawkins is 
heading up the "endless possibilities" for us. I did copy him on this reply, 
Don is based in Houston. 

I 'am currently in Amarillo Texas with the SW Operation Directors and I will 
discuss this with Rich.

THANKS for the partnership.

		 Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Sorry I haven't responded Laura.? The 19th is bad for me because I won't be 
finished with finals, and it sounds like everyone can't make it then anyway.? 
My vote is for the? 22nd, 8:30pm, and Benji's.? 

I look forward to seeing everyone, especially since the last time I saw 
several of you was not a good time for me.? 
See you girls then, Ashley

PARTIES:

This is a reminder that PG&E will host a Gas Accord II Settlement Workshop
next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.  Please note, the
workshops will start promptly at 9:00 a.m. each day, and end around 4:00
p.m.  Among other things, these slightly longer sessions allow time for
feedback from the parties.  With this earlier start, we will provide a
continental breakfast as well as lunch on both days.  The Workshop will be
held at PG&E's headquarters, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.  We will be in
Conference Room 308 on Tuesday, and Conference Room 300 on Wednesday.

Please RSVP to Darcy Morrison, at e-mail D2Mr@pge.com, or by telephone at
(415) 973-6644, so that we can get a head-count for the meals.

Attached below is our proposed agenda for the November 7-8 Workshop.  The
topics include:  demand-supply forecast, supply reliability, capital cost
forecast, and backbone direct connection and local transmission rate design
options.  Although these subjects have been discussed at prior workshops,
our objective is to present additional detail and analysis so we can all
wrestle with some key issues and begin to formulate possible solutions.

Also, as we discussed at the last Workshop, we have set aside two hours at
the end of each day for observations and feedback from the parties.  Along
with the issues list, this will help PG&E to put together a proposal that
seeks to balance the many competing interests.

This is our last scheduled Workshop before we send out our first version of
a settlement proposal.  Our target date for this proposal remains December
8.

We look forward to seeing you next week.  Please call or E-mail us if you
have any questions or suggestions.

             A Compendium of Feedback on the Words in A.Word.A.Day
             and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages

--------------------------------

From: Hans Feuss (hans.feuss@cibc.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--aufklarung

I am now 54 years of age, but during my youth the word 'aufklaerung' (note
the umlaut here), had a very specific meaning:

Having received 'aufklaerung' or having been 'aufgeklaert' ALWAYS meant,
that your parents/elders etc. have told you, not necessarily taught you,
the ways of the birds and bees and how babies were made. I suppose, this is
a form of enlightenment, but not necessarily in the way it was presented.

   Also noted by Pamela Matsuda-Dunn (pmdart@aol.com) and Raul Cucalon
   (cucalonr@pom-emh1.army.mil).

--------------------------------

From: Quincy Liu (liu@hmi.de)
Subject: Anschluss

Before the word Anschluss became encrusted with the political overtone of
`being taken over', it had, and still has, the straight forward meaning of
`having connection to', e.g., by knowing a certain contact person one has
the Anschluss to an organization or a group.

--------------------------------

From: Eric Wilson (cerebrumconsulting@home.com)
Subject: Succinct definition of kitsch

Some years back on a BBC radio program called 'My Work', I heard the most
succinct definition of 'kitsch'.

kitsch: "A Venus de Milo statue with a clock its belly."

Says it all, don't you agree?

--------------------------------

From: Randall Gray (randall.gray@marine.csiro.au)
Subject: A.Word.A.Day--kitsch

We were discussing what someone ought to wear to a moderately formal
function when a voice from the rabble piped up:

       "Remember: Kitsch never goes out of style."

It is now on the wall in our loo along with a motley collection of other
similar aphorisms both humourous and wise.

--------------------------------

From: Gretta Small (grettasmall@cs.com)
Subject: Spelling

Why have you chosen to OMIT the umlaut in "gemutlichkeit" (your spelling)
rather than to observe the convention (using an "e" following the
ought-to-be umlauted character to indicate the umlaut) normally observed
when the umlauted character is not available on the keyboard? This is done
even in Germany. Thus, the word would be spelled, "Gemuetlichkeit."

The umlauted "u" has a completely different pronunciation from the
non-umlauted "u" and thus is absolutely essential. I lived in Germany for
many years and learned this the hard way, e.g. "schwuel" (WITH the umlaut)
means "humid" and "schwul" means "homosexual."

--------------------------------

From: Rudolph Chelminski (rudychelminski@compuserve.com)
Subject: Re: German words

I have received a multitude of complaints that the German words I selected
for AWAD as a Guest Wordsmith were missing umlauts and were not capitalized,
as is standard German practice for nouns. Two explanations for this: 1) Many
(most?) American keyboards, mine included, do not have the umlaut symbol;
and 2) once German (or Hindi or Afghan or whatever) words have been
kidnapped into our language they are no longer 100% what they were. Now that
we have them in captivity they have to play by OUR rules, heh,heh,heh. So no
accents, umlauts, diacritical marks or whatever. And no capitalizations.

--------------------------------

From: Mark Willis (mwillis@helix.nih.gov)
Subject: Fifteen minutes of fame for "chad"!

I've been enjoying your AWAD mailings for over a year now, and every once in
awhile I see in print a word I had recently learned from the daily morsels
you send. But I doubt if any newly-learned word so far has appeared as
prominently to me as the term "chad" (AWAD, 11/3/99). For the past six days,
the election of the president in the United States has been (literally and
figuratively) hinging on the chads attached in various conditions to the
manually-punched ballots in the state of Florida, as election officials
examine them for hints of the voters' electoral intent. When I originally
saw `chad' on your list, I wondered why we needed a name for such an item.
Now I realize that every word will have its fifteen minutes of fame!

Whenever I see or hear the word (which the news media often stop to define
before proceeding with the story), I think of AWAD. Thank you for doing your
part to inform our electoral process here in the United States.

   For those who missed it first time around, the word chad is available at
   http://wordsmith.org/words/chad.html . If you wish to see the theme under
   which it appeared and the entire week's words, check out the
   archives for Nov 1999 at http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives.html -Anu

--------------------------------

From: Brian West (brianwest@clara.net)
Subject: Slang

I have with much interest read the correspondence on English rhyming slang.
This reminds me of an alternative slang used on occasion by my late Father,
and allegedly by Butchers in England where words were reversed, thus eson was
nose, ecaf (esaf) was face and so forth.  Quite difficult to understand until
acquainted with the rules.

--------------------------------

From: Suzy (suzy807Q@aol.com)
Subject: speaking backwards

Since most people who subscribe to AWAD are linguaphiles, I would expect
that many have a facility with languages in general. I'm wondering how
common the ability to speak backwards is. (For example, one could instantly
translate while speaking "Hello, my name is John" into "Olleh, ym eman si
Nhoj.") I can do it and I've only met one other person who could do it as
well. Is this a fairly common ability?

Hello girls!

I was talking with "on-the-ball" Ayres last night and we were discussing the
bridesmaid's luncheon.  I was thinking a good time would be Friday for a late
lunch (around 1:00).  That would be late enough for morning flights to arrive
and still give us enough time for the rehersal dinner.  But, I want to make 
sure
this fits with your schedules because we can always have it on Saturday.  On
Saturday I had planned for us to go get our nails done and hair (optional) but
we can flip flop the days if some of you will not be able to get off on 
Friday,
etc.

So, let me know what you think and what your schedule allows!

Hope all is well with you guys!!!!

Love you,
Lisa

Subject: put on collar



I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.


Zimin



Paulo,

Can you add a flag to xcol function so that we can choose a put or call from 
the
spreadsheet ?

Thanks.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their 
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp 
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce 
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. 
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to 
shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were 
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel 
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San 
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow 
new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies 
last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to 
solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, 
they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical 
problem and into a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single 
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a 
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief 
executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the 
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  "You 
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of 
industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In 
California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, 
and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating 
plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the 
older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't 
like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they 
burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power  
plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short 
of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including 
many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair 
after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to 
begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and 
not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because 
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last 
summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of 
gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices 
also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal 
units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% 
from a year ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based 
on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In 
California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the 
price a year earlier.

Susan-

Doug has been on my computer for the past two days finishing his thesis, so
I haven't been able to write back.

Well-- if nothing else, at least you can practice your witty repartee with
him.  Did he write back?  That non-conference opponent excuse was lame.
Exactly who were the non-conference opponents--Rice, SMU, Slippery Rock...
Hmmm.  We need a little more information to give that credibility.

I have been studying like a nerd lately, so hopefully, finals won't be so
stressful this year.  I keep remebering that we gave that shower right
before my finals last semester.  That comforts me-- I know wasn't prepared
for any of them at that time and class had already ended.

Anyway, I just had a 15 minute conversation with the Time Warner Cable guy--
I called to pay my bill because I lost the paper copy-- first, he looked at
my address, saw it was near Hyde Park Bar and Grill-- and preceded to
disucss all of the wonderful menu items-- french fries, Reuben sandwich,
iced tea-- then I gave him my credit card number and he asked me if it was a
USAA card-- apparently you can tell by the first 4 digits-- 5416-- who knew?
  We talked about how great USAA is for 5 minutes.  Then he asked me if I
was in school in Austin-- so we talked about that...  When he finally
finsihed with me, I thought he was going to ask me out.  If it weren't for
Doug, I would have gone- he was quite a nice guy.

Anyway, it was refreshing considering how many idiots, jerks, assholes, etc.
work in the service industry.

Well, let me know what's going on.

Talk to you later.

-Corey

Girls-
Thank you for the responses.  So far it has been overwhelmingly
positive!  I really can't wait to get us all together.  Emily had
suggested Ousies's Table-as well as a coworker of mine.  Yesterday
during our lunch break we went and looked at Ousies's and it seems
pretty cute.  Unfortunately they were not open, but I heard they light
it up at night and it is supposed to be really pretty.  The other
suggestion is Benji's.  Lis-you made a good point.  It would be nice to
try somewhere new.
I have not heard from Sarah or Kelly-so if you talk to them-please pass
them the message.  I know Kelly usually checks her email, but I am not
sure about Sarah.  If anyone has a number for her-let me know.  I also
haven't heard from Susan Scott-so Lisa- you are in charge of that.
Ashley-I know you've gotten this message-so reply!  : )
Corinne-Sorry that you will not be able to make it. : (  If anything
changes-let us know.
Jen's flight comes in around 7 that night-so I thought we would make the
reservations for 8-830 so she has time to make it.
Let me know what ya'll think.
-Laura

Regulatory doesn't have any issues except internal accounting of the revenue

whether that would require or limit our ability to operate.   MK

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Mark's synopsis pretty well says it all.  Once again, the CPUC is in a panic 
and is attempting to change the rules in the middle of the game.  I'm not 
sure I can make as clear a connection as Mark has between the actions of 
interstate pipelines, particularly Transwestern, who, basically, are allowed 
to charge just a tariff rate for upstream transport, and the huge dislocation 
of basis spread between producing area and California border.  Therefore, I 
don't necessarily see us being sullied by the El Paso issue.  I think our 
biggest PR problem is probably our affiliation with Enron Online.

We'll continue to monitor this situation.  One thing is clear... fireworks 
will certainly be forthcoming when the QF's are being paid on a formula 
weighted predominantly with basin pricing, rather than border prices.  Not to 
be be too esoteric here, but remember, there are a number of factors at 
play.  QF's by contract are obligated to produce electricity when called on. 
They are paid capacity payments by the utilities for that purpose.  It will 
be interesting to see how many of the QF's tell Edison, PG&E, SDG&E, et al. 
to go "fly a kite" when they know that if they produce a MW of electricity, 
their commodity payments will put them under water.

Notice - Section 390



Team,  thought you would find this somewhat interesting  
and?explanatory?of?California's  near? term panic . Our  California 
Commission? is predisposed to do almost anything to stem the  tide of higher 
energy prices. Their latest manifestation of complete melt-down  comes in the 
form of attempting to modify electric QF payments by abandoning the  current 
gas index methodology utilized by all three utilities. Essentially, the  
proposed decision would?immediately (effective 12/1) abandon the old  
California border gas indexes in favor of adopting a "proxy gas price".?  
This new proxy gas price would apply to all three utilities, PG&E, SCE and  
SDG&E. On a temporary basis, the gas index used for eventual electric QF  
payments will be an gas index consisting of? ( i ) 10 % of the simple  
average of three border indices at Topock ( Btu Daily, NGI, Natural Gas 
Week)  and? (ii ) 90% of the SoCal Gas Core Wacog published monthly in 
Schedule  G-CS or (in the case of PG&E) 90 % of their core published WACOG .? 
The  resultant reduction in electric QF payments is several hundreds of 
Millions of  dollars just for? December alone.
?
So  what if anything does this mean to TW ?? Clearly, TW's short term desk  
maybe be affected. If Cal border numbers run 14 - 20 dollars and power 
payments  are based upon PG&E Wacog of $7.50 gas demand for electric 
generation  will? moderate. Next, the heat level on the cause of why basin to 
border  price spreads are over $10 is not longer just a Commission vs.. EPNG 
issue. The  entire California QF population becomes a huge stakeholder. The 
never ending  search for a "bad Guy" escalates. TW needs to be careful?from 
becoming  painted with a broad brush. TW is not one of the Southwest bad 
Guys. TW's pipe  is not oversold, is point to point firm, widely held, useful 
to California's  utilities etc.
?
If any  of this is useful and you want to further explore to potential 
ramifications,  please call .? Mark, IGS
?

aufklarung (OUF-klay-roong) noun

   The Enlightenment.

[German : auf, up (from Middle High German uf, from Old High German.) +
Klarung, a making clear, from klaren, to make clear, from Middle High German
klaeren, from klar, clear, from Latin clarus.]

   "The idea that a profanity, especially one that was used as more than a
   casual expletive, could be used as a - pardon - legitimate verb was to me
   something of an Aufklarung, an enlightenment."
   Jon Hahn, A Deposit From Mr. Ed Pays Garden Dividends, Seattle Post -
   Intelligencer, Oct 26, 1999.

If memory serves me right, Caesar described the Germanii as a large, hardy,
ferocious people who inhabited the gloomy forests to the east of Gaul, wore
hardly any clothes and were perpetually on the move. Well, if he were able to
have a look around the seashores of Spain, Portugal or Italy today, he might
say exactly the same thing, although this time around the context would be
rather more peaceable. The descendents of those redoubtable forest-dwelling
savages are probably the world's number-one travelers today, still gripped by
an extraordinary wanderlust that sends them to the four corners of the earth
in apparent flight from the serious, orderly and slightly boring society they
have constructed for themselves in their geopolitical sandwich between the
Latins to the west and the Slavs to the east. The Germans have done a lot of
fighting and a lot of thinking about that sandwich over the centuries since
Caesar reported on them, and the words that have entered the English language
from their experience frequently reflect those military and intellectual
struggles: they are light on things like play, gastronomy, fashion and
frivolity but top heavy in philosophy, political thought and struggle in
general: serious, consequential stuff. If these words tend to be a little
ponderous and hard to pronounce, they are marvelously apt expressions of what
could never be expressed so well if our English tongue just minded its own
business and never wandered abroad to steal from others.         -Rudolph
Chelminski (rudychelminski@compuserve.com)

Men are men before they are lawyers, or physicians, or merchants, or

themselves capable and sensible lawyers or physicians. -John Stuart Mill,
philosopher and economist (1806-1873)

Walter Mitty (wol-tuhr MIT-ee) noun

   An ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic
   daydreams of personal triumphs.

[After the main character in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by
James Thurber.]

   "The men you see rolling over the zoysia at 5 miles per hour are
   pretending to be Mario Andretti at Indianapolis. Nothing draws
   Walter Mitty from a soul like the sound of a riding lawn mower
   engine."
   Rheta Grimsley Johnson, Roar of the mower helps build a woman's psyche,
   The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, May 1, 1998.

One of the most important ingredients of fiction is its characters. Think
of any memorable book, play or movie and you'll recall its people--from
protagonist (and deuteragonist and tritagonist and ...) to antagonist are
folks one can feel, relate to, though not necessarily always agree with.
These are the people with depths, they are not cardboard characters or
people who live a 2D life, to use the publishing jargon. These multifaceted
people come alive on the pages of a book, on the stage of a theater, or on
the screen of a movie theater with all their foibles, follies and victories.
Perhaps the ultimate sign of their character is that they live on on the
pages of dictionaries. This week's AWAD focuses on a few of these fictional
persons who came alive and added a bit more color to our language.     -Anu

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ=
e
to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

I would like to see us try to re-insert words to the effect that if the 
Commission throws out the CSA after haranguing the parties to reach an 
agreement, it will seriously discourage future settlement efforts by parties. 
That is not a deal-breaker for me, just a suggestion. Otherwise the comments 
are fine.

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.? I do not feel they diminsh 
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you 
would expect.? They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural 
events at the end of the letter.? If this gets them on the letter, I say

Mike, 
Here are SoCal's proposed revisions to the CSA letter - I'll call in a 
minute.? The edits are pretty extensive, but all along the lines we 
discussed (ie changing the tone to a more positive one).

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Tom Beach received the navidad virus in e-mail  yesterday, and it replicated 
itself and went out to many (maybe all) of the  people who had sent him 
e-mail that he had not yet opened (i.e., unopened mail  in his Outlook 
Express in-box).
?
Because the OII and peaking rate filings were  yesterday, you probably sent 
Tom e-mail that he didn't have a chance to look  at.? If you have a firewall 
system that rejects any e-mail with executable  files attached, you're safe.? 
If you don't, here is the URL with the virus  cure:
?
http://www.fsecure.com/v-descs/navidad.htm
?
In Tom's system, I was able to ignore the error  message about the machine 
not being able to find "winsvrc.exe," open  his Internet browser, and 
download the virus repair file from this Web  site.? It's a relatively easy 
fix once that's done.
?
I'm terribly sorry about this.? Let me know  if I can be of further 
assistance.

So good to get your email.... I am sorry to hear that you're so busy with
work... yuck!  Things have been crazy at our office too but nothing compared
to your hours!  I was there until 9:30 last night getting together a
proposal for Richard to take to D.C. today to bid on the Texas Delegation's
Presidential Inaugural Ball.... I hope we get it but it's not for sure.

I would LOVE to grab a drink or coffee sometime soon... you let me know.  I
will be gone from the 25th until the 30th but then I'm back and not going
anywhere!

Hang in there my dear... we sure did miss you Monday but know you are needed
there.... keep me updated and we will get together soon!

Love you,

Jen

Transport Options - In response to our recent FERC filing, a technical 
conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001.  

Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d 
of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the 
market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000.  We 
expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll 
likely reset the hedge at higher numbers.

PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this 
week.  They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to 
us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however 
disagrees.  Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place 
but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing.  As their 
volume increases, their rates go down.  In addition, we added a seasonal IT 
rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements.

Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque 
region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the 
local utility.  If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a 
combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new 
delivery lateral off TW's mainline.  Part of the deal structure may include a 
volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.  Next step for 
TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios.  
Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15.

Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the 
Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service.  The 
big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas 
to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for 
Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the 
Grand Canyon.  This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the 
least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES 
(70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose 
a large export market for their coal.  ENA has agreed to approach AES on this 
project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power 
plant are complete.  Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are 
limitations on the pipe usage.  

Burlington Claim - We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of 
the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims 
adjusters.    This will be combined with the total operations costs.

Agustin,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Susan

Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.

TRIPPLER'S REPORTS: Baggage must be checked at the airport prior to flight 
departure -- but how early?  Some airlines dictate specific time ranges 
during which baggage must be checked in order for it to be loaded on the same 
flight as the passenger.  Others do not.  OneTravel.com Airline Expert Terry 
Trippler reviews the rules and restrictions in his latest edition of "Airline 
News."  Click to

MR. MAXIMILER: Our newest column from OneTravel.com's own Frugalist, Bob
Jones, features up-to-the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles 
and save you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

How to get the most miles out of your flying:

1) Identify your likes and dislikes and pick a carrier/alliance to meet those 
needs.  Once you have a carrier, they will do their best to keep you through 
various promotions and coupons.  Stick with that carrier/alliance even though 
you might find that another airline beats them by $10.  This can become a 
"penny wise, pound foolish" situation if you are trying to achieve elite 
status, which brings with it additional "free" miles.

2) Join any discount programs for which you qualify or programs like NWA.com 
Club for further discounts.

3) Consider alternative airports served by your alliance whenever you can.  
This can save you hundreds of dollars for a drive of just an hour or so.

4) Since you are working with an alliance, check the other airline partners.  
That is, if you see Continental flights on Onetravel.com, they may actually 
be flights operated by Northwest.  You buy a ticket on Continental from 
Onetravel.com and end up flying on your primary carrier, Northwest.  This 
practice is called code sharing.

5) Consider open jaw and circle routes instead of two one-way or two 
roundtrip tickets.  Use rail travel on the open portions of these types of 
tickets if you can, and remember that you can earn miles on a few rail routes 
depending on your carrier.

6) If you do fly four to six roundtrips per year on your carrier/alliance, it 
is quite possible to achieve elite status which brings with it additional 
miles and that wonder of wonders, the first class upgrade.

7) But most of all, in order to get the most benefit from leisure travel and 
the best price as well, be flexible when you travel.

Next week, tips for picking your hotel and rental car partners wisely.

Happy Contrails,
Bob "Mr. Maximiler" Jones

Hangover Classification

1 Star Hangover:
 No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere
 disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be  glad
 that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still
parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even
vegetarians are craving a steakbomb and a side of gravy fries from any
truck stop USA.

2 Star Hangover:
No pain. Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you =
chug
to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which =
is craving rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. =
Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a =
nice demeanor about the office, you are costing your employer valuable =
money because all you really can handle is surfing internet porn and =
writing junk e-mails.

3 Star Hangover:
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space shot
and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her =
perfume
reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends =
after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now =
if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching =
the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 =
Snapples and a liter of diet coke- yet you haven't peed once.

4 Star Hangover:
Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or
else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being
late and has given you a lecture for wreaking of booze. You wore nice
clothes but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial
spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while
riding the bumper cars) your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like
one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76. You would shoot your mother for one =
or all
of the following: 1. The clock to strike 6pm. 2. The entire appetizer =
list from      TGIFridays or 3. A time machine so you could go back and =
NOT have gone out the night before.

5 Star Hangover:
aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell. You have a second heartbeat in your
head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next
cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy.
You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from
brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva
so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the =
last
of the moisture left in your body. Death seems pretty good right now. =
Your
boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog
just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick
because let's face it, all you can manage to do is bitch about your =
state-
which is a mystery to you because you definitely don't remember who you =
were
with,  where you were, what you drank and why there is a stranger still
sleeping in your bed, unaccompanied, at your house. The only thing you =
can do is
smoke a bong hit and pass out. It's when you wake up a few hours later
with a lesser star hangover that you eat a large pizza, an order of Kung =
Pao
Chicken, a ham and cheese omelet and a batch of rice krispie treats.

hysteron proteron (HIS-tuh-ron PROT-uh-ron) noun

   1. A figure of speech in which the natural or rational order of its
      terms is reversed, as in bred and born instead of born and bred.

   2. The logical fallacy of assuming as true and using as a premise
      a proposition that is yet to be proved.

[Late Latin, from Greek husteron proteron, latter first : husteron, neuter
sing. of husteros, latter, later + proteron, neuter sing. of proteros,
former.]

   "Intriguingly linked with this imprecision is the hysteron proteron of
   line 6, whose uncertain sequence of bearing arms, and then learning their
   use opens more space between the two acts than it closes."
   Bruce Danner, Courteous virtu in Spenser's Book 6 of 'The Faerie Queene.'
   Studies in English Literature, Winter 1998.

I will be getting in town at 7pm on Friday the 22nd.  I would love to go to
dinner, so if you make reservations for that night I can probably make it
around 8pm.  If everyone else can't do it on the 22nd, then I hope to see
you all sometime before I head back to California.

Dear Tennis Terminators,
Just a reminder, we are having our end of the season party Tuesday night at 
La Griglia - 2002 West Gray.  The reservation is for 7:00 but come early and 
meet in the bar for drinks.  Also, please RSVP so I can get another count.  A 
lot can happen in a week, especially with all the sick people around.  Lets 
make it a girls night out!

Vanessa

P.S.  I need to have the spring roster in by Dec 28th!  So confirm that you 
are playing next year and give me the names of anyone else we can add.  Even 
names for subs would be great, just make sure they are an HTA member.

Oooh, "venue." I like it.  The 24th is good with me.  How about either
Pappadeaux or Pappasito or anything else around the Kirby/59 area?  Should
take you guys the same amount of time getting out of downtown.   11:30? (to
beat the lunch crowd).

Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.

Susan,

I go this email as well.  Unfortunately, I've been busy as well and didn't
really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can
understand our roles/duties/functions a little better (hey, aren't we both
pretty big clients of a certain Houston law firm? -- hint, hint, Charles  :
)

Does anyone know this person or his organization?  Is this something our

about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.

Subject:  24th IAEE International Conference




About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

HI Susan-

I'm totally open to whatever works best for you, truly.? That would be fun to 
have all day Saturday, and I'm really not worried about leaving you a key 
under the door mat or waking up to greet you- we can work it out.? Whenever 
you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me, too.? I'm not doing much to help 
you make a decision, I know, but I want you to do whatever is easiest and 
most comfortable for you.? I remember you having to get up at the crack of 
smack to come out here on Saturday; sometimes it's easiest to stay up later 
rather than getting up earlier!? I have virtually no plans that weekend now, 
so I'll start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekend....We 
should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter, too, since we didn't get to do 
that last time.? We'll plan on Saturday evening for that.? I'll gather some 
friends....

Hope you're having a good day!
Julie

Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving

no way I could make that one because of? work.? The other option is to fly
in Saturday morning like I did last time.? I'm leaning towards leaving
Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind
waking up to let me in.? That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things
and I wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave
around 6:00).? Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the
various options?? Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

I was asked whether TW could install a stand-by compressor unit at the Gallup 
station in the event the unit was down due to scheduled or unscheduled 
maintenance.  

All interstate pipelines with a blanket certificate are authorized to 
install, operate, and remove "temporary" compression provided the temporary 
facilities are not used to increase the volume or service above that rendered 
by existing permanent unit(s). Temporary compression installed under this 
authority can only be used when permanent horsepower is down for scheduled or 
unscheduled maintenance.  I have reviewed this issue with legal and we agree 
that stand-by compression would qualify under the "temporary compression" 
regulations.

This authorization is restricted to the cost limitations of the automatic 
blanket certificate of $7.3MM in 2000 (this includes the costs to acquire the 
unit).   The cost limits under the blanket certificate are increased each 
year.  Generally, the new limits are published in February an increase 
approx. $100,000 each year).  Further, the certificate requires that the 
"temporary facilities" meet a 55 dBA Ldn noise standard.

Please coordinate the installation of any temporary compression with the 
certificate department .  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  
Thanks MW

Susan, you asked about Texas during our telephone conversation.  I should 
mention that Texas has a statute that prohibits demanding or selling at an 
excessive price such things as fuel, food and medicine if the Governor has 
declared a disaster, which I assumed didn't fit our scenario.  I didn't see 
anything in the Texas case law but it was a quick look.

I like the idea of all girls and Secret Santa, but the other would be fun
too.  It might be fun to do a potluck dinner at someone's apartment and do a
gift exchange.  I am not sure of my finals schedule yet, so I do not know
which night would be best for me.  I am not picky though.

Lorraine,
I am filling the position that Darin Aucoin vacated this week.  I will be
your contact for the Transwestern and El Paso Field Services interconnect
currently being negotiated.  Attached is a redline version of the
Operational Balance Agreement which has been reviewed by EPFS' legal
department.  There are a few questions I have that we need to discuss at
your earliest convenience.  You can reach me at 713-420-7338.

Thank you Lorraine and I look forward to working with you soon.

Mike,

Edison can deal with the letter, either in it's pre-SoCalGas modified form,
or with the SoCalGas edited letter.   Unless you hear otherwise from us,
consider us signatories (using Doug Porter's name).

However, I do agree with Michael Rochman that the SoCalGas version's
comments on point five are a bit weaker than I would like.  It is more than
a matter of having to duplicate the effort already expended, it is also a
matter of having to justify that level of effort in light of a diminished
perception (at least) of the chances of implementation of the results of
that effort.  I would prefer that be indicated politely, but clearly.

to CSA Letter





I would like to see us try to re-insert words to the effect that if the
Commission throws out the CSA after haranguing the parties to reach an
agreement, it will seriously discourage future settlement efforts by
parties. That is not a deal-breaker for me, just a suggestion. Otherwise
the comments are fine.

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.  I do not feel they diminsh
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you
would expect.  They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural

events at the end of the letter.  If this gets them on the letter, I say
let's sign.  I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the
letter unless I hear differently from you by 3 pm today.  I really
appreciate the quick turnaround.  Mike Day

Mike,
Here are SoCal's proposed revisions to the CSA letter - I'll call in a
minute.  The edits are pretty extensive, but all along the lines we
discussed (ie changing the tone to a more positive one).

THE TURKEYS TALK - Holiday tips from the OneTravel.com Experts

Holiday travel is arduous at best but some planning and mental programming=
=20
can save your sanity.

By now, you have your tickets for Thanksgiving travel (unless you are going=
=20
to travel on Thanksgiving Day) and should be booking soon if you are=20
traveling over the Hanukkah, Christmas or New Year's holidays.  This done,=
=20
consider the following tips as your travel travails begin.  We all agree th=
at=20
the easiest way to make holiday travel better is to be flexible and keep a=
=20
positive mental attitude.  While the latter may be hard at times, just step=
=20
back and take a deep breath.  Confrontation will only make things get worse=
. =20
You can always be "right" later.

1) Packing and pre-shipping ideas:

With a bit of planning, you can travel with just one wheeled carry-on and a=
=20
small carry-on bag for an overnighter or a two-week trip.  No lost luggage,=
=20
no mis-routed or stolen bags.  And if you miss a connection, you can rebook=
=20
and hop on another plane with all of your baggage in tow. For extra comfort=
,=20
replace your shoulder bag strap with a padded golf bag strap, or consider=
=20
using a backpack with two straps to balance the weight evenly. Feet can=20
suffer during travel, so make sure to wear your most comfortable shoes to t=
he=20
airport.

Visualize your luggage as a box full of air;  all you need to do is fill up
the air spaces in the most compressed manner.  Rolling or folding and
overlapping clothes works best.  Place socks and underwear into shoes, and=
=20
fill every available space.  Miniaturize your toiletries by pouring small=
=20
amounts of shampoos, lotions and other necessities into re-usable plastic=
=20
travel bottles; you can pack these in a fraction of the space. Pack only=20
wardrobe essentials.  Plan to dress in neutrals -- tans, grays, blacks, wit=
h=20
some white or accent color -- for versatility and saved space!  Pack with=
=20
plastic bags to keep clothes from wrinkling.

If you are taking Christmas gifts or a special Thanksgiving dinner treat,=
=20
consider UPS, Airborne, FedEx and the like.  The items will arrive ahead of=
=20
you, and there's no chance of them being crushed in the overhead bin by=20
someone who doesn't know what's inside!

If kids are part of your entourage, make sure that they pack their own smal=
l=20
bag of carry-on toys and games to keep them occupied.  Pack snacks and a=20
surprise in your carry-on for them as well. When traveling with children,=
=20
travel early with your longest leg over their nap time.  The "white noise" =
of=20
the plane, train or family car will lull them to sleep and give you a chanc=
e=20
to catch your breath as well.

Most airlines have increased their charges for pets in the cabin and baggag=
e=20
hold. It may cost you between $150 and $300 to take your pet along for the=
=20
holidays.  Consider a kennel stay, or have a neighbor care for your pet whi=
le=20
you are gone.  Travel, especially by air, can be very traumatic for your pe=
t.


2) Getting to the airport or train:

Strongly consider public transportation such as a taxi or an airport=20
shuttle.  If a friend owes you a favor, now is the time to cash it in.  The=
=20
airport lots will be full, and if you don't allow enough time, you may pani=
c=20
while you circle the lot looking for a spot.


3) At the airport:

The Air Transport Association is expecting record numbers of travelers this=
=20
Thanksgiving holiday. Even with these numbers, there are things you can do =
to=20
help make your trip as hassle-free as possible.

Plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your scheduled=20
departure. Leave for the airport early enough to allow extra time for=20
increased airport traffic, parking trouble and longer luggage check-in and=
=20
security screening lines.  With most airfares, you can stand by for an=20
earlier or later same-day flight, so if you are at the airport early, there=
=20
is always a chance you can get out of town on an earlier flight. Note: If y=
ou=20
do not have advance seat assignments, you may want to arrive at the airport=
=20
even earlier.

Make sure all baggage has your name on the outside. If you do not have a=20
baggage identification tag, the airline will provide you with one.

Have your photo identification ready for the agent at check-in.

Although most airline rules read that they may cancel your reservation if y=
ou=20
are not at the departure gate ready to board at least 10 minutes before=20
departure, don=01,t press your luck.  Plan to be at the departure gate read=
y to=20
board at least 30 minutes before departure.

When it is time to board =01)- board! The plane may not move until everyone=
 is=20
seated and all carry-on baggage is stowed. Keep it simple: Board the plane,=
=20
stow your stuff, sit down and buckle your seat belt.

Although the airlines tell us that it is not necessary to reconfirm return=
=20
domestic flights, we do and we recommend you do, too.  As soon as you arriv=
e=20
at your destination, contact the airline to reconfirm your return flight an=
d=20
leave a phone number where you can be reached.

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

That filing is 17 pages long, however, I'm not able to print the last page - 
- I've tried everything!  I'm sending the first 16 pages to you via 
interoffice, and I'll have to get with tech support on Monday to find out 
about that last page. 

Susan, I put a copy of it in you in box up here.

Team,

I reviewed the Socal PD . Here are a couple of rough thoughts for possible
TW comments in favor of the CSA and rejecting the PD's adoption of the IS.

1) The PD adoption of the IS modified windowing procedure falls
substantially short of the objectives outlined by the Commission order(s)
etc. The CSA's adoption of firm Socal receipt point rights is the only means
to give both Socal endusers and their suppliers the "certainty" they have
long sought. While, the IS as modified in the PD may appear to be an
improvement in the allocation of receipt points on the Socal system, it is
only an improvement upon a fundamentally flawed system. A system dependent
upon a "daily" determination of receipt point access volumes and completely
dependent upon upstream priority systems without consideration of Socal
customers needs. Indeed, this Commission is on record about adverse impacts
on California customers resulting from chaotic upstream transportation
rules.(need to be careful about wording)
The CSA gives incumbent Socal endusers preference to Socal's receipt points
under the open season rules, while the PD continues the status quo.   etc,
etc Ref. p.128 pt 10

2) If we lose the battle, lets try to reopen the deal sooner. p.132 pt.37
The PD calls for waiting a 2 year period before a Market Assessment would be
published. Based upon the MA the Commission could institute another OII. The
argument could be made that this waiting period is simply to long given the
speed at which the industry does move. Therefore, TW could recommend that
these Market Assessments be made annually or not at all if the CSA were
adopted etc.

These items maybe of no use , if the bigger picture and battle for the CSA
does not have Socal and other party support. Have a great day! Mark, IGS

Letter looks great -- I am in the process of getting Watson's OK to sign on.
Due to all the emergencies this week, Watson is focusing its comments on the
Bilas PD on the PG&E city-gate price issue (I certainly feel duty-bound to
defend my numbers and analysis!).  Here is a draft, if anyone has time to
review it.

Confidential -- For Settlement Purposes Subject to CPUC Rule 51
ALL:

A reminder that we are still hoping to have an initial Gas Accord II
Settlement Proposal to you by Wednesday, December 20, 2000, and the we have
canceled our proposed meeting scheduled for December 13th and 14th.
However, we also must focus on the current short-term gas and electric
market situation, as we are sure you are.  Our next meeting is still
scheduled for January 10 and 11, 2001, to present our proposal and to
receive feedback from you.

As to issues, attached are two items.  One is our current version of the
issues list, and the other is a position paper provided by the Indicated
Producers.

Again, thank you for your participation in the Gas Accord II Settlement
Process.  We look forward to providing you with our initial proposal and to
our subsequent settlement discussions.  Please feel free to call us if you
have questions or concerns.

Hi Everyone,
Mark your calendars for Tasters next Thursday (Nov 16th)!!!! Julianna and I
thought it would be fun for us to meet at Downing Street around 9:45 or 10,
for drinks instead of going to dinner!  How does that sound to everyone?
Love, Ashlea

FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.

Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
of a range object is failing. The simple
fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.

Cheers.

Hi, Sooz,  Was just wondering how you're feeling.  It's getting a little
boring here and especially difficult to lay around when I keep thinking of
all I have to accomplish.  Supposed to have that pastel workshop tomorrow and
half day Sun. but don't know if I'm up to it.  Good luck with the party!
love, mum

Hello Susan--

Great idea to initiate the email correspondence--I have a huge exam tomorrow,
and then I won't have internet access until December 22nd or so, so I just
wanted to let you know that an email with more detailed information will be
coming your way soon.  After my test tomorrow, I'm leaving for the
holidays--I'm going to meet Carter's family (the boyfriend you've apparently
heard about), and then we're going skiing with a bunch of friends from med
school until the 21st, so I'll email more when I get back!!  It was great to
hear from you!!

Love,
Elizabeth

It appears that my evil twin went out last night and proceeded to get in 
peoples faces and talk a lot of smack, as well as leave messages on answering 
machines.  I've spoken with her this morning and she has been severely 
reprimanded.We have agreed on the following:

No limp bizkit for 1 week.
No consumption of alcoholic beverages on the same day that over 1/2 
million$$$ was lost trading natty.

Please forward this to anyone else she may have offended.

Edison's willingness to offer power to the "state" by contracting only with 
utilities is, in my view,  just a[nother] thinly veiled attempt by Edison to 
take advantage of a crisis situation.

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By California Energy Commission

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an
Edison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the California market," said John E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Edison International. "This CEC approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &
 Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that
California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource," Fohrer said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 California legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to California by next summer.

 Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
As
 one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy
owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in
 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,
Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the
United
 Kingdom and the United States.

 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international
electric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With
a
 portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an
industry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets
and
 power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,
Southern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison
 O&M Services.

Subject: Re: Annual Christmas Dinner








my vote is for the 22nd- there is a good chance that if we were to plan this 
business on the 19th, we would need to bring a cot for me, since approx 
8:30pm will still be feeling like waaaaay past my bedtime- and NO ONE wants 
me to be subdued, do they (ok, don't answer that.? who else will take it upon 
themselves to be embarassingly drunk, perhaps vomiting on the curb.....except 
laura- oh- wait- that's the trash can!?? just kidding laura- couldn't resist, 
plus, it was nice to have a 'partner in crime'.....jen, kk, other spectacular 
vomiters, you are included as well.? you non-hangover, happy-go-lucky at 8 am 
people make me sick....literally.....)? god, am i rambling?? a little loopy- 
too many papers, too little time. i was also going to throw out las alamedas 
as a suggestion or ousies's table.? any thoughts?? i don't think ANY of us 
have been there for grp things.....can't wait to see everyone!?

And we're coming to Houston!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Houston this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Santa Monica Civic Center then tried to find a 
turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Houston on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of North Houston. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue

Could we change the date to Tuesday, December 12th?  So far, I have two votes
for a girls party with a gift exchange.  Email me back about the new date and
your opinion on restaurant choices and type of party.

Thanks!!  Happy early Thanksgiving!

Lisa-You are so cute!!!  I love both of your fun ideas. Either one is great
with me.  Considering my man in a million miles away I may have to come
stag!!!!  As far as the date (calendar date)I am actually leaving town on
the 13th.  I know I am probably cause trouble, but if we could do it maybe
earlier that week.  I know you working folks have office parties etc. so
this might not be possible and it might be hard to get people to go out on a
Mon or Tues.  These are just my thougths!!!!!!  Can't wait to see everyone!
Sarah

hi susan-? my week is going well.? very slow, actually!? our new employee 
started monday- i need to learn to be more assertive!? he's great and really 
easy to be with, but older and has his law degree, so i have to remind myself 
not to be intimidated....

i'm looking forward to you coming to visit, too!? i sent you a couple 
brochures to your work- if you haven't gotten them then you should receive 
them any day.

what's new with you?

Subject: Re: NewCo names  

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

DJ Edison To Call For End To Calif Elec
                  Dereg Wed -Sources

                  Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.


                  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX),
saying the current state of
                  California's power markets threatens the company with
bankruptcy, will call Wednesday
                  for an end to California's four-year experiment with
deregulation, sources familiar with
                  the issue told Dow Jones Newswires.

                       John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International,
is expected to announce that
                  the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California
Edison, won't be able to
                  recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power
purchases and continue serving
                  its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market
structure is scrapped.

                       In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation,
Edison will propose to break ground
                  on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the
power-generation business
                  Southern California Edison was required to exit under the
state's landmark 1996
                  deregulation law, the sources said.

                       Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a
request with state regulators to
                  increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the
sources said, even though
                  regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase
of 10% last week.

                       The utility has lined up the support of some state
lawmakers for the broader
                  proposal, which would require action by the state
legislature, the sources said.

                       Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million
customers, is one of the country's largest
                  electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's
utilities to sign on to the deregulation
                  effort and, as it says on its Web site, "played a central
role in the restructuring of the
                  electric industry in California."

                       Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the
rate freeze, which they
                  demanded to help them recover costs related to
deregulation but which is now
                  producing huge losses.

                       Edison's current losses stem from an imbalance
between the soaring prices it must
                  pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the
fixed rate at which it can sell
                  power to its customers.

                       About half of those losses are offset the utility's
own power sales revenues, which
                  are accounted for separately and used to pay down
deregulation-related debt. Rising
                  power costs have produced a surplus in that account.
Edison wouldn't reveal the
                  current size of the surplus, but said previously that the
California Power Exchange paid
                  the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for
power through the end of September,
                  at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4
billion.

                       Power-Purchase Losses Mounting



                       The net losses continue to mount. California's
wholesale power prices hovered at
                  record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the
past two weeks, as colder
                  weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of
California's power supply was
                  down for maintenance.

                       The price of power for delivery Wednesday in
California hit an average of $1,182 a
                  megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week
ago, the result of high
                  demand and a decision by California's wholesale market
operator to lift its cap on prices.

                       The rate Southern California Edison can charge its
retail customers, however, is fixed
                  at $66/MWh.

                       Last week, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) downgraded its
ratings for Edison
                  International and PG&E Corp. (PCG), the parent of
California's other major utility, Pacific
                  Gas & Electric, to neutral, saying the utilities may be
forced to file for bankruptcy if the
                  state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.

                       A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MDW) analyst drew the
same conclusion Monday,
                  also cutting his rating to neutral.

                       Edison to this point has kept its power-purchase
losses off its earnings statement, in
                  hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow
them to be collected later.

                       The California Public Utilities Commission put the
hope of such a solution further out
                  of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate
increases sought by Edison and
                  PG&E.

                       Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its
ratings for Edison
                  International and Southern California Edison's senior
unsecured debt to the A-minus
                  level, citing "increased liquidity pressure" and
uncertainty about the utilities' ability to
                  recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency
downgraded Edison
                  International, the parent, because half its consolidated
cash flow is provided by
                  Southern California Edison.

                       Edison - which sources said plans to remain in the
retail electricity business - said
                  late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of
credit and expects to have enough
                  cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity
for the next several months.

                       California paid more than $1 billion for power last
week, sources said. Some of that,
                  however, was paid to Southern California Edison, which
still generates about 2,800
                  megawatts of power in the state.

                       Shares in Edison International have fallen 21% over
the past three weeks. They
                  closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By California Energy Commission

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an
Edison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the California market," said John E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Edison International. "This CEC approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &
 Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that
California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource," Fohrer said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 California legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to California by next summer.

 Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
As
 one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy
owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in
 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,
Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the
United
 Kingdom and the United States.

 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international
electric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With
a
 portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an
industry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets
and
 power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,
Southern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison
 O&M Services.

Susie,

Yes, you have been missed at the last couple of events!  I hear you have
your head burried in Enron.  No fun!!!!  I hope that you are getting paid
overtime or compensated in some way for all of your efforts!

Things have been going really great here - still planning for the wedding
and trying not toget too anxious and enjoy all of the engagement time!  The
shower was fun to get Christmas stuff - unfortunately, most of it is packed
up in boxes because I wanted to save it for next year (the 1st).  Some
stuff though, I just couldn't help it.  About all of this football stuff -
thank goodness the season is nearing a finale.  The weekend trips were
gettting a little intense.  We have to go to a wedding on the 29th, so not
sure what he is going to do for the game.  Supposedly Boyd is going to the
wedding too and they are going to sneak to the hotel bar to catch a
glimpse.

My family is doing great!  I just heard word that my brother is coming in
the entire week before the wedding so we can hang out and he is coming for
the engagement party!  (They recently moved to Philadelphia and are not
coming home for Christmas, so whenever I hear of him coming, I get so
excited!)

Good luck with all of your stuff - don't miss Christmas!  :o)

Love you and I miss seeing you!!!

Love, Lisa

Subject:  Hi girls...


As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron
building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and
try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to
know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your
collective lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting
and special things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a
quick note and let me know what's new in your life.

Love you guys,
Susan

Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be
crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it
well.  We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.
I'm in need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon
and you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).
Please tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls
exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA,
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set
just like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and
the "Fam".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially
your Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for
the future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).
Also, I thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to
work in your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not
completely out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through
exams as well right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite
success.

The 19th or the 22nd works for me.  

As far as restaurants go I think we should try a place that hasn't been 
blessed with our presence.  My vote is for Benji's.

see you girls soon!  hope all is well

Subject: Annual Christmas Dinner


Hi Girls!
It's that time again.  We need to get everyone together for our annual
Christmas Dinner.  I have spoken to many of you and tried to come up
with a good time for everyone.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be
a "perfect day", but how about Friday-Dec. 22nd?  Please respond and
tell me what you think.  I have had a few suggestions for a
place-Churrasco's, America's, Ruggles, Benji's, Sullivans-please send a
suggestion.  Don't say it doesn't matter because majority vote will win
and there will be no recount.  The time will probably be around 8 p.m.
I know the 22nd is close to Christmas, so the 19th has also been
suggested-but I am afraid not everyone will be in town yet.  Please send
me your thoughts on the day, restauraunt, and if we should plan
something after dinner.  I can't wait to see everyone and hope all can
make it!
-Laura

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Susan,
I'm assuming that Ms. Corman is "all over this."  I was wondering whether y=

If=20
not, may we assume that Shelley will give us a complete report on the meeti=

and FERC's next steps?

I note with curiosity the reference in the GD article to the fact that=20
parties apparently were asking whether pipelines "needed" to offer new=20
services?  Do you know the background behind this issue?  It may have some=
=20
bearing on the Transport Options filing as at least one party I believe=20
questioned why TW was even offering this new service.  In addition to the=
=20
question of affiliate relationship/behavior, the question of market power=
=20
(ie. capacity hoarding) apparently is ripe for discussion also during the=
=20
Jan. 31 meeting. =20

Do you know if we are working to prepare comments or a position paper to=20
submit to FERC by Jan. 5?

One last thing, how should we proceed with respect to coordinating the timi=
ng=20
of our technical conference on Transport Options with this pending meeting =
at=20
FERC?  Do we gain more by attempting to schedule a technical conference=20
before the FERC meeting or after?   It seems to me that if the technical=20

=20
affiliate marketing rules and/or capacity hoarding questions could easily b=

set aside pending the outcome of the FERC meeting and/or any subsequent FER=

ce=20
that the affiliate marketing rules figure so prominently in the case.  What=

do you think?

Regulatory roundup
FERC is getting ready to resume the industry dialogue on promoting=20
competitive interstate

affiliate transactions.
The meeting =01* the second in a series of three =01* is scheduled for Jan.=

Comments
and requests to participate are due by Jan. 5.

Commission staff will have their hands full with this one. At the first=20

Sept. 19, FERC tackled efforts to promote greater market liquidity followin=
g=20
the introduction
of Order 637 (GD 9/20).  The discussions were polite, but they failed to=20
yield a consensus
over the extent to which FERC needs to overhaul rate design.  Likewise, man=
y=20
in the
energy industry are not in agreement about the need for new pipeline servic=
es.
A discussion of affiliate issues promises to be more rancorous.  At the Sep=
t.=20
19 meeting,
in fact, some audience participants were eager to call attention to affilia=
te=20
problems on certain
interstate pipelines.  FERC staff, however, kept a lid on those discussions=
,=20
and did not
allow comment on any ongoing case.

On Jan. 31, the discussion will focus on =01&whether the regulatory policy =

pipeline affiliates and non-affiliates, as well as asset managers and agent=
s,=20
should be revised
to reflect the changing nature of the gas market=018 and =01&whether there =

the regulations relating to pipeline affiliates.=018

At present, affiliate relationships are governed by certain standards of=20

requirements.  But not all pipelines are subject to the same requirements,=

Susan,
Did I mention Wilson?  Coming back to Houston--never for any length given his 
love for NYC.
Yup, 6 weeks.  Mixed b/c everytime I get dug in, I get moved.  Actually, I am 
establishing a 
London base now and am happy with that but my project is on hold and I am a 
bit anxious.
The Kiwi girl sits next to me and has to commute from what seems like N 
Africa to get to work
so she is sick of the commute.  Well, that's all for now.  I will see you 
soon!  Take care of yourself--
well, I really don't worry about you over the course of a week.  We'll catch 
up and you can tell
me about your opportunities here when we get together.....Ciao.

Darren

Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and 
mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before "hope springs eternal".

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren

I would really like to go, just let me know when and where.  I went to a
Cuban resturant called Bossa tonight for Rhett's dad's birthday--it was very
nice(kinda like Churasco's or America's).  It is downtown near Cabo.  Just
an idea.

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Subject: Y'allbonics


The Association of Southern Schools has decided to pursue some of the
seemingly endless taxpayer dollar pipeline through Washington designating
Southern slang, or Y'allbonics, as a language to be taught in all Southern
schools. The following are excerpts from the Y'allbonics/English dictionary:

HEIDI - (noun) Greeting.
HIRE YEW - Complete sentence. Remainder of greeting. Usage "Heidi, Hire
yew?"
BARD - (verb) Past tense of the infinitive "to borrow." Usage "My brother
bard my pickup truck."

Mark,
Got your voice mail message.  Sorry that I haven't gotten back to you sooner, 
but Susan and I were in a meeting with our new managing director most of the 
morning.  

I finally spoke with Jeff Dasovich yesterday and he told me that Enron Corp. 
was probably not going to file comments in the case.  However, he did say 
that if/when the "letter" is distributed among the CSA parties, he'll likely 
sign on behalf of Enron.  Once again, he urged TW sign it as well.  When I 
asked his opinion whether TW should file comments or not, he advised that we 
shouldn't necessarily waste our time.  He feels that parties with bigger 
stakes in the outcome will likely file adequate comments in the case.

Notwithstanding, if it fits your schedule, Susan and I would like for you to 
attend the all-party meeting with Commissioner Duque on Tuesday in order to 
put in an appearance for TW.   From this meeting, you might get a better 
sense for where things stand with this Commissioner, other Commissioners and 
other stakeholders.

I'll be at my desk this afternoon, so give me a call when you get this.  
Thanks.

Hi, Sooz--Just returned from the most hedonistic of all events:  the Jr.
League Christmas boutique.  Everytime I go, I come home thinking we should
forget all family gift-giving and concentrate our efforts on Whoville!
Anyway, it's Marge's birthday and this is what she wanted to do, so we went
with all the hoards and dined on a cold pasta lunch and cold ice tea in the
tearoom for $10.  We were very disappointed when we saw people walking around
upstairs with cheese and chili smothered hotdogs!

Parking a mess--no lots at Palmer due to construction.  So, satellite parking
with shuttle buses.  Took an hour at 2 p.m. from waiting in line to arriving
at the car in Zilker, but the only civil way to handle it.

Your list is wonderful and I've already homed in on my first choices.  Thank
you very much--it will jumpstart my shopping.

More later.  love, mum

December 12th is great for me! I love all those restaurants, expecially PF
Chang's (we might even be able to reserve the captains table this far in
advance). Wait - Lisa: do you like chinese food? i don't think you do.  Any
place sounds great to me and I love the idea of a girls gift exchange! Thanks
for planning this!  Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Love, Ashlea
