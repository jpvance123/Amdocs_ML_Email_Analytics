As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.  

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. 

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

Ken

Mr. Crandall,

It's Chris Murphy here from UofO.  I have a few questions
that I forgot to ask during the interview.
If you have the time to answer them I would very
much appreciate it.  

Are new employees given demo accounts to paper
trade the markets prior to live trading?

If I were to be selected I would like to begin
to watch the energy markets so that I can get a feel for them.  
Do you know of any good information and news sources 
that I could subscribe to in order to get charts, volume, 
open interest and other pertinent data?

Also, do you know of any good books that are devoted
exclusively to trading the energy markets?

I am very excited about this wonderful opportunity 
and I hope to be selected for Super Saturday.

Regards,
Chris

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, July 4, 2001

Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states. 

The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning. 

The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. 

"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on. 

"Generators need to be held accountable," he said. 

The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand. 

Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. 

"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. 

Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. 

"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts." 


BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. 

"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 

The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. 

Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. 

"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences." 

Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. 

"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said. 

The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. 

Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. 

"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said. 

'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' 

California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output. 

"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. 

Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs. 

Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies. 

"No one answered," he said. "They were closed." 

State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.

On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

Dear Sean,

  I have changed 2 deals that were put in as transmission sales : deals # 894692 and 894962 to Buy Resales.  Please make any adjustments necessay to your scheduling sheets, etc.  The new B/R deal numbers are 896676.1 and 896677.1 respectively, to replace the above 2 deals.
  The reason for this change is that the Business Rules of EnPower will not allow the system to recognize a sale of transmission from EPMI to another counterparty.  

  Please contact me with any questions you may have.
  
  Thanks,

  Virginia

Diana- FYI - I won't know when we will be done with all variances until Settlements can tell me with 100% accuracy that we still have these variances outstanding.  
(the reason we don't know for sure is that settlements issues come back again and again and we change some numbers and the CP changes some numbers, etc.)
The answer depends on our cross-check with Max at SCL.  Max will be out until 8-30-01.  Let me know if you need this escalated and we will contact someone else at SCL. 
For my personal information, what kind of time line do you have?

Virginia

Virginia,

I am looking into SCL.  I have all of our checkout forms, our Unify numbers and our outstanding AR/AP.  Unify and AR/AP are fairly clean.  However, there are some gaps in the checkout forms and there are some DMS that have not been closed.  I need to investigate these before giving you an answer that is 100% accurate.

This means I will need to contact Max at SCL to verify all checkout are complete.  He is on vacation from 8/10/01 to 8/30/01.

What is the purpose of this research?  Is there anything the traders are specifically looking for?  What is the timing requirements?

Rhonda-

  I'm not sure who to email about this, but you were the last coordinator for the following 2 counterparties, so maybe you can help me....

  I need to know if we are checked out and paid up from December 2000 thru June 2001 for the following 2 counterparites:

  Seattle City Light (I think we have one DMS left for the month of June 2001)
  City of Tacoma 

  Please forward this to the coordinator if you cannot check.
  Please vouch for the months that you did do the checkouts.

  I need to know with 100% accuracy.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

At Jim Steffes request, I have assembled a matrix of the status of current emerging RTOs/standard markets in North America.

Sarah, could you look at the "next steps" and let me know if I missed anything major?

Also, does any body know if EPSA or some other organization is maintaining a similar overview database.  (FERC's site is out of date).

I will keep the latest version of this on the 0:\public affairs\RTO information database directory.  

Alan

 TMT members and participants: 
       This is to inform you that, at the Implementation Team meeting this morning, the Action Agencies agreed to provide summer spill for fish passage at Bonneville and The Dalles Dams, beginning today, Tuesday 24 July.
       At Bonneville, the Corps and BPA will make best effort to spill 45 kcfs each day for 5 hours.  The spill hours will be 2000 - 0100 hours, as recommended by NMFS.
       At The Dalles, spill will be provided on an hourly basis, when the hourly projection is 71 kcfs or greater, from a minimum 15 kcfs spill up to 30% of total discharge.
       Spill began at 1400 hours today at The Dalles, and is expected to begin at 2000 hours tonight at Bonneville.  The action agencies may change the operation if the spill operation results in unacceptable risks to power system reliability.  The Action Agencies will coordinate changes with TMT.
       Thank you for participating in the TMT and IT discussions over the past few days that led to this operation.

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,

EPMI's request to participate in the 29 Oct 01 FERC conference was granted.  I will be on one of two panels and I will be given 5 minutes to give a statement.

Please review the attached draft statement / talking points for EPMI and PGE and get me comments by COB Monday.  One question is whether we need to change what PGE is proposing to say in light of our position (rule certainty, make any changes to caps consistently accross the WSCC).

I will be meeting with the West Desk folks on Tuesday morning (schedules permitting).  Please let me know if you want to participate in that meeting.

Here is who I think will be on these panels thusfar:
California Rep. Anna Eshoo (D Atherton)
Pacificorp
Allegheny Supply (anybody know who might be speaking for them?)
Powerex/TGF Richard Tabors (note that Enron is a member of TGF but has made it clear it is not funding this effort)
PGE Mike Naeve
EMPI Alan Comnes
CAISO
Puget Energy - Kimberly Harris
and 5  other parties
BPA and WPTF will not be speaking.
I was told Commissioners "may" be present.

Alan Comnes

Sean,

This is just to confirm our conversation over the phone on 12/04/01 at about
9:45 AM Pacific Time.
You stated that Enron will not be able to deliver the 10 MW HLH energy MID C
product to Grays Harbor PUD starting at HE 7 for 12/05/01.

Subject:	Day Ahead "Financial" Parking/Lending product

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Subject:	(Less Than Zero) UBS Deal Shows What Enron Is Worth

UBS Deal Shows What Enron Is Worth
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
By Christopher Edmonds 
Special to TheStreet.com
01/14/2002 02:45 PM EST
As it turns out, analysts had a hard time gauging what price UBS  would have
to pay for embattled Enron's  trading business, because there isn't one. 
Not only is UBS not paying Enron anything up front for the trading business,
Enron will also cede all ownership in the once-dominant trading business.
And to further show the deterioration in Enron's current business, The Wall
Street Journal reports that UBS will not assume any of Enron's current
trading positions. 
According to sources, when Enron releases the details of its sale today, it
will say it is giving its trading business to UBS and hoping for a return in
the future. In fact, UBS will get the trading platform and some employees --
taking a payroll liability from Enron -- and give Enron nothing in return. 
That UBS is providing little, if anything, upfront and is making no
guarantees regarding future profits speaks volumes about how quickly any
residual value in Enron's business has eroded and about what shareholders
can expect from the ultimate outcome. "This has to be very disappointing to
Enron's creditors and sends a strong message to Enron shareholders," says
Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy
Roundtable. 
Though details weren't out as of this writing, sources in a creditors
meeting held this morning in New York confirm that the deal calls for UBS to
provide Enron with a percentage -- said to be one-third -- of the profits
from the energy-trading business to Enron for the next 10 years. 
UBS will have the option to reduce or eliminate Enron's profit-sharing
position by paying a multiple of Enron's share of the profits during the
first five years of the agreement. If UBS elects to continue payments to
Enron over the entire 10-year term, profit-sharing will increase in each of
the last five years of the agreement.
Power Failure
While the Enron spin machine will put its best face on the transaction,
there is little positive in the deal for the bankrupt company. Enron once
hoped the trading unit -- which at one point accounted for more than 90% of
its revenue -- would fetch nearly $1 billion in an auction, with Enron
retaining an equity stake in the revival. 
Instead, the trading business is penniless, leaving Enron looking more and
more like a corporate pauper. 
As suggested Friday, the uncertainty of a resurrection not only caused a
dearth of bidders -- only UBS and Citigroup were serious in their pursuits
-- it also tarnished the potential value of Enron's gem. 
"It's like they are starting over," says Dietert. "We are talking about a
business that will be a small fraction of its former self and will take a
lot of time to rebuild." 
And with online competitors like the Intercontinental Exchange and Dynegy's
:NYSE -Dynegy Direct, it isn't clear how quickly, if at all, UBS can rebuild
the vitality of the Enron platform. 
However, it isn't costing UBS much to try. And with Enron holding no ongoing
ownership interest, UBS may have a chance to leave Enron's tarnished past
behind. "If Enron had any ownership, it would have been very difficult to
rebuild the business," says an official with a competing energy trader and
Enron creditor who wished to remain unnamed. "Sharing the profits is still a
stigma, but not nearly what it could have been. It will still be a tough
comeback." 
And creditors aren't likely to make it any easier. While still reviewing the
details, the power-trading official said creditors have concerns. "We need
to know how they define profit, how UBS plans to rebuild and market the
business and what happens to the profits once paid to Enron," he said.
"Creditors are owed billions, and there has to be some assurance profits
will go toward making creditors whole." 
The deal has to be approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzales of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. He has scheduled a hearing on the deal for
Friday, and creditors are expected to raise a myriad of objections. 
Regardless of approval, analysts remain skeptical about the ability to
re-energize the once-dominant player in the energy-trading business. "There
is only about a 1%, 2%, maybe 3% probability that the old Enron business
re-emerges as a major player among energy traders," says Jay Dobson,
managing director of electric utility research at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.

This auction outcome has to leave Enron's creditors -- and especially
shareholders -- feeling powerless.

Yesterday I talked with Chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 MW we are delivering to them as a "good" contract.  So long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  I'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, I'm going to deliver until I hear otherwise.

This just came to me today.  This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.  It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.  This is all the information that is available.

Enron Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.  While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.  

THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.  REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE
TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.  SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO
TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING
THROUGH NOVEMBER 7, 2001.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.  RECIPIENTS
WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.

RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.

We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.

Thank you.

A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

Sean, 
As you have probably hear, I am not going to be with  UBS, which is both a disappointment and a blessing, perhaps better things await me elsewhere.  While I have tried to convince myself of this, it is difficult to truly accept.  I just wanted to let you know how much I have enjoyed working with you, even if only for a short time.  Hopefully I will be able to stay on with the estate for a while, while things are being settled and I make some decisions regarding the direction of my career.  I should be in the office tomorrow and next week, perhaps we could chat, if you have any advice for me, I will gladly take it.  Best Regards, Serena

Subject:	Modesto 7 MW COB deal @$19.3.

We've been keeping this deal in because I've been concerned about congestions at COB.  I'm not concerned going into February, so this contract is out of the money for February (probably in March thru May however).  If there is some reason to keep it whole, we have the length at COB.  Let me know what we want to do.

	The change would not take long provided if we could easily identify DART deals.  At this point we will have to research identifying DART deals.  We don't know the answer yet.  There is a higher priority project (secondary legal entities) which we hope to complete next week.  We'll schedule this change after that.

Stewart,

Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:

* original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01. 
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.  All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.

I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Dear Heather,

  Please be advised that I have entered a $38,865.43 sale annuity to credit the ST-NW book for BPA April 2001 transmission.
  This EnPower change should get pulled thru this month by Settlements.  I'm not sure if Elsie paid the invoice already and the difference has come thru in Houston's flash.  This may or may not show up as a DPR impact.  I'm thinking that since this is older than 6 weeks, it will be an accounting variance and that the NW book has already recognized the credit....
  Please let me know if you have any questions.  
  Deal # 678029.1.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Diana and Sean:

Just wondering if you happen to know how the scheduling volume in these two deals work?  I believe when we liquidate at the beginning of this month (for example, 8/2) , the volume was zero in stead of 50MW/hr in scheduling.  Would you advise how the "timing" of entering the volume in scheduling was determined?  I am asking because it looks like for the first few days of this month we didn't liquidate anything because at the time the volume in scheduling was zero.  If somebody added the volume later, we will need to know in order to correct total liquidations before the "incomplete liquidations" get to Settlements at month-end.

Please advise, thanks!!!

-Fran

Subject: Fw: Columbia River forecasting report on website


Dear Friend and/or Colleague,
 
A summary of the 2001 season, real-time forecasts of Columbia River runoff made weekly with the HyMet model can be viewed at the following website: 
 
<http://www.hymet.com/colnex1.htm>
 
These results show the accuracy of each forecast made at the three main sites (Grand Coulee, The Dalles and Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River) from January 1 to June 30, 2001, and also demonstrate the influence of abnormal precipitation and temperature during the forecast season on the accuracy. 
 
Precipitation in the Pacific Northwest during the 2001 forecast season was near the record historic low in this region, therefore a significant fraction of the forecast error can be explained by subsequent weather conditions.
 
Your comments are welcome.

Regards/Wendell

Subject:	UPDATE!!! curve manager problems today

Arun in IT confirmed that the prior day curves are showing up correctly in the database, though they are showing up incorrectly on the front end curve manager.  He said it will take some time to fix the front end problems, and he expects the fix to be done by Monday.  He said since prior day prices are correct in the database, it should not mess up our calcs.  So as long as our traders make sure current day's prices are posted as they wanted, we will be fine.

Somehow today in the curve manager, prior day's prices column is not showing the prices as of yesterday, but showing prices based on today's price changes by the trader.  Driscoll first found out about it, and Arun is working on fixing the prior price now.  I'll let you know when he confirmed the problem is fixed.

Kevin,

Is the SP and NP language in the spread language the same language we use when we transact SP15 or NP15 on eol?

Hello, Everyone - 
 
RTO West will hold two days of meetings Monday, February 11, and Tuesday, February 12, 2002 to review, discuss and seek consensus on the draft filing that RTO West is preparing to submit to FERC by March 1.  These sessions are part of a broader consensus seeking activity with stakeholders, the Congressional delegation, and all parties interested in RTO West.  The meetings will afford an opportunity to Regional Representatives to prioritize and explain their key issues to the RTO West principals.
 
The meetings will be Monday, February 11, from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and Tuesday, February 12, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. at the Shilo Inn located at 11707 NE Airport Way.  The Shilo Inn is about 2-3 miles east of the Portland Airport and east of I-205.  From I-205 take exit 24 from the north or exit 24B from the south.  If you need overnight accommodations, the Shilo Inn phone number is 503-252-7500.
 
The draft filing will be posted by February 6.  We will notify you when it is on the RTO West website.  We will also be sending you an agenda for the sessions with structured time slots for input on specific elements of the draft filing.  During the afternoon session on February 12, preliminary Benefit Cost Study results will be presented for discussion.
 
The working agenda is as follows:
 
On February 11
- draft preliminary Filing Letter,
- current draft of Transmission Operation Agreement (TOA), and 
- revised draft of Congestion Management proposal.
 
On February 12
- revised draft of Pricing proposal,
- draft Ancillary Services proposal,
- revised draft of Planning and Expansion proposal,
- revised draft of Market Monitoring proposal,
- proposed draft of Insurance, Indemnity and Limitation of Liability Agreement,
- revised drafts of Scheduling Coordination and Paying Agent Agreement, and
- preliminary results of the Benefit Cost Study.
 
Again, you can expect a more detailed agenda for the meetings and a notice that the draft filing is posted by February 6.
 
Thank you,
Christine Elliott,
RTO West Coordinating Team

Energy Secretary Names Bonneville Head

WASHINGTON, DC -- Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced
today the appointment of Steve Wright as administrator of the Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA).  BPA is a federal agency that markets wholesale
electrical power, principally from federal dams in the Columbia Basin, and
operates high voltage transmission for the region.  It is based in Portland,
Oregon, and serves Washington, Idaho, Oregon, western Montana and small
parts of contiguous states.

"Bonneville is extremely important to maintaining a vital economy and
healthy environment in the Pacific Northwest, and I have confidence it will
continue to do so under Steve Wright's direction," said Secretary Abraham.
"Steve exerted outstanding leadership through some of the most turbulent
times for the electricity industry and has effectively worked with diverse
constituencies in the region," added Abraham.

Wright has been with the agency for 21 years, beginning in the agency's
conservation department.  He has served as acting administrator since
November 2000 following the departure of then-Administrator Judi Johansen.
Wright's tenure has spanned some of the region's biggest energy
challenges--including a West Coast energy crisis and the second worst
drought recorded in Pacific Northwest history.  

Wright said he was particularly honored to have come through the ranks to
have the opportunity to lead an institution that is critical to meeting the
economic and environmental objectives of Northwest citizens.  "I'm committed
to operating BPA as a sound business enterprise, but one whose mission
starts with meeting our responsibilities to serve the public.  That means
striving for strong environmental stewardship, low rates, reliable service
and being open to the public's ideas about how best to use the assets that
provide so much value to the Northwest," Wright said.

Wright began his work at BPA in 1981 shortly after receiving his masters in
public affairs from the University of Oregon.  Following a stint in the
agency's energy conservation office, he moved to BPA's D.C. office in 1984.
In 1987, he began managing the agency's California office, then went back to
the D.C. office as manager in 1990.  In 1998, he returned to BPA
headquarters in Portland as Corporate senior vice president where he had
responsibility for public affairs; environment, fish and wildlife; finance
and budget; strategic planning; and human resources.  He became deputy
administrator in 2000, followed shortly by his appointment as acting
administrator.  

He and his wife, Kathleen, and their three children live in Portland.  In
addition to his  masters, he holds an undergraduate bachelor of arts degree
in journalism from Central Michigan University.  He is 44 years old.

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL called regarding the setup of Mid-C "Dart Product" ( I might be mis-spelling).  He advised you have been asking IT to get this created.  Would you let me know the nature of this new "product"?  Risk might need to set you up in some systems in order for everything to be working right.

Thanks,

CAISO is essentially suspending 10-minute dispatch for energy supplied on the ties!  If you get dispatched at the beginning of the hour, you will stay on for the entire hour.

Alan Comnes


Beginning at 2359 on December 12, 2001, the ISO will alter the way it  pays inter-tie bids for Energy.  Specifically, the ISO (1) will continue to pre-dispatch an inter-tie bid in merit order in the BEEP stack before the beginning of the operating hour but (2) now ensure such a bid is dispatched throughout the entire operating hour (i.e., never reversed), thus paying the bid the Instructed Energy Price for all ten-minute intervals in that hour.  As before, the ISO must continue to comply with the Commission's June 19 Order and so the  inter-ties can not set the Market Clearing Price.

Foundation Gives Way on Chief's Big Dream

November 29, 2001 

By JOHN SCHWARTZ and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.


 

Well before anyone could imagine that Enron might collapse,
Kenneth L. Lay was stumped. In an interview in August, he
dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy
company's annual report that hinted at bigger problems if
its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels.


"I just can't help you on that," he said. Pressed further
on questions about a bewildering constellation of business
partnerships that involved Enron's former chief financial
officer, he said, "You're getting way over my head." 

At the least, Mr. Lay - a man of big ideas, a crusader for
free markets, a risk taker in the Texas wildcatter
tradition - had taken his eye off the ball. While he was
busy befriending the nation's most powerful politicians,
erecting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and
pasting Enron's logo on the city's new ballpark, the little
things were turning out to be Mr. Lay's big problems. 

One after another, disclosures spilled out of his company
over the last month: the partnerships had hidden billions
in debt; years of Enron's reported profits had been
exaggerated; the government was investigating. Rivals were
shunning Enron's energy trading desks, which Mr. Lay had
built into the world's leaders. And sure enough, the stock
price tumbled day after day, and credit agencies lowered
Enron's ratings once and then yesterday again, turning the
company's debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock. 

Three weeks ago, Mr. Lay tried to salvage his creation by
selling it to Dynegy, his Houston rival. Yesterday, Dynegy
pulled out of the deal. Deprived of enough information, and
then repelled by what they learned, the free markets in
which Mr. Lay had put so much faith all but destroyed, in a
matter of weeks, everything he had built. 

"If they had been going a slower speed, the results would
not have been disastrous," said Bob McNair, a Houston
energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to
Enron three years ago. But Enron, he said in an interview
this month, was like a race car, and the markets like an
unforgiving track. "It's a lot harder to keep it on the
track at 200 miles per hour," he said. "You hit a bump and
you're off the track." 

>From his youth, Mr. Lay, 59, had nurtured an abiding faith
in the markets' wisdom. He studied economics at the
University of Missouri, living at home to save on room and
board, and eventually earned a Ph.D. in the subject. As a
naval officer serving in the Pentagon, he worked to develop
more efficient accounting systems. Later, he served as an
aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas
industry - a market that Enron would come to dominate. 

Moving into the private sector, he worked his way up the
ranks of the natural gas industry, becoming chief executive
in 1984 of the Houston Natural Gas Corporation, a big
regional pipeline operator. He engineered its merger with
Internorth, an Omaha pipeline company, and then became
chief executive of the combined company and changed its
name to Enron. 

Mr. Lay saw Enron's mission as far more than being a
conduit for fuel. At the time, gas prices were regulated
and pipelines played a relatively passive role; buyers and
sellers could not cut deals on the fly. But as oil prices
plunged in the mid-80's and gas users began switching to
cheaper fuel oil, Mr. Lay returned to Washington to argue,
successfully, for rules changes that he said would save the
pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the
best deals from both gas producers and utilities. 

The new flexibility brought the threat of chaos, however,
as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly. That is
when the new Enron was truly born. To help customers shield
themselves from risk, Mr. Lay's Enron developed hedging
contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn
and copper and winter wheat. Its innovative "gas bank" let
utilities lock up the long-term prices that they craved;
Enron lined up the gas supplies from producers, arranged
for delivery - and took a cut of every deal. 

That business became the forerunner of Enron's entry into
hundreds of other markets, helping customers obtain
supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric
power to pulp and paper and, most recently, fast broadband
access to the Internet. Trading soon provided more of the
company's profits than the traditional natural gas
business. 

While other companies, including Dynegy, focused on
accumulating hard assets like pipelines, turbines and gas
fields, Enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading
company with an almost limitless future. 

"There is a very reasonable chance that we will become the
biggest corporation in the world," Mr. Lay's handpicked
successor as Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling,
told the authors of a book, just published, about business
on the Internet. Even the book's title, "Radical E: From GE
to Enron - Lessons on How to Rule the Web"
(PricewaterhouseCoopers), showed the cachet the company had
attained. Enron, the authors wrote, was "creating a culture
in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and
rewarded." 

Mr. Skilling abruptly resigned in August, after just six
months on the job, propelling Mr. Lay back into the gritty
details of Enron's businesses that he had sought to leave
to others. 

As the company grew, he had become increasingly involved in
public affairs, serving as host when a global economic
conference was held in Houston in 1990 and when the
Republican National Convention came to the city in 1992. 

Like the leaders of many big Texas businesses - the
construction colossus Brown & Root after World War II or
Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems in the 1960's - Mr.
Lay knew the value of courting politicians and policy
makers. 

He played golf with President Bill Clinton; became good
friends with the Texas governor, Ann Richards; and
supported Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, whose wife, Wendy, a
former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, joined Enron's board. 

"He's a stand-up guy," said Ms. Richards, now a business
consultant in New York. Asked to be more specific, she
said, "He's at the meeting" - meaning she could count on
Mr. Lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked
him to do, and not just sign onto a project for show. 

Mr. Lay's deepest political ties were with the Bush family.
In the 1980's, he became a major fund-raiser for George H.
W. Bush. When Mr. Bush lost his 1992 campaign for re-
election as president, Mr. Lay brought a number of senior
Bush aides to Enron as directors or consultants, including
James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, and
Robert A. Mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce. 

Mr. Lay also cultivated Mr. Bush's son George W. long
before he was considered a serious national candidate.
After the younger Mr. Bush's election as Texas governor in
1994, Mr. Lay became head of the Governor's Business
Council, an important advisory post. 

The bond with President Bush is personal. As governor, Mr.
Bush sent Mr. Lay a kidding note in 1997. "One of the sad
things about old friends is that they seem to be getting
older - just like you!" he wrote. "55 years old. Wow! That
is really old. Thank goodness you have such a young,
beautiful wife," he added, a reference to Mr. Lay's wife,
Linda. 

In 1999, Mr. Lay sent a handwritten Christmas note to Mr.
Bush and his wife, Laura. "Linda and I are so proud of both
of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the White
House," he wrote. 

Yesterday, the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer,
said the Treasury Department was monitoring Enron's
downfall for its effect on the market. Asked if the
president himself had any reaction, Mr. Fleisher said, "The
president's reaction is that it should be monitored." 

In some ways, Enron's collapse was one more example of the
bursting of the Internet bubble. But Mr. Lay was not some
stylish dot-com brat; by all accounts, he is an immensely
likable product of Middle America. Growing up in tiny Rush
Hill, Mo., he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting
away savings. By 16, his sister Sharon recalled this week,
"he was bucking bales" - that is, loading hay - "and had
two jobs in the summer, painting houses." 

"I don't think you could ever say that he did something the
easy way," she said. 

That work ethic ran in the family. Mr. Lay's father was a
minister who also sold farm equipment. The family's
finances were spotty, "at times no money, at times some
money," Ms. Lay recalled. Still, the Lays took in people
from their church who were in need. 

Over the last decade or so, Mr. Lay earned some $300
million from Enron, mostly by exercising stock options.
Earlier this month, when employees grew incensed at the
prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the
company's sale to Dynegy, he volunteered to walk away from
$60 million in payments. 

Mr. McNair, the Houston entrepreneur, who has known Mr. Lay
for years, suggested that perhaps everything had not been
disclosed to him. "Maybe the people who reported to him
told him what they wanted him to hear, but they weren't
telling him everything," he said. 

Mr. McNair said he spoke to Mr. Lay recently and found him
"somewhat in a state of shock." Mr. McNair added, "He's
devastated." 

In the end, it seems, the man whose company did so much to
help others manage their risk could not manage his own.

Remember we had those volumes in View Actuals for #517676.1?  
You have sucessfully fixed it (zeroed out the volumes) but I just found we have the same problem for deal# 517678.1 for 10/1-10/3.  Would you please zeroed out the volumes in this deal as well?  If possible, we need this to be done by 11/2 morning before we run reports and send it out to Settlements.  Thanks!

Diana, good question.  I have asked Chuck Dial (6-345-3486) in IT Enpower group earlier this month when I spotted that the records are different and he advised this looks like a one time mess up.  We couldn't find the reason but yes ideally they should synchronize.  Remember earlier this month we had some FSP issues, and Chuck was wondering if that's associated but we could not be sure.  He ran some testing in the back end afterwards and every test showed synchronized results.  Therefore for this NCPA buy/resale deal we'll have to manually zero out the volume in View Actuals to make it right.

I went into Scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out.  I'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry.  I believe these should synchronize, or they read off of one another. ??

Hi Diana and Sean:

I believe we didn't buy/resell with NCPA for 10/1/01-10/3/01.  Although we are good in scheduling (no activities scheduled) there are some volumes showing up in deal entry side ("view actuals" tab).  In order to make sure that at month end settlement processes will be smooth for these NCPA buy/resale deals, I would like to ask the scheduling group to zero out those volumes for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in view actuals in deal entry, but I need you to give me the green light first.  Your confirmation will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Fran

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=
rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i=
t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=
rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=

Dear Amy,

  My apologies that it has taken me a day or two to respond about the December 2001 checkout.
  I have spoken with our traders and learned that the reason EPMI deals # 585276.1 and 585277.1 are not in the system beyond December 2, 2001 is because (due to bankruptcy proceedings), Modesto Irrigation District requested termination of our contract on December 2, 2001.  I understand that there was physical delivery every day of the month and I am working with our teams to get this in our system correctly.

  Please call me if you have any questions.  I will send you an email when this has been finished.

  Thanks,

   Virginia

Diana-

   I have not heard an answer from Gwen yet on those PMA's, but I am working with risk and I have let Fran know that I am looking into this so as not to hit your DPR twice.  I'll let you know once I have heard from everyone.

  Thanks for your patience,

Hi Chris:
 
What happened to the LIA, GIA, ancillary services, interregional coordination, filing letter, and other filing materials that were to have been part of Friday's review?  I assume they will be part of our discussions/negotiations on Feb. 11-12?  And is the date for the final "package" for RRG et al. review, Feb. 4?
 
Please let us know, and thanks.

Hello, Everyone - 
 
This notice confirms the RTO West clarification/review session this Friday, January 25, 2002, at the Kingstad Conference Center first floor meeting room.

At the January 25th meeting, we will also provide an update to the schedule for completing filing documents. (So far, RTO RRG days are still scheduled for 2/11 and 2/12/02.)   
 
Preliminary drafts of the Scheduling Coordinator Agreement and Appendix and the Paying Agent Agreements were posted on the RTO West website at <http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm> .  Drafts of the Bylaws and the Pricing Proposal revisions will be posted by tomorrow.  We will send a notice to you when they are available on the website.

- Update on Schedule to Complete Filing Documents,
- Draft Scheduling Coordinator Agreement and Appendix,
- Draft Paying Agent Agreement,
- Draft Revisions to Pricing Proposal,

Sean, thank you for your rent deposit yesterday.  I really appreciate your timeliness.  I will be in Portland Sat Jan 26 to Wed Jan 30 for business reasons.  
 
I need to have an electrician install smoke detectors per the new code effective the first of January + I want to get the phone jack fixed in the guest bedroom.  I also need to meet with the landscaper about pruning the back hedge.  I'll be up to my ears in business meetings all day Monday and Tuesday morning.  I was thinking about making appointments for the electrician and the landscaper for Tuesday afternoon.  I will be there to let them know what I need to have done so I can give them access.  Is that ok with you?    Is there anything else that needs attention?
 
Hope life isn't too crazy for you with all the press Enron is getting these days.  Deborah

Houston has requested we sit down with them on the phone and go over all the in-the-money contracts we have.  By their count we have about 50.  They want to account for each and understand why we may not be delivering on them.

Ed Baughman will be sending his master list in advance of a 11:30 call in Mt. Bachelor.  Please send at least one representative from each of the regional desks to discuss the list.

Thanks,

Steve

....just crazy, I've been dying to call you all day to make sure you were
okay but I figured your probably being bombarded with calls right now, so I
was just waiting for some time.  There are a lot of rumors out there? Are
you okay? The latest piece of news is your possible chapter 7 filing, and
I've been raking my mind trying to see if you guys will be taken care of in
that case. I know you all have personal contracts.  Its amazing how a great
company like Enron can come tumbling down to its knees.  I can't even
imagine the atmosphere over there, I was watching the screen as you guys
pulled all of your numbers, I really couldn't speak for a second.  This
industry is never boring that's for sure.  I've been getting calls from
everyone, it looks like the key word for the day is exposure....

Today I reviewed NCPA related deals for 11/1-11/6 and found:

11/1 => good
11/2 => somehow the lightload sale side (deal 517676.1) is only showing HE1-HE6 in the scheduling system now.  I wonder if someone deleted HE23-HE24 afterwards (*on the lightload purchase side we have both HE1-HE6 and HE23-HE24, deal 517673.1).  
11/3 => good
11/4 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/5 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/6 => annuity missing (no power delievered)

Please let me know if you could restore the HE23-HE24 for 11/2 back in the scheduling system if they should be there, also please let me know when the missed annuities are entered.  I have also attached my worksheet for your convenient reference.

 
Thanks,

Hello, Everyone -
 
RTO West will hold two days of meetings Monday, February 11, and Tuesday, February 12, 2002 to review, discuss and seek consensus on the draft filing that RTO West is preparing to submit to FERC.  The meetings will give Regional Representatives an opportunity to prioritize and explain their key issues to the RTO West principals before the filing planned for March 1, 2002.
 
The meetings will be Monday, February 11, from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and Tuesday, February 12, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. at the Shilo Inn located at 11707 NE Airport Way.  The Shilo Inn is about 2-3 miles east of the Portland Airport and east of I-205.  From I-205 take exit 24 from the north or exit 24B from the south.  If you need overnight accommodations, the Shilo Inn phone number is 503-252-7500.
 
The meetings will focus on discussing the substantive issues that RRG members raise during the meeting.  To the extent possible, Regional Representatives are encouraged to confer with other stakeholders in developing their input.  Because there is also an opportunity to submit written comments on the drafts until close of business February 15, we encourage participants to bring up substantive input at the meeting and rely on written submittals for providing detailed comments.
 
We recognize that there is alot of material to cover during the two days of meetings.  A proposed agenda and proposed time allocation is attached so you can estimate when topics you are interested in will come up.  However, we will be as flexible as possible.
 
A number of the filing drafts are now posted at <http://www.rtowest.org/DraftFilingDocforMar12002.htm> .  By the end of the day, all of the draft materials for the filing should be posted.
 
Thank you,
Christine Elliott,

Kroum has developed a new Forward Obligation Report, which will allow us to capture all term deals, desk-to-desk and all scheduling changes.  Both Heather Dunton and I have tested it in stage and will be pushed out to production soon.  Once I have the date I will forward it to all of you.  It should be within the next couple of days.  I will also show all of you how to run the report to capture the criteria we need to do our swaps.

All:
 
I recommend this presentation to traders and other folks who are involved with transmission and/or market structures.  It is more likley (although far off) that the RTO West may move to a locational (nodal) marginal pricing (LMP) model, akin to the way PJM operates.  Andy Ott is a key manager at PJM and this is a unique opportunity to hear how that system operates from someone who has direct experience.
 
Please let me know if you will go.  I will be going and cam offer to drive.

The briefing will be in room F on the first floor of the Kingstad meeting center, 5933 Win Sivers Drive (off Airport Way).

Subject: Dinner Reply

Sean:

Thanks for the dinner the other night.  I enjoyed meeting with you and Deanna and getting caught up on how things are going.  It was also good to hear that both of you are optimistic about the outlook with UBS.  I wanted to respond to your offer to meet with Mr. Belden to discuss potential opportunities within your origination group.  Having considered the opportunities relative to the outlook for my consulting business, I am not interested in pursuing the UBS opportunity at this time.  The concept of running the origination from Seattle intrigued me initially, but I cannot personally advocate a geographically segregated origination operation as a viable business solution.  

I would be interested in a follow up meeting with you and Tim, but I think my intent would be framed from exploring potential opportunities to provide consulting services to UBS rather than exploring employment opportunities.  I understand that this may not fit with your needs to prioritize your own time and efforts right now, but if you would like to get together, please let me know.

Also - I don't have Deanna's e-mail address.  If you could forward this on to her, I would appreciate it.  Thanks again for the dinner last week.

Sean, 

Enclosed is a proposed methodology for the Dow Jones Hourly Index.  Our
longer term goal is to have this information posted to a website and
available on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay.  That will
take longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation with
receiving the information too early.  Presently, our goal is to have this
information available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. PT.  This is
preliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.

Cheers,

Diana and Sean:

Attached please find the latest prior month adjuments to be entered in your P&L for 10/31/01.  The total amount will be -$206,492.82, primarily due to demand charge liquidation adjustment (-$204,999.92) for deal 555367.1.  I have researched on this item and believe it is valid.  

Please also note the attached file is preliminary.  There could be more to come from Settlements between now and month-end.  I'll update you if that happens.  Please take a look at the items listed now and let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Fran

Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list. Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of. 
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

This year, the onsite interviews are scheduled for two Saturdays in November.  On each Saturday, the top 9 - 12 candidates from our local schools will be present.  This will help tremendously with our cross-calibration process.  The dates and schools are as follows:

	Saturday, November 10, candidates will be drawn from:  
		University of Portland
		University of Oregon
		University of Washington
		Washington State University

	Saturday, November 17, candidates will be drawn from:
		Portland State University
		UC Davis (Associate candidates only)
		Oregon State University

We will need you to participate in at least one of these Saturday events.  We will also need 5-6 people to overlap and attend both Saturdays, so please volunteer if you are able.  (PS:  If we don't have enough overlap, we will have to begin "drafting", so please help out where you can.)

TASK ITEM:  Please respond to this message, indicating which Saturday(s) you will be able to attend.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thank you in advance for your help.  It is very much appreciated!

Normally I'd say this is unbelievable...but considering who sent it, I can't say I'm surprised...

Ray,

Should we take this up with Bob Pease, or since it was inadequate to begin with, just forget it?

Dave

Sean,
Enclosed is a proposed methodology for the Dow Jones Hourly Index.  Our
longer term goal is to have this information posted to a website and
available on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay.  That will
take longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation with
receiving the information too early.  Presently, our goal is to have this
information available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. PT.  This is
preliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.

Cheers,



Ernest Onukogu

SCHOLTES, DIANA K:
 
Attached below you will find the final Evaluation forms for your direct reports; these forms have been pre-populated with your employees' basic data. If you have already completed your employees' final Evaluations, you may disregard these forms. 
 
When completing the Evaluation, carefully consider employee input, consolidated feedback and your observations of their performance and contribution, and encourage employee participation in the evaluation discussion. For many employees, this will be the only formal opportunity to discuss their performance with their supervisor. 
 
Final Evaluations should be completed and returned to your HR representative by August 17 (July 31 for all those in Business Units reporting to Enron Europe) for employees in job groups below Vice President level. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact your HR representative or the PEP help desk at x34777, option 4.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Third Day in the Thirties

As traders filled out their ballots for the Friday/Saturday package, peak
power prices throughout the West shed a couple of dollars from Wednesday's
levels, but were said to remain in "pretty strong" territory.  While traders
primarily blamed the softer prices on the usual expectations of lower
weekend demand, others lamented that the stronger trend of late didn't coast
into a third day of trading.  "It looks like the winter could be pretty
bullish if there are additional unexpected unit outages on the horizon,"
speculated one marketer.  Nonetheless, no traders expected a return to
100$/MWh territory anytime soon, with most reportedly sufficiently hedged to
meet load projections through the New Year.  Helping sustain the recent
strength was another strong day in the natural gas market, with NYMEX Henry
Hub front-month pieces gaining 3.7 cents on Thursday to close at
2.756$/mmBtu, while similar goods for February were seen 2.9 cents higher
than a day ago, closing at 2.822$/mmBtu.  In other news, a national
electricity deregulation bill set to go to Congress remained in committee
this week, due primarily to concerns over state rights.  Such a bill would
reportedly grant authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission above
current interstate powers, which has met opposition from both the 106th and
107th Congresses.

Heavy load energy costs in the Pacific Northwest fell by more than 2.5$/MWh
on lower weekend demand and weather forecasts calling for some milder
temperatures over the next several days.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia
traded between 30.25 to 33$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions taking place
around the 31.5$/MWh mark.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW), down with a
tube leak since Tuesday, had its ETR extended until Friday.  Flow forecasts
for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 90 kcfs Friday, 55 kcfs
Saturday, 50 kcfs Sunday, and 95 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.  Weather
forecasts called for temperatures to dip slightly over the weekend, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly above-normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Despite spot natural gas prices remaining at Wednesday's robust levels and
slightly below-normal temperature forecasts for the weekend, peak power
prices in the Golden State declined a bit on Thursday.  Market players said
the day was busy, but couldn't pinpoint exactly why, with generation healthy
and other fundamentals accounted for.  Some hypothesized that with greater
scrutiny on the electricity market, some corporations were asking traders to
organize their books more thoroughly then usual at the end of this year.
Peak goods at NP15 changed hands between 32.5 and 37.25$/MWh, falling about
2 and 3$/MWH, respectively, off the high and low ends.  The off-peak product
saw action from 27.5 to 31$/MWh, within 50 cents of Wednesday deals at both
ends.  Natural gas prices at the Southern California border shaved just a
cent, trading between 2.59 and 2.64$/mmBtu.  SCE's CEO Stephen Frank
reportedly will retire effective January 1, 2002.  He postponed retirement
to steer the trouble utility through its bankruptcy reorganization.  In unit
news, California curtailments were fairly minor on Thursday.  Gas-fired unit
Crockett Cogen (260 MW), down since just Wednesday, returned to service on
Thursday.  Forecasts for Friday called for highs only in the 46 to 59 degree
range at most major load centers across the state, with overnight lows in
the 35 to 46 degree range.  Temperatures were expected to stay slightly
below normal through Monday, while the latest six-to-ten predicted normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Amid cool temperatures and a sustained maintenance outage, peak power prices
nonetheless slumped in line with other prices in the West for the
Friday/Saturday combo in brisk Thursday trade.  Heavy load pieces at Palo
Verde changed hands between 32 and 36$/MWh, losing about 2$/MWh off both
ends of the price range.  In unit news, Four Corners #4 (750 MW) remained
off-line for condenser repairs, with an expected return of December 15.
Temperatures were expected to stay substantially below normal through
Sunday, with highs in the mid-50s and lows in the 30s.  Warming was
predicted for Monday, with the mercury expected to climb back into the
mid-60s.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from
December 19 to 23.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

___________________________________________________________
Forecasts for colder weather in the new week were revised on Thursday to a
more normal outlook, causing day-ahead power prices to fall across the
Eastern Interconnect.  Traders said the next week product was still changing
hands at a premium on Thursday, but most thought it would take a tumble on
Friday as the market absorbs the new forecast.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures headed higher on colder forecasts Thursday, but the upturn was
limited by the high storage levels.  January gained 3.7 cents to end at
2.756$/mmBtu, while February rose 2.9 cents to close at 2.822$/mmBtu.

As the prospects for winter weather and the corresponding strong demand it
brings remained dim on Thursday, heavy load electricity prices skidded lower
in the Mid-Atlantic.  Western PJM goods were bought and sold between 21.8
and 22.7$/MWh, down 30 cents to a day ago at both ends.  After a brief climb
to the lofty heights of 30$/MWh, LMPs settled back into the high-teens and
averaged 16.94$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported no new major
outages, and said trading was generally quiet on Thursday.  Forecasts for
Friday called for even warmer temperatures, with highs reaching the mid-60s
and lows in the also comfortable mid-50s.  Cooling was expected over the
weekend, and forecasts for the first day of the new week called for highs in
the 48 to 57 degree range.  The latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal
temperatures from December 19 to 23.

On mild temperatures and not much else, peak power prices softened in the
Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy deals were done from 15.5 to 19$/MWh,
with most transactions completed in the 17s.  Trades for the front week
contract were heard around 22.55$/MWh.  In other Cinergy news, the
corporation sold $275 million in convertible 3 year bonds with a 9.5% yield
on Thursday, up $25 million from the original estimate of $250 million worth
of bonds.  On the unit front, nuke Dresden #3 (800 MW) remained down for
water leak repairs.  High temperatures for Friday were expected in the
mid-40s, with lows about 5 degrees lower in the 34 to 40 degree range.  The
five day outlook showed little change and the latest six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from December 19 to 23.

Heavy load electricity prices weakened on Thursday in the Southeast,
depressed by continued warm temperatures and a healthy generation landscape.
Into Entergy goods changed hands between 18.5 and 20$/MWh, with the bulk of
deals done within a dime of 19$/MWh.  Into TVA trades were heard from 16.75
to 18.5$/MWh. In Washington, the fate of TVA's unfinished power plants was a
topic of the day, as members of Congress discussed whether TVA should be
allowed to lease the unfinished stations from its October $3.4 billion asset
reduction to private corporations for financing to complete them.  High
temperatures were expected uniformly in the 60s across the Southeast through
Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
December 19 to 23.

Diana and Sean:

The +$640,000 prior month adjustment associated with annuity deal # 487408.1 was already made on 3/31/2001 in your book.  On that date we gave you back a total of +$1,202,820.8 in adjustments, including the +$640,000 you are looking for.  For your reference, attached please find the detail sheet (by deal) which shows all adjusments you got on 3/31/01.  If you have any questions or concerns on this, please feel free to let me know.


 

Thanks,
Fran

Subject:	487408 Annuity

Fran - Diana and Sean are looking for a PMA adjustment of 640,000 for the deal below (note from Sean).
Could you look into this .....

Thanks,
Heather





I had a deal with Modesto in December that consisted of a buy-resale with Modesto.  It was a take-or-pay deal.  We did not schedule this deal for 10-days in December (zeroed out in scheduling).  We should have put in an annuity each day we didn't schedule it, but we failed to do so.  At the end of the month, I realized we had not been doing this, so I put in an annuity to Modesto for $1.04 Million (Deal 487408).  This impact was seen in my December P&L.  Towards the middle of January, it was brought to my attention that we were not checking out with Modesto on this deal.  I looked into it, and it turns out I miscalculated how many days we did not schedule the deal, so the annuity should have been for $400,000, not $1,040,000.  On January 23, we modified the annuity to the correct amount.

The question I have now is, where is the $640,000, and do I get this back in the form of a prior month adjustment?

Thanks
Sean

Diana, good question.  I have asked Chuck Dial (6-345-3486) in IT Enpower group earlier this month when I spotted that the records are different and he advised this looks like a one time mess up.  We couldn't find the reason but yes ideally they should synchronize.  Remember earlier this month we had some FSP issues, and Chuck was wondering if that's associated but we could not be sure.  He ran some testing in the back end afterwards and every test showed synchronized results.  Therefore for this NCPA buy/resale deal we'll have to manually zero out the volume in View Actuals to make it right.

I went into Scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out.  I'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry.  I believe these should synchronize, or they read off of one another. ??

Deal # 517673.1 and 517674.1

HI Diana and Sean:

Would you advise whether I can ask scheduling to zero out volumes for NCPA buy/resale deals for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in "View Actual" tab in deal entry?  

Thanks,

Hi Diana and Sean:

I believe we didn't buy/resell with NCPA for 10/1/01-10/3/01.  Although we are good in scheduling (no activities scheduled) there are some volumes showing up in deal entry side ("view actuals" tab).  In order to make sure that at month end settlement processes will be smooth for these NCPA buy/resale deals, I would like to ask the scheduling group to zero out those volumes for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in view actuals in deal entry, but I need you to give me the green light first.  Your confirmation will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Fran

e Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welc=
ome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for resp=
onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams nee=
d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i=
nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lea=
d" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsibl=
e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t=
he proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex=
t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  Th=
e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho=
uld be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and pr=
oducing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments wil=
l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial =
people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues=
. =20

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some area=
s, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  =
Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to=
 draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please=
 remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR proce=
ss must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the =
necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea=
d named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will =
be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in =
Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron =
make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FE=
RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also b=
e responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments a=
re due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceed=
ing, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's =
marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is=
 a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio=
n to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has=
 indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme=
nts, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the=
 market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we p=
lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit exp=
ert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be th=
e Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif=
ornia ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t=
o cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proc=
eeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, =
a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr=
ent price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps i=
n an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaki=
ng season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will b=
e starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc=
ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be =
needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these procee=
dings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is =
the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons=
traints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  =
-- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission p=
lans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a hig=
h priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated tha=
t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id=
entify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progre=
ss in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project =
Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici=
pants to provide more information than is currently required, including at =
least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a signi=
ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c=
ommercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commis=
sion has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the Califor=
nia ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a h=
earing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact. =20
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The J=
udge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that re=
funds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in =
response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.=
 =20
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various f=
ilings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTO=
s in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocati=
ng, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO =
in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly=
.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to=
 create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pend=
ing before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before Oct=
ober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation =
to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pe=
nding before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before O=
ctober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

I'm still working on the reading materials.

Subject:=09Teams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings


As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and =
papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad=
dress over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to En=
ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these iss=
ues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it=
 is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond. =20

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to=
 respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will als=
o work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a part=
icular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call th=

Diana and Sean:

Up to 11/26/01, 
1. we are missing the annuities for 11/7, 11/18, 11/19, 11/22, 11/23, and 11/24
2. we need to restore HE23-24 for deal# 517676.1 for 11/2/01 (lightload sale in NP15) in scheduling

Please let me know if you need any help entering the annuities or restoring the HE23-HE24 scheduling (for 11/2/01 for deal 517676.1).

As the month-end is approaching, I am hoping we can clear the above issues up before Settlements captures the wrong P&L.

Thanks,

Fran

Dear Group,

I have deposited information in each of your mail slots concerning the WSPP meeting October 11 and 12 (Thu and Fri) in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.  After you have completed filling out the registration materials for this meeting, please give the forms to me, and I will handle your enrollment.

I have also included several pages of outing ideas for some of your "special" customers that may attend this meeting.  Let me know if I can help in arranging that as well. I know it may seem premature to reserve anything right now, but the area is expecting a number of visitors, so I advise you to plan as far in advance as possible.  We may be hosting an event the evening of October 11, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

As always, I am also available to assist in making your travel arrangements.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Anna

This morning I received a termination notice from BPA. Effective 2/1/02 BPA is terminating contract numbers 97PB-10123 and 98PB-10227. Both have one way payment provisions. Harlan Murphy is checking the effectiveness of their
notice. We need to make adjustments to west power schedules as soon as Harlan confirms termination validity.

Good Morning,

NOB is derated to Zero for HE 5-12 for Saturday July 28th.  Our Downstreams at NOB are cut to zero for those hours, and the deal numbers have been changed and noted in scheduling.

The deals are:

Nevada Power 423713.1 

BPA  459815.1

LADWP 579025.1 and 548842.1


Special Conditions on LDWP deal 541395.1 require that we re-supply them at a different and mutually agreed upon delivery point. Sean and Art from LDWP agreed that this alternate delivery would be COB, and this deal has been adjusted to show HE 7-12 is at COB N/S now.


Please see me if you have any questions regarding these deals.

Cara

 When either of you has a minute, can we discuss some deals with BPA (P & S)

  There seem to be quite a few deals missing in the system for January thru July.

                        ***** NEW LOCATION*****

Hello, Everyone -

This confirms the next meeting of the RTO West Regional Representatives
Group (RRG) for Friday, November 9, at the Kingstad Meeting Center, Room F.
The meeting will start at 8:30 a.m. and by 12:30 p.m. The Kingstad Meeting
Center is in the same building as the RTO West administrative office.  We
will meet in the same room we used for the PJM-LMP Congestion Management
briefing with Seabron Adamson and Andrew Ott on October 23.  Coffee,
pastries, and jiuce will be served.

The address of the Kingstad Center is 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive, and as most
of you know, it is located about three miles directly east of the Portland
airport.  Go about three miles east on Airport Way and take a right on Win
Sivers Drive and right again at the second driveway.  Parking will be
available in Kingstad marked spaces as well as overflow parking in the
Leatherman's lot across the street.  If you have any questions about the
logistics for the meeting, please call Judy Welch at (503) 262-9421.

Early next week I'll send out an agenda for the meeting.

Have a great weekend.

- Bud

I am also attaching some backup slides, a listing of who will be on the two panels, the statement by Naeve on behalf of PGE, and statement Tabors on behalf of a TFG subset.  I want to re-read Tabors one more time but I expect that will we sign on in support.

In this case PPM, the purchase, was cut. The sale side, PNGC did not get any power and are sending us LD's. Both sides are affected and both sides need  an annuity put into the system.  Sale annuity to PPM and a purchase annuity for PNGC.  The sale is LT NW and the purchase is ST NW.

Diana,

Here is the same question I had the other day.  When we have a cut and  the purchase side of the deal  is ST NW and on the sale side the deal is LT NW how do you want us to enter the annuities.  If I put them on one book then we should be fine.

Doesn't the 10 NERC days mean we start delivering on Jan. 16th, not the 15th?

Luzenac has suspended its contract for 10 NERC business days, starting Jan. 1.  Therefore, we will not schedule power to Luzenac during this time, or charge Luzenac damages.

A "NERC Business Day" is any day except for a Saturday, Sunday, or NERC holiday.  By my calculations, this means that we will resume deliveries on January 15th.

Andrea, you might confirm with these guys that they agree with this calculation of days.---sch

Subject:	Team 4 Congratulatory Lunch at Rock Bottom

Great work, team--we took the "total number of trips" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26


Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.

Hi John -

As we discussed earlier, this is the
information about the contract
Vanalco is attempting to resell.
The Contract Demand is 170 MW.  It
is currently divided among 3 POIs.
( 50 MW at Chelan/RRH, 50 MW at
Slatt/Boardman, and 70 MW at the
US/Canadian Border.)  The POD is
Alcoa substation, near Vanalco's
facility.  Without a notice for
change in these points, the demand
would have to be used on a nonfirm
basis.  The value, of course, would
be in the discounted price you could
achieve for the demand.  If you have
a high load factor usage, it may be
very economical.

Vanalco would consider offers
consistent with the secondary
transmission market, subject to the
process they are going through in
the courts, but their objective is
to preserve the asset for the
future.

The term of the contract begins Oct
1, 2001 and terminates Sept 30, 2002
(1 year), but rollover rights exist
which have some value.  They would
expect some recall rights in the
event of production at the smelter,
but the notice period could be a
number of months.  Let me know what
you think.  If you are not
interested, do you know of a party
who might either buy or manage this
contract?

Thanks,

Bob

Melba,

Sean sat down with Christian and I and explained his proposed product.  The=
 product works like this:  EPMI and a counterparty agree on a day-ahead bas=
is to a quantity of power, a price for that power, a delivery point, and th=
e hours at which the power will be scheduled.  The seller does not schedule=
 the power as a day-ahead schedule, however.  Instead, the supplier schedul=
es the power on a real time basis on the day of delivery.  I made a small m=
odification to Sean's proposed definition, which I think will clear up any =
ambiguity.  With this change, Christian and I approve of the definition of =
the product.

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=

t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Up to 11/26/01, 
1. we are missing the annuities for 11/7, 11/18, 11/19, 11/22, 11/23, and 11/24
2. we need to restore HE23-24 for deal# 517676.1 for 11/2/01 (lightload sale in NP15) in scheduling

Please let me know if you need any help entering the annuities or restoring the HE23-HE24 scheduling (for 11/2/01 for deal 517676.1).

As the month-end is approaching, I am hoping we can clear the above issues up before Settlements captures the wrong P&L.

Thanks,

Yes Sean, leg 3 is only for peak for 8/6/01-9/30/01 and premium for leg 3 is $2/MWh. 
PS. The $5/MWh premium for the original leg 1 is already liquidated and paid off.

Just a clarification.  The new leg 3 is just for onpeak (correct?), and the premium is $2 total, not in addition to premium of first deal.  Is this correct?

Stewart,

Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:

* original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01. 
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.  All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.

I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Diana,

I heard back from Gwen and she has given me these deals to be fixed according to Modesto's spreadsheet.

Sales
875830.1.2 and 875819.2 Need to have a price of $29.00 11/7-11/30

Purchases
875830.3 and 875819.3 Need to have a price of $31.00 11/7-11/30

The deals above total 15,200 mw's.   The deals that could be the problem are  transmission deal 860363.1 at a $0.00 and Purchase annuities 859311.1 and 859389.1 @ $1.36, these deals total 15,200 mw's.

Also, starting on the 7th we need to put in losses of 36 mw's per day using the Dow NP15 index price.

let me know if you have any questions and what I can do to help.

Good Afternoon,

I would like to find out where we stand on a year-end market adjustment for Donald to match what he has been offered by BPA.  He is struggling and I would like to give him some kind of hope.

I would also like your opinion on whether you think it would be more beneficial for him to stay in the Specialist pool or to try for the Sr. Specialist pool.

Thanks,

Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C p=
hysical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

Subject:=09Day Ahead "Financial" Parking/Lending product

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Donald,

I've basically just taken the paths apart that were scheduled for the 2nd and moved them down.  The only new thing is airproducts comes back into play on Thursday, a flat 6 mw. at the midc.

Sean has been adjusting the california stuff daily, and maybe moving more midc to cob or visa versa to avoid so much going to cali in case of congestion. 

If you have any questions, or if things get crazy, please don't hesitate to call me, I can come in if needed.  Otherwise, I'll plan on seeing you on the 7th.

Sean, I am working with Nikolay in Enpower IT (Bill Crook's and Will Smith's group) on this project.  They advised the week after next week they shall give us something to test on.  I will update you on that when it happens.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,

I am told that ISO disbursed to participants the CERS monies it received last week for trade month Februrary '01 for approx. $404 million.  Every week another month is supposed to be processed but I beleive Feb was the biggest month.

Here's the update on our Montana customers.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Ash Grove:  They are still under contract suspension, and are planning on suspending until the end of the month.  Plan on delivering power starting Feb. 1.
Holnam:  We should be continuing to try to schedule, they will refuse thru Jan., so we should be invoicing accordingly.  They will start accepting the schedule for Feb. 1 delivery.
Luzenac:  They have terminated their contract as of 1/9/02.  So do not deliver power to them.
LP:  Schedule as usual.  They are looking at buyout of their contracts, but in the meantime, they want power delivered.

Yesterday we received a letter from BPA under which BPA terminated two of its agreements.  Ed, Harlan and I discussed some aspects of this earlier today.

Some additional information that Steve Hall and I just discussed is summarized below.

The effect of this termination on our power scheduling is that the West Desk is now short by 202 MW over its earlier position.  

After termination the contract positions are:

 COB:  		150 MW on peak (purchase from BPA)
		200 MW off-peak (purchase from BPA)

 Mid-C:		(339) MW on peak (delivery to BPA)
		(238) MW off peak (delivery to BPA)

Terminated contract numbers:

	97 PB-10123  (Wauna/James River)
	98 PB-10277 (Firm Power Sale)

The termination fo the Wauna/James River contract presumably also terminates the "book out" agreement negotiated earlier this year, and increases our net short position to BPA.

You guys might be slightly interested in this one - I'd imagine he's not planning on transferring to the Houston office any time soon.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=

To reflect Chris Calger's changes:

I have updated the list to reflect all changes received. If you notice any more errors or if any counterparties have been reassigned, please let me know so that I can continue to make changes.
Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers.
Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right.
Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms. 

Please call me at 5-3614 if you have any questions or come by my desk at 06541.

Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000 
 Power: Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one year's experience in the field. State officials say she is doing a good job. 


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. 
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. 
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. 
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. 
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. 
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. 
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. 
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. 
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. 
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. 
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said. "Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]." 
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. 
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said. "David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula." 
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries," according to her contract. 
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. 
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. 
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. 
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. 
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. 
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. 
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. 
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. 
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. 
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. 
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job." 
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. 
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. 
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. 
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months.

Scott:

Thanks again for giving Ray and I a tour of your Market Observation Center on Monday

Attached are the figures I presented on Monday at the technical conference.  They will be filed with the Commission shortly.  I am sending them to you today, however,  in the hope that either your staff or the external auditor could look at this ATC issue as soon as possible.

To recap our issue: The amount of transmission capability available for day-ahead cash markets dropped precipitously in 2001 for no apparent reason such as transmission de-rates.  The reason we have been told informally by CAISO  is that NP15-to-COB ATC (i.e., COB S-N) was reduced to improve capability on Path 15 S-N (i.e. congestion between SP15 and NP15). However, the only reason we could find to explain such a drop was the CAISO's effort to hold resources in NP15 to reduce the NP15 spot market price.  This is an admirable goal but such a goal cannot be acheive via arbitrary transmission derates.  Put another way, acheiving an economic goal in NP15 should not come at the expense of load in the PNW.

The .zip file contains all the data that was used to prepare the charts and includes explanatory notes on how we computed the ATC value after CAISO revised their OASIS site beginning mid-2001.

Either Ray or I will call you in the next week to see if you were able to view this data and understand it.

Again thank you for your help.

Steve,

Following up on our conversations today, attached is a draft fact sheet and our contract with PGE for 180 MW of capacity on the Intertie.  Because the contract is in the money both today and on an expected future basis, Belden and Calger recommend continued demand-charge payments to retain the contract's  value to the estate.  Based on my reading, the contract is assignable either to a third party or Netco.  If we default, the capacity would revert to PGE and PGE would sell it at a maximum of its tariffed rate, which is what EPMI pays today.

Diana -

  I have the following charges on BPA's revised final bills and was wondering if you could tell me who's books these should go on?


  October 2000	  $ 3,214
  February 2001   $ 4,153

  I spoke with Corrine Surface at BPA and learned that these charges are being applied given the following situation:

  On October 10, 2000 and February 1, 5, and 6, 2001, our Real-Time group called BPA to reserve transmission for some schedules.  Our R-T guys requested tranny using account numbers (such as 794811) that were for day-ahead firm transmission, thus entering the field of Unauthorized Increase Charges (incurred at $12,000/MWh) .  Since BPA did not go over the structure of the product in that account, they are not going to charge us the $12,000 per MWh, but since we did get firm transmission, we will have to pay the $59/Mwh for the firm; hence the above charges.

  I understand that you have also spoken with Corrine at BPA and were going to talk to Bill.  Can you let me know where these charges need to go? 

  (Bill - Diana is out this week, so if you have already talked to her about this, please let me know)

  Thanks,
  
  Virginia

We also need a box that says "Include only Dart Deals"


Please also  make absolutely sure that this is included in the PSW build route, as we use it nearly exclusively now.Vish knows about our problems with that.

Cara:

Please see the attached email below for what IT is planning to modify Build Routing report to accomodate and differentiate DART products.  From what we've discussed, you would like to have the default as with the "exclude DART deals" checked, right?  Also, did you also say you want IT to create another function for this report to run DART deals only (so the report will only show DART products) so real time schedulers can run it to see what he/she needs to pick up?

Fran,

We worked on excluding the DART deals from the BuildRoute report.
The report will look like that:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 
If you have the "Exclude DART deals" box unchecked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP1_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 
Deal 500056.1 is a DART deal.

If you have "Exclude DART deals" box checked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP2_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 

Please let me know if that's what you need to see.
I can send you similar files that show more then 3 deals.

Thanks!
Nikolay

	The change would not take long provided if we could easily identify DART deals.  At this point we will have to research identifying DART deals.  We don't know the answer yet.  There is a higher priority project (secondary legal entities) which we hope to complete next week.  We'll schedule this change after that.

EOL IT group (Torrey Moorer) has created a new DART product for us in testing stage.  We will need the Build Route Reports to be revised accordingly (please see the attached emails).  Would you have someone in your group work on this and let us know the timeline so we can follow up.  Please call me if you have any questions.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

For the past several weeks, we have been working diligently to receive the parking subsidy from Houston.  However, due to the bankruptcy filing Enron has not been able to process checks.  

For the month of December, you will be personally responsible for your parking. This includes all parking lots (Lot 108, Lot 303, the WTC parking garage) and any parking validations.  

If you have been parking in Lot 108, Lot 303 or Lot 2WTC, your responsibility begins 12/1/01.  For those parking in other lots, we will be unable to reimburse employees for the month of December.

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, we will stop the deduction on the 12/31/01 pay period.  Grace and I are working on a resolution plan for the monies that were deducted incorrectly, so please be patient as we work through the various issues. 

It has not been determined whether Enron will continue to subsidize parking but you will be notified as soon as we receive information from Corporate.

We sincerely apologize for the insufficient notice and the inconvenience that this may have caused.  Again, thank you for the patience.  We are all trying to do our best in a difficult situation!

Hello, Everyone -

This notice confirms the review session next week on December 19, 2001, at
the Kingstad Conference Center first floor meeting room.  The Kingstad
Conference Center is located at 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive, about three miles
east of the Portland Airport.  The meeting will begin at 8:30 a.m. and end
by 12:30 p.m.

The purpose of the meeting is to "walk through" preliminary rough drafts of
write-ups on Congestion Management, Pricing, and Facilities Inclusion.  We
are presenting these preliminary rough drafts together because of the
interest expressed at the last RRG meeting to see how these interrelated
concepts work together.  We are not planning to walk through the drafts on
Planning and Market Monitoring because they have been extensively discussed
at previous RRG and Content Group meetings.  But we will be prepared to
discuss any questions about them.  The preliminary rough drafts on all of
these subjects will be posted on the RTO West website - www.rtowest.org -
before the meeting, and we will send a notice to you when they are available
on the website.

Because this review meeting is open to members of the various content groups
as well as the RRG, I will send this notice to several exploder lists.
Therefore, some of you who are on multiple lists will get duplicative copies
of this notice.  Please feel free to vent your annoyance with me about this
at the December 19 meeting.  We'll also provide a schedule for completing
work on the March 1 filing to FERC at the December 19 meeting.

We look forward to seeing you next week on December 19.

- Bud

Hi Kevin,

I think this answers our question. Lets go ahead and get it through legal.

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=
ad DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would =
mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off=
peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=
rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i=
t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=
rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Sean,

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this aft=

Kevin

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Sel=
ler shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of firm energy equal=
 to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price. The Contract Price shall be =
as submitted by the Counterparty via the Web Site.  "Firm energy" is power =
that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent=
 rules adopted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council for which the on=
ly excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) =
due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreem=
ent; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory=
 obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the =
underlying agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that governs this tra=
nsaction (the "Agreement"), if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to m=
eet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsibl=
e for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in =
the applicable cover remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  "WSPP Agreement" =
means the Western System Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in th=
e Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of power at Mid Columbia.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Con=
tractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hou=
rs (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicab=
le hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak ("Peak") hours on each Delivery Day beginnin=
g with the hour ending 0700 (6:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2=
200 (10:00 pm) Pacific Prevailing Time.  "Delivery Day" means a day during =

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Sean:

I have been looking at the -$141K P&L hit in "Other Changes" on 8/13/01 you were inquiring about.  The biggest "contributor" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.

Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.  

I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.  In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks,
Fran

Judy Cochran (Brian)    503.656.8659

I'll have my cell phone, but it doesn't get good reception right at the convent.
If you need to get ahold of me quickly, you can call Father Theodore and get the number of the convent.  His number is 503.292.3737 @ church; 503.641.2370 @ home.  (His wife's name is Stacy, in case you've forgotten).
 
I'll print this out and leave it at home.  I'll also call you and make sure you got it.
Finally, I'm going to put the Voice-mail # you need to call into the phone (speed dial #2) -- then you just need to enter the security code.
 
See you tomorrow.  I love you.

All:

We (EPMI) has requested to be on this FERC workshop agenda.  I am interested in rebutting the presumption that when a cold wave comes to PNW that prices only rise in that region. I may need some help pulling some data showing that prices are correlated throughout the region.  Thus if you do not raise cap region wide (or assure export capacity through CAISO) you won't get the power to where its needed.

FERC To Discuss Possible Changes To West Pwr Price Caps
    
Updated: Thursday, October 18, 2001 08:16 AM ET 

(This article was originally published Wednesday) 

By Jason Leopold and Andrew Dowell 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators said this week they will discuss possible changes to price controls the agency imposed on western wholesale power markets in June. 

Western utilities complained that the price controls, based on the price of generating power in California, aren't appropriate for the entire region. In particular, demand in the Northwest rises sharply in the winter, while California's power demand and cost are typically highest in the summer. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in a notice its Oct. 29 meeting discussions could include an elimination of the 10% premium allowed for sales into California and changes to the way the price caps are adjusted.
T
 he price cap is set at about $92 a megawatt-hour and is calculated by taking the 85% of the most expensive hourly price during the most-recent Stage 1 power emergency in California, when operating reserves fall below 7%. 

Gov. Gray Davis lobbied hard for FERC to impose price caps throughout the entire western U.S., saying generators would sell their power to other western states if California were the only state with price controls. 

"The governor would be very disappointed if FERC contributed to additional economic uncertainty, particularly in these troubling times" if the agency were to lift the price restrictions, said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. 

Last summer, Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP, news, msgs) unit Nevada Power was forced to initiate rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for about 45 minutes because of the new price caps imposed on the market by FERC and blistering heat, said Paul Heagen, Sierra Pacific's chief spokesman.
I
 n addition, some generators, including a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), scrapped plans to build small power plants, the so-called peaking units used when demand for electricity is at its highest, in the western U.S. because of the price controls.
