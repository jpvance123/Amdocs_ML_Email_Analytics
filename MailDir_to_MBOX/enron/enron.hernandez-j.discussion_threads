Any weather deals that you see that have WS and then a two-digit number need 
to be sent back to have our number written on them.  They should be returned 
to Celeste Cisneros.  I am not sure where she is located, but if you happen 
to find any of these, just ask and whoever does the run will make sure they 
go to the proper location.

Thank you!
Brenna

>THE HAND
>--------------------------------
>My daughter, Kathleen, was 15... too young to seriously date but she had
>a boyfriend. One evening, when I was leaving to pick up my son, Paul,
>from baseball practice, she asked if she could just go with her
>boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friend's house. She said
>they would come right back.
>I said, "All right, just make sure you wear your seat belt, and come
>right home." It was my father's birthday and my youngest
>daughter,Therese, was already at my father's house waiting for us to
>come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store. I left to
>pick Paul up at school, but decided to take the highway, rather than the
>shortcut along the back roads.
>After leaving the school, Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and
>some last minute goodies. As we were getting into the car, we heard and
>saw paramedics, fire trucks, three ambulances and of course a multitude
>of police cars. ? I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul,
>"Somebody needs our prayers, quick." ? I wondered if there was a fire
>or a bad car accident.
>At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles
>through, and prayed, "Lord, those people need you right now, go to them
>and place your protective hand over them."
>We stopped at my parents to drop off the food, before going home to pick
>up Kathleen, but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the
>Party because Therese had fallen asleep.
>"Which way did you go to the school?" he asked, "Because there was a bad
>accident on the back road, I heard someone was killed. It happened just
>about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you
>always go that way. I was so happy to see you pull in, I had a gut
>feeling it was you."
>As Paul and I drove the short distance home, I could see our house was
>dark and when Kathleen is home alone, she always burned every light. As
>I turned off the ignition, tears fell, "It was Kathleen," I told Paul,
>"I know it." I ran in the house and checked our answering machine, no
>one
>had called. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that someone would
>have called by now. "Paranoid," that's what Kathleen always called me,
>and that's what I was telling myself, "You're just paranoid!" Then, the
>phone rang. It was her friend's mother, who worked in the emergency room
>of our local hospital. She only told me that the three of them were in
>an accident and were being transported to the hospital.
>I didn't call my husband at work, or my parents. Paul and I just left
>for the hospital. As I pulled into the parking lot, one of the
>paramedics, someone we have known for years met us at our car.
>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," he said with tears streaming down his face.

Below are some "points to ponder" that will help anyone with the daily 
challenges we face getting through life, and choosing to enjoy life rather 
than just going through the paces.

 And, it most cases, this type of wisdom will do more for our lives than any 
degree could. 
                     From one who is "still learning"...... 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------

I Have Learned...
  I've  learned....
         that the best  classroom in the world
         is at the  feet of an elderly person.

  I've  learned....
         that when you're in  love, it shows.

  I've  learned....
        that just one person  saying to me,
         "You've made my  day!" makes my day.

 I've  learned....
        that I feel better  about myself when
         I make others  feel better about themselves.

  I've  learned....
         that having a child  fall asleep in your
         arms is one of  the most peaceful
         feelings in the  world.

  I've  learned....
         that what we have done  for ourselves
        alone dies with us.  What we have done
         for others and  the world remains and
         is  immortal.

  I've  learned....
         that one sincere  apology is worth more
         than all the  roses money can buy.

  I've  learned....
         that words harshly  spoken are as difficult
         to  retrieve as feathers in a gale.

 I've  learned....
         that being kind is  more important than
         being  right.

 I've  learned....
         that you should never  say no to a
        gift from a  child.
  I've  learned....
        that I can always pray  for someone when
         I don't have the  strength to help him
        in some other  way.

  I've learned....
          that no matter how serious your  life
         requires you to be, everyone  needs a
         friend to act goofy  with.

 I've  learned....
        that sometimes all a  person needs is a
        hand to hold and  a heart to understand.

 I've  learned....
         that simple walks with  my father around
        the block on  summer nights when I was
         a child  did wonders for me as an adult.

 I've  learned....
         that life is like a  roll of toilet paper.
         The closer  it gets to the end, the
         faster it  goes.

 I've  learned....
         that we should be glad  God doesn't
         give us everything we  ask for.

 I've  learned....
         that money doesn't buy  class.

 I've  learned....
         that it's those small  daily happenings
         that make life so  spectacular.

 I've  learned....
         that once a  relationship is over,
        if you  experienced more smiles than
          tears, then it wasn't a waste of time.

 I've  learned....
        that under everyone's  hard shell is
         someone who wants to  be appreciated
         and  loved.

  I've  learned....
         never to humiliate  another person.
         Always give him an  honorable way to
         back down or out  of something and
         still save  face.

  I've  learned....
         that the Lord didn't  do it all in one
         day. What makes  me think I can?

  I've  learned....
         that if you are still  talking about
         what you did  yesterday, you haven't
         done much  today.

  I've  learned....
         that to ignore the  facts does not
         change the  facts.

  I've  learned....
         that when you plan to  get even with
        someone, you are  only letting that
         person continue  to hurt you.


  I've  learned....
        that it is best to  give advice in only
         two  circumstances; when it is  requested
         and when it is a  life-threatening
         situation.

  I've  learned....
         that a good friend is  the one who tells
        you how you  really look in your jeans.

  I've  learned....
        that the less time I  have to work with,
         the more things  I get done.

  I've learned. . .
      That poetry is not just words but feelings

 I've learned. . .
      helping people in need is the best thing we
      ever could do.

 I've learned , , .
      life is not what you acheived, or winning
      but the many times you have lended an ear,
      a hand, and a heart.

 I've learned,
      that no matter what education you attain,
     how many diplomas you gained.
      doesnt mean you can understand everyhting.

 I'ver learned,
      that the more pain and hurt you experience
      the more knowledgeable and understanding you are.

 I've, learned. . .  I am learning

Juan,
Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and 
Sunday the 22nd and work days on Thurs & Fri the 26 & 27.  I can't take 
Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be 
very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is 
acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans.

Doug

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way,
she
did what she could o help her 3-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new
sibling. They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl, and day
after
day, night after
night, Michael sang to his sister in Mommy's tummy. He was building a bond
of
love with his little sister before he even met her.  The pregnancy
progressed
normally for Karen of Morristown, Tennessee. In time, the labor pains came.
Soon
it was every five minutes, every three ...every  minute.  But serious
complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of
labor.
Would a C-section be required?  Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's
little
sister was born. But she was in very serious condition.  With a siren
howling in
the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care
unit
at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville, Tennessee.

The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell
the
parents,  "There is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst." Karen and
her
husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. They had fixed up a
special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves
having to plan for a funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to
let
him see his sister. "I want to sing to her," he kept saying.  Week two in
intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over.
Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed
in
Intensive Care.

Karen made up her mind, though. She would take Michael whether they liked it
or
not! If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive.
She
dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU.  He looked
like
a walking laundry basket. But the head nurse recognized him as a child and
bellowed, "Get that kid out of here now! No children are allowed."
The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady
glared
steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line.
"He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!"
Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant
losing
the battle to live.  After a moment, he began to sing. In the pure-hearted
voice
of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you
make
me happy when skies are gray >>---"
>>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm
down
and become steady. "Keep on singing, Michael," encouraged Karen with tears
in
her eyes.
"You never know, dear, how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine
away-"
As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became
as
smooth as a kitten's purr. "Keep on singing, Sweetheart!" "The other night,
dear, as I lay
sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms..."
>>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest,seemed to
sweep
over her.  "Keep on singing, Michael."  Tears had now conquered the face of
the
bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only Sunshine.
Please
don't, take my sunshine away..."
>>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go
home!  Woman's Day Magazine called it "The Miracle of a Brother's Song." The
medical staff just called it a miracle.
Karen called it a miracle of God's love!

 NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!

This is the power of prayer at work.  Let's continue to pray for
one another.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass
on
the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing that you are
a
child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul
the
freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there for each and
every
one of you. Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer.
Also,
read Phil 4:13

Cool Site of the Day

 


Adam Sandler's new movie, "Little Nicky," hits theaters this weekend and it 
turns out it's a 19th Century British period piece. Just kidding. To get the 
skinny on the flick, head over to its devil-themed Web site. Download screen 
savers and desktop wallpaper, watch the trailer, play Devil's Hangman and 
read up on the cast, crew and storyline. Nice looking and lots of fun, this 
site would make Little Nicky very proud. www.littlenicky.com

Fact of the Day

 


In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery while similar ceremonies were also held in England and 
France. These memorial services all took place on Nov. 11 to commemorate the 
anniversary of the end of World War I (Nov. 11, 1918). This day of 
remembrance became known as Armistice Day and on June 1, 1954, the name was 
changed to Veterans Day to honor all U.S. veterans. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Starbuckaroo  

The gal was in a coffee shop, surveying the establishment's menu. After 15 
minutes, the counter guy got impatient.  

"How about this?" he asked, jabbing his finger at the menu item, "latte."  

"Nooo," said the blond slowly, "I need to have it early."

Thought For Today: "Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you 
should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the 
pose, and then where are you?" - Fanny Brice, actress and singer (1891-1951).

-Hi,
I'm in Denver CO enjoying darla, Donna and Sean and our grand kids Faith
and Jadon.  Calvin will be joining me on Sunday.  He will have to work at
the conference office on Monday and we will leave for home Monday evening
or Tuesday morning.??

Below is an updated message from Greg -- the twins father.  continue to
pray -- they may be going home soon.
Praise the Lord,
Barb

-----------------
Dear Friends,

Just a quick update to let you know that Charity did really well today
and the surgery went great.  Her wound was able to be fixed by bringing
the skin together.  We praise God that a skin graft was not needed!

The doctors are still talking about going home next week.  I'm ready.
Three weeks of hospital environment and food is plenty, plenty, plenty.

We continue to thank God for your prayers and support.  What an
unspeakable blessing you have all been to us.  We are truly indebted to
you.

PRAYER REQUESTS:

Please remember both Kathleen and Charity's eating.  Right now they are
being fed throuh a tube from nose to stomach.  The goal is to get them
off the tube and onto regular feedings by mouth.

Please also remember Vaneice, family, and me.  It has been a long haul.
We need the Lord Jesus to continue to carry us through.

Thanks,  God bless.

Greg

This is a very good person to know.





[IMAGE]

Today I met  a great new friend
Who knew me right away 
It was funny how she understood 
All I had to say 

She listened  to my problems
She listened to my dreams 
We talked about love and life 
She'd been there, too, it seems 

 I never once  felt judged by her
She knew just how I felt 
She seemed to just accept me 
And all the problems I'd been dealt 

She didn't  interrupt me
Or need to have her say 
She just listened very patiently 
And didn't go away 

I wanted her  to understand
How much this meant to me 
But as I went to hug her 
Something startled me 

I put my arms  in front of me
And went to pull her nearer 
And realized that my new best friend 
Was nothing but a mirror. 
[IMAGE]

True Friends are hard to come by. Your  first true friend should be yourself. 
Enjoy this poem about friendship  & pass it on to your friends.

FRCC

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon.

prayer requests forwarded to me this week.  There are so many hurting
people.  It is great to know the Great Physician, isn't it?!!!

Sorry so late.  I pray that you will remember this one thing:

"I am your refuge and your strength.  Even though the earth gives way and
the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, do not fear.  I am an ever
present help in trouble."
Psalm 46:1-3

60 Seconds for God

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed 
this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to 
pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This 
is a heads up on the situation.

Hourly traders and operators that need to see the overhead PI screens can now 
view them via the web regardless of where they are sitting.  They can be 
accessed through Internet Explorer from the new East Power Home Page, under 
the GENCO section.  Please contact Rick Broussard or Ramesh Swaminathan if 
you have trouble getting access.

They'll look a little different, but the information content is the same.

A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly 
after this started, she told him she was pregnant. Not 
wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a large 
sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the 
baby there. 

"But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she 
asked. 

He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 
'spaghetti' on the back." 

Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money 
and flew to Italy. Six months went by and then one day 
the doctor's wife called him at the office and 
explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard 
in the mail today and I don't understand what it 
means." 

The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and read 
it and I will explain it to you." 

Later that evening the doctor came home, read the 
postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack - and 
died. 

So the wife picked up the cord and read, "Spaghetti, 
Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - two with sausage and 
meatballs, two without."

You must have any requests for time off approved by either myself or Brenna.  
The sheet  that circulates from Sandy indicating days off during a particular 
month reflects approved days off - these days must be approved first before 
marking on this sheet.  If you have further questions please ask me or Brenna

Subject: A Visitor's Guide to Houston, TX




A VISITORS' GUIDE TO HOUSTON, TX

(To enable our many visitors to cope with life in
America's Fourth
Largest
City)

1. First you must learn to pronounce the city name. It
is YEWS-TUN and
it
does not matter how people pronounce it in other
places.

2. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere.
Houston has its own
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown
Houston is
composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out
of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas,
Texas.

3. All directions start with, "Go down Westheimer..."

4. Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

5. It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on
the street you
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a
"scenic drive".

6. The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The
5:00pm rush hour is
from
3:30 to 6:30pm. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday
morning.

7. If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot
be from Houston.

8. Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody.

9. Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native,
so do not
attempt the
phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their
heads to the
right and
stare at you.

10. The falling of one raindrop or (God forbid) one
snowflake causes
all
traffic to immediately cease; so will daylight savings
time and a girl
applying eye shadow across the street, or a flat tire
three lanes over.

11. Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life,
and a permanent
form
of entertainment.

12. Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by
uttering the
phrase,"Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

13. Construction crews aren't doing their job properly
unless they
close
down all lanes except one during rush hour.

14. If someone actually has their turn signal on, it
was probably left
on at
the factory where the car was made.

15. Understand that the 95 pound woman driving the
Ford Excursion (the
largest vehicle ever produced) absolutely MUST come to
a complete stop,
then
proceed at 2.5 mph over any railroad track. What's the
deal? This
vehicle
was built to invade small countries, and she's worried
about the
railroad
tracks!!!

16. All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or
Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

17. The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a
legal right to
turn
right from a left lane or to turn left from a right
lane. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED!

18. White haired men driving red or silver sports cars
will not
obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to
stop for red
lights or
stop signs.

19. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money
since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such
a manner as to
avoid
major road construction.

20. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money
since the
termination or continuation of any street is entirely
at the discretion
of
the Streets Department of the City. It has been
determined that the
length
of any street on any given day is a mystery known only
to "Higher
Powers" in
the department, and it is rumored that they do not
speak to mere
mortals.

21. Asking directions will help you get acquainted
with the numerous
recent
residents of an amazing ethnic diversity. It will be
not help at all
for
finding the address you seek.

22. If searching for a street on the southwest side of
Houston, a
knowledge of Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese is
somewhere between
helpful and
mandatory, since the street signs are printed in one
of these languages
along with English. However, often the English name
for the street has
been
removed.

23. Houston natives are so rare that they are listed
on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in
a controlled
environment for their own safety.

24 . "Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking
to you if
there's a
remote possibility that you're at least 30 minutes
older than they are.
You
can safely address anyone as "Sir" or "Ma'am" in
Houston as in other
southern cities.

25 . "Sugar" is a more common form of address than
"Miss". So is
"Honey" Do
not take offence. This is how southerners address
grown women.

26 . In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr. Pepper. It
is rumored that
other
soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to
knowing anyone who
actually drinks them. So don't ask for any other soft
drink.

27 . What you need to know when arriving at Bush
Intercontinental
Airport:
Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the
Main Concourse of
any
terminal. Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

28 . Wherever you are going will be on the other side
of town. When
attempting to cross Houston, assume the trip will take
a minimum of 4
hours
and can take as long as 24 hours.

29 . If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway
system, it is
advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola, water, a few
sandwiches, and
something to read while waiting on the freeway for the
traffic jam to
clear.
Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a
1,000 page novel
during the course of one traffic jam. If attempting to
cross Houston
during
rush hour,
additional provisions are advisable.

30 . Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a
restroom break
first!
It may be a long time to the next break.

31 . Never honk your horn at another car in Houston
traffic. The
bumpersticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm
reloading" is considered
fair
warning.

Mark emailed me the current Time Tracking sheet that you all are using.  I 
have revised it to include spaces for numbers of each type of commodity that 
you track.  This way, rather than estimating numbers of different commodities 
tracked each week, we can get true numbers for Carolyn each month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Brenna

ECAR
  
There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.   

 ECAR   FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 25.6   OFFER $ 27.5
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2 


MAIN

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule. 


 MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.1   OFFER $ 20.7
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $ 9.4   OFFER $ 15.7

	Did you ever wonder why one's retirement savings plan is called a 401(k)? 
With the creation of the Tax Reform Act of 1978, section 401, paragraph (k) 
of the Internal Revenue Code was developed. Under this section, Congress 
authorized the creation of a tax-deferred savings plan for employees. For

Subject: Toby & Cindy - new baby

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

Subject: Friends needing prayer

Dear Friends - Molly is a dear friend of mine and I know she and her
friends would appreciate your prayers. Pray for God's will in this
situation and His glory. Also for comfort and strength for Toby and Cindy.
Thanks for taking the time to do this. Kristy

MOLLY - I'LL BE PRAYING! KRISTY

From: "Molly Herb" <rmbl20@hotmail.com>

Good Morning:

I need each of you to be in prayer about some friends of ours.  Some of
you already know the situation, but they have asked that we pass the word
along.

They want everyone to be in prayer.

Toby and Cindy are expecting a baby and Cindy will be going in Tuesday
(11/28) to have the baby - c-section.  The baby has Anencephaly which
means, the way I understand it, the baby will be born with only a brainstem 
and no skull bone.  There are other malformations with this - possibly cleft
lip/palate, abnormalities of the hands and/or feet and other internal
malfunctions.  They have know this for quite a while and she has carried
the baby almost full term.  I think her actual due date is 12/10.  The baby
will die.  The way I understand it all babies born with this usually are
stillborn or die within hours or a few days after they are born.

To be truthful, I really don't know what to pray for.  I'm just praying
for comfort and peace for Toby and Cindy and the Lord's Will would be done.
I cannot even imagine what they are going through and we all have so much
to be thankful for.

Toby and Cindy just ask that everyone please be in prayer for them and
specifically pray on Tuesday, the 28th.  She goes to the dr. at 11:30.

There are some websites you can go to for more information.
www.asfhelp.com is a support foundation and there are numerous other websites 
under keyword "anencephaly".

Thanks for the prayers guys.  I know Toby and Cindy will feel them and
appreciate them.

Love all of you - Molly

FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.

prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   


SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.

Clint,

Here is the info on BTU (City of Bryan):

Contact: Tom Hancock - Mgr, Pwr Mktg Admin - Nice guy, easy to deal with, 
talk to

Phone: 512-965-5458 - This is his mobile.  All people who trade with him call 
him on this phone
 979-821-5812 - Office

1. Tom does mostly daily/hourly type deals - mostly he will buy vs. run - 
even if the price is a little higher than his cost to run
2. BTU has extra capacity to sell, but Tom says they can't move it out 
because of contrained elements in their system
3. Typically has no problem buying from the North - he does a lot of stuff 
with Brazos

Call me if you have questions.

Zach

Just to recap in writing....

When you are tracking faxed M-Deals, if you come across those that are not in 
Tagg or are in Tagg with an incorrect status, keep track of these numbers, 
email them to me and send the physical copy back to Laurel, not to Melissa. 
Please email these to me each day and I will email them to Laurel and 
Carolyn.  

Thanks for your help!

Brenna

Leslie, 
Per our conversation, Confirmation Letters that have an Attachment   Annex 
A-General Terms and Conditions ("GTC")...

If an Enron Confirmation Letter is returned to us executed (full signature, 
no changes made), but the Annex A is not attached, we do not have to see the 
document.  

We do have to see the Confirmation Letter if the Counterparty has made any 
changes what so ever, including strike throughs or trader name changes.  
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call. 

Thank you

Subject: saturday's action

FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.  
For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's 
prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   


SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.    

ecar
The utilities directly connected to the pool were
offering out power in the twenties for most of
saturday. AEP was a mid teen bid for Sat urday
morning, and was offering out mid twenties for the
afternoon. Sige and DPl were on the bid but wouldn't
pay more than low to mid 20's.

Main
CE was offering poer in the low twenties all day. We
actually bought $20 late in the afternoon. IP was flat
all day since we stole all their guys. AMRN was
offering power all day around 23. Lots of TLR's

Dear all-

Regarding PG&G Energy Trading - Power, L.P executed Enron Confirmation 
Letters:
PG&E tends to place a stamp (disclaimer) at the bottom of Enron 
confirmations, please execute the documents if nothing else has been altered, 
and has been signed by both counterparties.  I have asked Rhonda Denton in 
our group and she said it was a disclaimer.   If nothing else has changed and 
you all have proof read the stamp to make sure the stamp has not changed; we 
do not have to see the document through the Livelink process.  You all can 
track execute and file.
Please call with any questions.
Thank you
Stephanie  x39210

Stamp reads:
PG&E Energy Trading- Power, L.P. is not the same company as Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company, the utilty.  PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P. is not 
recognized by the California Public Utilities Commission and you do not have 
to buyPG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P.'s products in order to continue to 
receive quality regulated services from the utilty.

(Something to that effect the copy I have Deal 455280.01 is hard to read)

Here's a laugh for today:


In an emergency session of Congress, just completed, an official change to 
the name of one of the 50 United States will take place.  As of noon today, 
November 22, 2000 the state formerly known as Florida, will officially be 
renamed "Floriduh."  Please make  note  of the change.

>From Carol Word

Attached are the prayer requests for Wednesday, November 15.  Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:

Carol,

Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is "No, los dejes caer ententacion", interpreted as
"No, Let us not fall into temptation."  Or it can be "No, lead us not
into temptation."  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.

Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer.
---------------------
Here is what I feel explains it as well:

When Jesus commanded us to pray "Lead us not into temptation" He was
instructing believers to pray that forces beyond their own control would not
lead them into trials (see Matt 24:20, Revelation 3:10).  ;He is also
commanding believers to watch and pray against entering into temptation
through their own carelessness or disobedience (Matt 26:41, Luke 21:34; Luke
22:40, 46).

Jesus had warned Peter;  "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat" (Luke 22:31).  Knowing Satan's plans,
Jesus cautioned Peter to watch and pray lest he enter into temptation.  This
indicates that if Pete would have listened to Jesus, he would have remained
strong.

Jesus also knows our potential weaknesses.  He remembers we are dust (Ps
103:14).  He knows our human spirits may be willing, but our flesh is weak.
He realizes that we can give in to temptation as a result of our own
carelessness and disobedience, and Jesus knows of forces can circumstances
beyond our control that can come to try us.  Therefore, He lovingly commands
us to pray "Lead us not into temptation".

Jesus will not lead us there.  When we pray for His leadership, He leads us
away from it.  According to Strong's it is asking Him to make us strong and
be our guide.

There is more to it than only that which we can get into, and should most
definitely, later.

Have a safe, blessed Holiday and know I will be praying for all of you.  See
you next on Wednesday, November 29th when Juan Barba's wonderful Godly
mother will minister to us from a mother's heart.

God Bless you...Carol

Cool Site of the Day

 


Mr. Winkle is a real dog who lives in Los Angeles. And like everybody else in 
that city, he's really cute but something's a little off. Check Winkle out 
for yourself at his Web site and see if you agree. The exact breed of this 
phenomenal dog is unknown and the owner is obviously enjoying making money 
off of the fact - calendars, posters and "short films" have been created 
around him and are for sale at the site (naturally). Hear Mr. Winkle pant and 
bark as you roam around, and make sure to get a good, long look - you're not 
likely to see another dog like this ever again. www.mrwinkle.com

Attention Amigos, please read the following.

12/26/2000 Note -- PJM Pilot Program

PJM is implementing a pilot program effective 0900 Thursday, December 28, 
2000. 

PJM is reducing the time required to request a change to an existing 
interchange transaction and purchase hourly transmission from 30 to 20 
minutes. 
Changes to interchange transactions will continue to be guaranteed with 30 
minutes notice. 
Changes will be accommodated with 20 minutes notice on a best effort basis. 
To accommodate the reduced notification time for interchange transactions, 
transactions without a linked NERC Tag will not be approved until a Tag is 
linked. Transactions that remain untagged 20 minutes prior to the transaction 
start time will be rejected. As always, transactions without a NERC Tag will 
hold ramp.

TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m.  
We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for 
the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be 
started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for 
he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other 
bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them 
$24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only 
 offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much 
maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will 
again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have 
hourly to sell tomorrow.    

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2


FRCC

After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL 
would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL 
was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20.  
FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as 
yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying 
off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules.

Those days off are fine.  See if you can get the calendar and put your days 
on it.  I know that sounds backwards since you could have done it before, but 
this way we can all get into the habit of emailing, getting a response and 
then putting it on the calendar.  

Sorry for the confusion.

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

Subject: Enron Field/Houston Astros Tickets Announcement

As many of you know, the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching.  
Enron Field, the new 42,000 seat retractable roof ballpark, will make its 
debut when the Astros play host to the World Champion New York Yankees on 
March 30th and 31st.  The defending American League West Champion Texas 
Rangers travel to Houston on April 1st.  The Astros open the 2000 
Championship Season on the road before playing host to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the season opener on April 7th.

There have been numerous inquiries about how to secure tickets for Astros 
games at Enron Field.  A limited number of tickets have been allocated for 
Enron for these inaugural games.  However, we anticipate that the demand for 
tickets by employees will exceed this allocation.  In an effort to keep all 
of you informed, Astros tickets will be going on sale for the entire season 
to the general public for single-game tickets beginning this Saturday, 
January 29th at 9:00 a.m.  

 We recommend you secure personal tickets for the games of your choice 
through the traditional Astros ticket outlets listed below.  Enron will sell 
a significant portion of its allotted tickets to employees in late February; 
however, please remember that our supply of tickets is limited and will sell 
out quickly.

 March 30 vs. New York Yankees (Inaugural exhibition game)
 March 31 vs. New York Yankees
 April 1 vs. Texas Rangers
 April 7 vs. Philadelphia Phillies (Opening Day)

ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASES:
Tickets for all 84 home games, including three exhibition games, will be 
available at the Astrodome Box Office and the usual Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone may do so by calling (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also 
accessible on-line at  www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

A detailed follow up e-mail will be sent to provide more information on when 
and where the Enron tickets will be sold.  In addition, Astros tickets will 
be available to Enron employees throughout the season, and we will notify you 
of these opportunities.

Hi Juan

Per my previous e:mail below we have now assigned you your second requested 
intern (per Kevin Presto's earlier request to John Lavorato).    These Inters 
were on Kevin  Presto's actual selection of candidates for his world.   Their 
names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

Joseph Spector    Start date:   June 4th
Andrew Kandolha  Start date:  May 21st

The A&A Program will be in contact with your assistant to set up appropriate 
systems etc.

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria


 Friend



When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

 Subject: Some armor for the daily battles of life


The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small, uninhabited 
island.  He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned 
the horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming.  Exhausted, he eventually 
managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect himself from the 
elements, and to store his few possessions.  But then one day, after 
scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in flames, the 
smoke rolling up to the sky. The worst had happened; everything was lost. He 
was stunned with grief and anger.  "God, how could you do this to me!" he 
cried.  Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship 
that was approaching the island. It had come to rescue him.  "How did you 
know I was here?" asked the weary man of his rescuers.  "We saw your smoke 
signal," they replied.

It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad. But we shouldn't 
lose heart, because God is at work in our lives, even in the midst of pain 
and suffering. Remember, next time your little hut is burning to the ground-- 
it just may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God.  For all the 
negative things we have to say to ourselves, God  has a positive answer for 
it:

You say: "It's impossible"   --   God says:"All thing are possible" 
(Luke18:27)
You say: "I'm too tired"  --  God says:"I will give you rest" ( Matt11:28-20)
You say: "Nobody really loves me" -- God says:"I love you" (John 3:16 & 
John13:34)
You say: "I can't go on"  --  God says:"My grace is sufficient" (II Cor.12:9 
& Psalm 91:15)             You say: "I can't figure things out" -- God 
says:"I will direct your steps" (Proverbs 3:5-6)
You say: "I can't do it" -- God says:"You can do all things" (Phil 4:13)
You say: "I'm not able" -- God says:"I am able" (II Cor.9:8)
You say:"It's not worth it"  --  God says:"It will be worth it" (Romans 8:28)
You say: "I can't forgive myself"  --  God says:"I forgive you" ( I John 1:9 
& Romans 8:1)
You say: "I can't manage"  -- God says:"I will supply all your needs" (Phil 
4:19)
You say: "I'm afraid"  -- God says:"I have not given you a spirit of fear (II 
Tim. 1:7)
You say: "I'm always worried and frustrated"  --  God says:"Cast all your 
cares on ME" ( I Peter 5:7)
You say: "I don't have enough faith" -- God says: I've given everyone a 
measure of faith (Rom. 12:3)
You say: "I'm not smart enough"  -- God says "I give you wisdom (I Cor 1:30)
You say: "I feel all alone" -- God says:"I will never leave you or forsake 
you" (Heb. 13:5)

Pass this on, you never know whose life may be in need of this today.  I 
believe there are some weeks that we all feel our huts are burning.

Every once in a while a really good message gets circulated--this is one of
them!

A little boy is telling his Grandma how's everything is going wrong.
--------------------

School,
family problems, severe health problems, etc.

Meanwhile, Grandma is baking a cake.
She asks her grandson if he would like a snack, which of course he does.
"Here, have some cooking oil."

"Yuck" says the boy.

"How about a couple raw eggs? "

"Gross, Grandma!"

"Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking soda?"

"Grandma, those are all yucky!"

To which Grandma replies: "Yes, all those things seem bad all by themselves=
.
But when they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully
delicious cake! God works the same way. Many times we wonder why he would
let
us
go through such bad and difficult times.

But God knows that when He puts these things all in His order, they always
work for good!

We just have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something
wonderful!"  God is Crazy About You. If God had a refrigerator, your pictur=
e
would be on it.

If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every
spring and a sunrise every morning.

Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen. He can live anywhere in the
universe, and He chose your heart.

Face it, He's crazy about you.

SRRS Decommissioning Notification

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request=20
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security=20
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security=20
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and=20
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security a=
nd=20
Controls group is working to streamline Enron=01,s Security Request structu=
re=20
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest,=20
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:=
 =20

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt=
=20
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to=
=20
the new eRequest system. =20

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if=
=20
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information=
=20
Risk Management at 713.853-5536.=20


Thank you

A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later:
"Da-ad..."


"What?"

"I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a drink of water?"

"No. You had your chance. Lights out." Five minutes later:
"Da-aaaad..."

"WHAT?"

"I'm THIRSTY...Can I have a drink of water??"

"I told you NO! If you ask again I'll have to spank you!!"

Five minutes later... "Daaaa-aaaad..."

"WHAT??!!"

"When you come in to spank me, can you bring me a drink of water?"

OR IS IT FUNNY?




Funny how simple it is  for people to trash God ...
      and then wonder why the world's going to hell.

        Funny how we believe what the newspapers say,
       but question what the Bible says.

Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven
       provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the
Bible says.


Or is it scary?



       Funny how someone can say "I believe in God"
but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).

 Funny how you can send a thousand  'jokes' through e-mail
and they spread like wildfire,
but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord,
people think twice about sharing.

       Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through
cyberspace,
but the public discussion of Jesus
is suppressed in the school and workplace.


Funny, isn't it?


Funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday,
but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?


Funny how when you go to  forward this  message,
      you will not send it to too many on your address list because you're
not
sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to
them.


Funny how I can be more worried about what other people
think of me than what God thinks of me.


       Are you thinking?

      I'm thinking and I have the courage to send this...do you?

Subject: Update on deals

Hello Judy!

 Thanks for getting those Royal Bank deals out to me.  I checked with Melinda 
on the status of the J. Aron and Engage deals that we were still needing a 
copy of.  We looked into the J. Aron deal NE4572.1 and it was flagged as 
executed by Bob Bowen, and she was wondering if we will be requesting a copy 
of the deal from J.Aron since we don't have a copy.  She was also wondering 
if the status in TAGG will also be changed.  For the Engage deal NN3957.1 the 
status shows that is was sent to c/p June 21/00.  Jeff Sorenson said that 
there is a revision which he is currently doing, and we would need to ask him 
to send us a confirm.  There was a confirm sent to Engage Canda and a error 
letter was sent to Engage US.  Perhaps the status was never updated?  If you 
could look into this for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks again Judy

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?

SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon 
peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were 
sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 
30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a 
hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 
hours until TLR's ended the sale.  

 -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a 
low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an 
hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE 
and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday. 


FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state.  
FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much 
of Saturday.  

 -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's 
for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from 
going into Florida.  


ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went 
through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 
17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours.  
TU would not show us bid for these hours.  

 -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No 
transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North.

The government recently calculated the cost of raising a child from birth
to
18 and came up with $160,140.00 for a middle-income family.  Talk about
sticker shock. That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with
kids,
that figure leads to wild fantasies about all the things we could have
bought, all the places we could have traveled, all the money we could have
banked if not for (insert child's name here).  For others, that number
might
confirm the decision to remain childless.

But $160,140.00 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into
$8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a week. That's a mere $24.44 a
day.  Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial
advice says don't have children if you want to be rich.

It's just the opposite.  There's no way to put a price tag on:
Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump of a knee
rippling across your skin. Having someone cry, "It's a boy!" or shout,
"It's
a girl!" then hearing the baby wail and knowing all that matters is it's
healthy. Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the first time.  Feeling the
warmth of fat cheeks against your breast. Cupping an entire head in the
palm
of your hand. Making out dada or mama from all the cooing and gurgling.

What do you get for your $160,140.00?
Naming rights. First, middle and last.
Glimpses of God every day.
Giggles under the covers every night.
More love than your heart can hold.
Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.
Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds and warm cookies.
A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.
A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sandcastles and
skipping down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.  Someone to laugh yourself
silly with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that
day.

For $160,140.00, you never have to grow up.  You get to finger-paint, carve
pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs and never stop believing
in Santa Clause.  You have an excuse to keep reading the adventures of
Piglet and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney movies
and wishing on stars.

You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers under refrigerator magnets
and
collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay
for Mother's Day and cards with backward letters for Father's Day.

For $160,140.00, there's no greater bang for your buck.  You get to be a
hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the garage roof, taking the training
wheels off the bike, removing a sliver, filling the wading pool, coaxing a
wad of gum out of bangs and coaching a baseball team that never wins but
always gets treated to ice cream regardless.

You get a front-row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word,
first bra, first date, first time behind the wheel.  You get to be
immortal.
You get another branch added to your family tree, and if you're lucky, a
long list of limbs in your obituary called grandchildren.

You get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice,
communications and human sexuality no college can match.  In the eyes of a
child, you rank right up there with God.  You have the power to heal a
boo-boo, scare away monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a
slumber party, ground them forever and love them without limits, so one day
they will, like you, love without counting the cost.

	Once you've visited PatSajak.com, you can say you've seen everything. That's 
right - the riveting Wheel of Fortune host finally has his own site. We've 
all been waiting, sweating, biting our collective lip for this day to come 
and now it has arrived. So, you ask, what is the first thing I'm greeted with 
when I arrive? A Flash animation of Pat's smilin' mug. Click it once and 
you're in the middle of the challenging PatPuzzle, wherein you can rearrange 
the man's face (in the nice way). Then read Pat's newsletter which is 
chock-full of late-breaking headline news, a section dedicated to Pat's talk 
show (which is suspect, considering it lasted roughly 4 minutes on the air), 
find out how to make your big break by becoming a Wheel contestant, and learn 
about Pat's many many side projects. The web at its most compelling.

Brenna,

For Confirms in which a Counterparty writes a decimal number next to our 
Option Premium Dollar Amount, consider these Confirms ok to Execute unless 
the Premium is crossed out and a new dollar amount is noted.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

Would you mind emailing your message to me regarding the numbers written in 
on the confirmations?  I head the voice mail that you left for Eve, and I 
would like to try to keep written documentation of these things as well.  
Just something short would be fine whenever you have a chance.

Thanks for your help Joe.

Brenna

THANKS, BEFORE & AFTER

     I never intended to tell you anything about this, but since I became
an adult I discovered that the meaning of Thanksgiving sure isn't what it
used to be.
     When I was younger, I remember receiving the inevitable homework
assignment to write an essay on "Something I Am Thankful For".  Then, I'd
spend a lot of time sitting in my room trying to figure out just what in
the world that could possibly be, and I'd end up writing down everything I
could think of from God to environmental consciousness.
     But after having children, my priorities have clearly changed.

     Before children:  I was thankful to have been born in the United
States of America -- the most powerful, free, democracy in the world.
     After children:  I am thankful for Velcro tennis shoes.  As well as
saving valuable time, now I can hear the sound of my son taking off his
shoes which gives me three extra seconds to activate the safety locks on
the backseat windows right before he hurls them out of the car and onto the
freeway.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the recycling program that will
preserve our natural resources and prevent the overflowing of landfills.
     After children:  I am thankful for swim diapers because every time my
son wanders into water in plain disposables, he ends up wearing a blimp the
size of, say, New Jersey, on his bottom.

     Before children:  I was thankful for fresh, organic vegetables.
     After children:  I am thankful for microwavable macaroni and cheese --
without which my children would be surviving on about three bites of cereal
and their own spit.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to obtain a
college education and have a higher quality of life than my ancestors.
     After children:  I am thankful to finish a complete thought without
being interrupted.

     Before children:  I was thankful for holistic medicine and natural herbs.
     After children:  I am thankful for any pediatric cough syrup
guaranteed to "cause drowsiness" in young children.

     Before children:  I was thankful for all of the teachers who had
taught, encouraged, and nurtured me throughout my formative years.
     After children:  I am thankful for all of the people at Weight
Watchers who let me strip down to pantyhose and a strategically placed
scarf before getting on the scale each week.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to vacation in
exotic foreign countries so I could experience a different way of life in a
new culture.
     After children: I am thankful to have time to make it all the way down
the driveway to get the mail.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the Moosewood Vegetarian Cookbook.
     After children:  I am thankful for the Butterball turkey hotline.

     Before children:  I was thankful for a warm, cozy home to share with
my loved ones.
     After children:  I am thankful for the lock on the bathroom door.

     Before children:  I was thankful for material objects like custom
furniture, a nice car, and trendy clothes.
     After children:  I am thankful when the baby spits up and misses my
good shoes.

     Before children:  I was thankful for my wonderful family.
     After children:  I am thankful for my wonderful family.

2001. Aging Gen X'ers may remember the 1970s Hanna-Barbera "Pussycat" series, 
on which Cheryl Ladd of "Charlie's Angels" fame provided the singing voice 
for ditsy drummer Melody Valentine. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Accouting for Taste 

The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after 
working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing 
applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in 
a resume.  

After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years 
experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the 
woman what 2 plus 2 was.  

She answered, "Four."  

Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.  

The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview 
he was asked the same question, "What is two and two?"  

The CPA replied, "Four." Cheatham told him that he would call the young man 
if he was selected.  

The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured 
that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, "What the hey? I've got 
nothing to lose."  

He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, "I know you don't have an 
accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?"  

To which the philosophy major replied, "Can you tell me what would you want 
it to be?"  

And was hired on the spot.

Falling in love.
Laughing so hard your face hurts.
Hot shower.
No lines at the Super Walmart.
A special glance.
Getting mail.
Taking a drive on a scenic road.
Hearing your favorite song on the radio.

The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.

  "I went to a party, Mom"

  I went to a party,
  and remembered what you said.
  You told me not to drink, Mom
  so I had a sprite instead.

  I felt proud of myself,
  the way you said I would,
  that I didn't drink and drive,
  though some friends said I should.

  I made a healthy choice,
  and your advice to me was right
  as the party finally ended,
  and the kids drove out of sight.

  I got into my car,
  sure to get home in one piece,
  I never knew what was coming, Mom
  something I expected least.

  Now I'm lying on the pavement,
  And I hear the policeman say,
  The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,"
  Mom, His voice seems far away.

  My own blood's all around me,
  as I try hard not to cry.
  I can hear the paramedic say,
  This girl is going to die."

  I'm sure the guy had no idea,
  while he was flying high,
  because he chose to drink and drive,
  now I would have to die.

  So why do people do it, Mom
  Knowing that it ruins lives?
  And now the pain is cutting me,
  like a hundred stabbing knives.

  Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
  tell daddy to be brave,
  and when I go to heaven,
  put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave.

  Someone should have taught him,
  that its wrong to drink and drive.
  Maybe if his parents had,
  I'd still be alive.

  My breath is getting shorter, Mom
  I'm getting really scared.
  These are my final moments,
  and I'm so unprepared.

  I wish that you could hold me Mom,
  as I lie here and die.
  I wish that I could say I love you, Mom
  So I love you and good-bye.

Dear juan,

FriedWire Inc has just released a new version of our Traffic Report.  Below 
is a snapshot of the new content:


NEW EMERGENCY MAPS-
We have added more than a hundred transmission elements (e.g. flowgates, 
transformers, power plants now totaling over 500!)
to our geographic representation of TLR's and other market-moving 
announcements.  To handle the increased resolution, we
have developed two new maps that replace the Emergency Constraints map, 
providing even more information for users to easily
digest in a color-coded, geographic snapshot.

Now, the Emergency (TLR) map shows the entire U.S. with small white dots in 
the background that represent all the flowgates
that are experiencing satisfactory conditions.  Overlaid are larger 
color-coded dots signaling the flowgates that have some
TLR level associated with them.  The new TLR map will have greater 
differentiation than the old one, with TLR levels from 1
to 6 represented.  When you click on one of the colored dots, you will see 
the name of the element and the TLR level in a
pop-up box.  The Market Notices map still has the regions colored when there 
is a market notice associated with them.  You
can click on a region and get a pop-up text box with the full text of the 
regional notice.


CALIFORNIA ISO-
We have added the ability to look at the system frequency for a day or an 
hour in the Frequency Monitoring in WSCC
(deviation from 60Hz) area of the System Summary page.

We have also added Generator Outages in California.  This lists all generator 
outages, including unplanned and planned, with
additional data fields detailing the name, owner, and zone of curtailed units 
plus the amount of capacity affected.


POWER FLOWS-
We now have more information displayed on the time series flow graph for each 
intertie on the Intertie Profile screen under
the Power Flows tab.

When a transmission line or intertie is affected by a TLR request, the black 
line on the time series graph (which represents
flow under normal conditions) is overlaid with a bold color corresponding to 
what TLR the line is experiencing.  Thus, the
historical context provided by the graph for intertie flow over the past day, 
week, month, or year, is even more intuitive
and informational with the help of easy-to-read color coding, reflecting TLR 
history as far back as a year.  If you want
more information about the intertie's past TLR's, simply scroll down to the 
history of market notices associated with that
physical transmission element.

We have also revisited the ways in which flow direction can be interpreted.  
We now provide a clear picture of the magnitude
AND direction of power.

1.)  In the power flow time series graph, the limit of the intertie and the 
flow on the intertie will now always show
consistent signs.

2.)  In the Power Flow Data table above the graph, the Flow MW will always 
appear positive.  This flow magnitude is in fact,
the absolute value of the flow.  The Flow Direction, the left-most data field 
on this row, is dynamic.  If the flow changes
directions, the text within that field will be modified accordingly.

3.)  The third place to get an immediate and intuitive sense of direction of 
power flow is in the map to the left of the
graph on the Intertie Profile.  The arrow will always correspond to real-time 
direction of power flow.

Look forward to a major new release soon.  We'll soon be rolling out links to 
all OASIS nodes in our ATC tab, our new
flowgate impact calculator and more.

Take Care,

Bill Townsend
President
FriedWire Inc.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Group
On Wednesday, December 6th, The Weather Channel aired an episode of their=
=20
show "Atmospheres," which included a fifteen minute segment focusing on=20
Enron's Weather Risk Management business.  Mark Tawney, Steven Vu, Gary=20

The Weather Risk Management group completed the first ever Power Demand=20
transaction this week.  The transaction was a swap based on the PJM demand=

      ON A POSITIVE NOTE:
      On a positive note I've learned that no matter what happens,
or how bad
      it
      seems today,
      life does go on, and it will be better  tomorrow.  I've
learned that you
      can
      tell a
      lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three
things: a rainy

      day, lost
      luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned
that regardless
      of
      your
            relationship with your parents, you'll miss
them when they're gone from your life.
            I've learned that making a "living" is not
the same thing as making a "life."
            I've learned that life sometimes gives you a
second chance. I've learned
      that you
      shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both
hands. You need
      to
      be able to
            throw something back.  I've learned that if
you pursue happiness, it will elude you.
            But if you focus on your family, your
friends, the needs of others, your
      work and doing
      the very best you can, happiness will find you. I've learned
that
      whenever I
      decide
      something with an open heart, I usually make the right
decision. I've
      learned that even
      when I have pains, I don't have to be one.  I've learned
that every day
      you
      should
      reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch,
holding
      hands, a
      warm hug,
            or just a friendly pat on the back. I've
learned that I still have a lot to learn.
      I've learned that you should pass this on to someone you
care about. I
      just
      did. Sometimes
      they just need a little something to make them smile.


            Note: people will forget what you said,
people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made
them feel.

	Some of the best Websites are created by The People Who Have Too Much Free 
Time - and if someone recreating over 180 scenes from the Star Wars Trilogy 
entirely out of Lego blocks isn't a sign of someone who's got too much free 
time, then I don't know what is. That's right, a scary individual who most 
likely lives in a basement somewhere has spent a jaw-dropping 2,600 hours 
recreating Star Wars in Lego format and has put it all on a Web site for the 
geek in all of us to check out. Warped and strange? Probably. Creative and 
interesting? Definitely. http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf

	Chai is the word for tea in many parts of the world. India's take on chai is 
gaining popularity in the U.S. and has found a home on the menu at Starbucks 
and other coffee houses. It is a spiced milk tea containing rich black tea, 
heavy milk, a combination of various spices and a sweetener. The spices used 
can vary but are usually cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper. For

	Phone Phun
	There was this phone company that was going hire one of two teams of 
telephone pole installers and it was up to the boss to choose. 
	
	So the boss said to both teams, "Here's what we'll do. Each team will be 
installing poles out on the new road. The team that installs the most poles 
gets the job." Both teams headed right out. At end of shift, one team came 
back and the boss asked them how many they had installed and they said  
they'd put 12 in. Forty-five minutes later, the other team came back in and 
they were dragging. The boss said, "Well, how many poles did you guys 
install?" The team leader wiped his brow and sighed, "We got three in." 
	
	The boss gasped, "Three? Those other guys put 12 in!" 
	
	"Yeah," said the leader, "But you should see how much they left sticking 
out!"

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=
ce=20
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=
=20
Team members are:=20

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=
ors=20
about the new process. =20

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are=20
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01=
,s=20
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized=

? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies=20

Key Benefits

Beth Perlman, previously in charge of application development in Europe, has 
returned to Houston  to head up ENA's application development, as well as RAC 
and Treasury applications. Beth will report directly to Philippe Bibi.  In 
order to capitalize on the enhanced global approach that we have taken, Mark 
Pickering and Beth will have joint responsibility for the development groups 
that cross regional lines, including global products trading, power trading, 
and other common operations applications.

Dan Bruce, previously in charge of RAC and Treasury applications, has assumed 
responsibility for IT support in the International regions as well as EE&CC 
and Asset Operations.

Please join me in congratulating Beth & Dan on their new positions.

Brenna,
         This probably isn't the best time to be mentioning this, and I don't 
want you to think there is any motive behind it because reviews are currently 
in process, but I wanted to briefly talk to you about Judy Hernandez:

I think she puts in a great work performance for many reasons:

1) She is ALWAYS willing to help out when someone is backed up on projects.
2) If you ask her to help you out with something, it's completed within the 
same day or early the next day.
3) She is NEVER in a bad mood, and if she is she certainly doesn't let you 
know about it nor take out her frustrations on anyone.
4) She is very knowledgeable when it comes to questions about deals being 
acceptable or not.
5) If she can't answer your question she points you in the right direction 
for it to be answered. 

I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate working with her.  
Thanks-Eve

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

What actions do you display at work?

I drive into work listening to gospel music or a pre-recorded  sermon on th=
e=20
radio. I get out of the car and walk to the building
entrance. As I open the building door I leave just enough room for me to ge=
t=20
in and I leave Jesus standing outside as the door closes behind me. He's=20
standing with His palms on the door glass and watches me as I get on the=20
elevator.  His eyes are sad and He turns and goes to sit on the stone bench=
.=20
There He sits patiently
and waits for me for the next 9 hours. First two hours of work - I fuss and=
=20
complain about things not going right.  Jesus, sitting
with his chin in His hand looks upward toward the building wishing He could=
=20
help me. By lunchtime - I'm flustered, regretting I work in this place and=
=20
sputtering bitterness all over folks. Jesus comes around to the side of the=
=20
building where my cubicle is located. He looks up from the ground trying to=
=20
get my attention but I can't hear him; my focus is on my problems. Jesus go=
es=20
back to the front of the building, sits down and continues to wait for me. =
He=20
thinks to
Himself as He looks up to the third floor, "They went in there defenseless.=
 =20
If only they had taken me in there with them.  When will they learn?" End o=
f=20
the day - I'm pooped, run down, no energy, irritable & frustrated.  I leave=
=20
the building & Jesus gets up happily to greet me but I'm in no mood for Him=
=20
now.  I've just been to hell and back and the last thing I want to do is be=
=20
bothered with anyone.

God just actually showed me this is how I'VE been acting.  He showed me eac=
h=20
act and worst of all, He let me feel a small
portion of how grieved he was because of my actions and
attitude.  I left Jesus standing outside, almost let the door smack him in=
=20
His face.  From time to time our jobs overwhelm us and we completely forget=
=20
to  "take Jesus with us".  We may not go around cursing anyone out or=20
punching anyone in the face (hopefully not) but what are our actions saying=
=20
about us and about whom or whose we are?

We are the salt of the Earth and the light of the world. A city on a hill=
=20
cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. =
=20
Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the=20
house. Matt. 5:13-15. We should be bringing
peace to our jobs and not be the cause of confusion.  We should be the ones=
=20
to bring our gifts & talents to the table to help in
WHATEVER area God has chosen for us to work in.  Col.3:23-24 "Whatever you=
=20
do, work at it with ALL your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, =
=20
since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a=20
reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to 
obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying 
costs.  Requests to the Department should be addressed to:  Public Disclosure 
Room, N-5638, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

Joke of the Day

 Steve's a Jerk


Once upon a time there was a woman married to an annoying man named Steve. =
He=20
would complain about everything. That day he went to their creek with his=
=20
mule. He complained so much that the mule got annoyed and kicked him to=20
death. =20

At the funeral, when all the men walked by the wife she shook her head yes=
=20
and every time the women walked by she shook her head no. =20

The minister asked "Why are you shaking your head 'yes' for men and 'no' fo=
r=20
women?" =20

Her response was, "The men would say how sorry they felt for me and I was=
=20
saying, 'Yes, I'll be alright.' When the women walked by, they were asking =
if=20
the mule is for sale...." =20

=09=09The Onion =20
=09=09
=09=09Quick! What's the funniest site on the Web? If you said The Onion, "A=
merica's=20
Finest News Source," consider your sense of humor validated. This online=20
newspaper is the best social satire going -- no small feat in this=20
postmodern, post-satire age. Ostensibly another news site, The Onion offers=
 a=20
twisted view of current events and the typical fodder of local newspapers.=
=20
The current issue has election news -- "Vote, Voter Wasted" -- and human=20
interest -- "Neighborhood Children Gear Up for Hotly Anticipated 'Opening o=
f=20
the Gerbil's Tomb.'" The site uses friends and relations of the editors for=
=20
pictures. Good sports because usually they're posing as the incredible dwee=
bs=20
and losers populating the typical Onion news story. Be warned -- The Onion =
is=20
too funny to resist. You'll be mailing stories to friends and wasting the=
=20
boss's time if you're not careful. By the way, the Onion bills itself as "n=
ot=20
intended for readers under 18 years of age." I might ! recommend that the=
=20
easily offended or politically rigid avoid it, for the sake of cardiovascul=
ar=20
health.
=09=09

SERC

Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid 
untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, 
DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only 
reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80


FRCC

Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the 
Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 
40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, 
there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait 
until mid morning to look for preschedules.  
  
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 90  OFFER $ 150

Subject: Kathleen & Charity Going Home
Message-ID: <20001022.165815.-3933263.0.gvlincoln@juno.com>

Dear Friends,

Praise God the girls are going home!  We're scheduled to leave the
hospital tomorrow around 12:00pm.  It's been a long haul but the Lord has
brought us through, one day at a time.

We give God thanks for all of your prayers.  It's been a remarkable
experience to see the outpouring of concern and love from all of you.
God has heard your prayers!  Thanks!

The girls are really doing well (obviously).  Both girls will go home
with feeding tubes and the hope is to get Charity off it within a matter
of weeks while the doctors expect Kathleen to take a little longer.  But
we know God can change that and make the time much shorter.  Please
remember this in your prayers.

I will try to update the web page with updates on the progress of the
girls and current prayer requests in the days ahead.

Thanks again and may the God of restoration (Acts 3:21) bless you.

Greg

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

You will need special permission to access the files located in 
M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

Subject: Could it be we're not paying attention?



The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

Hi everyone.  Hope you all llike this one.  It's sweet.

Love ya'll

Coco

Sally was only eight years old when she heard Mommy and Daddy talking about
her little brother, Georgi. He was very sick and they had done everything
they could afford to save his life. Only a very expensive surgery could help
him now and that was out of the financial question. She heard Daddy say it
with a whispered desperation, "Only a miracle can save him now."

Sally went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding
place in the closet. She shook all the change out on the floor and
counted it carefully. Three times. The total had to be exactly
perfect. No chance here for mistakes. Tying the coins up in a kerchief, she
slipped out of the apartment and made her way to the corner drug store.

She waited patiently for the pharmacist to give her attention but he was too
busy talking to another man to be bothered by an eight year old.Sally
twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. She cleared her throat. No
good.Finally she took a quarter from its hiding place and banged it on the
glass counter. That did it!

"And what do you want?" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.
"I'm talking to my brother."

"Well, I want to talk to you about my brother," Sally answered back in the
same annoyed tone. "He's sick ... and I want to buy a miracle." "I beg your
pardon," said the pharmacist. "My Daddy says only a miracle  can save him
now. So how much does a miracle cost?"

"We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I can't help you."

"Listen, I have the money to pay for it. Just tell me how much it
costs."

The well dressed man stooped down and asked, "What kind of a miracle does
your brother need?" "I don't know," Sally answered. A tear  started down her
cheek. "I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.
But my folks can't pay for it, so I have my money.

"How much do you have?" asked the well dressed man. "A dollar and eleven
cents," Sally answered proudly. "And it's all the money I have in the
world."

"Well, what a coincidence," smiled the man. "A dollar and eleven cents--the
exact price of a miracle to save a little brother. "He took her money in one
hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten and said "Take me to
where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents."

That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, renowned surgeon,
specializing in solving Georgi's malady. The operation was completed without
charge and it wasn't long until Georgi was home again and doing well. Mommy
and Daddy were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them
to this place. "That surgery," Mommy whispered. "It's like a miracle. I
wonder how much it would have cost?"

Sally smiled to herself. She knew exactly how much a miracle
cost...one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child.

You guys don't have to send this back to me because I know some of you don't 
have time, but I know you will ask the Lord to bless me anyway.  I am sending 
this to you because I think it is a nice prayer.  Let's keep each other in 
our prayers.

Love ya,

?? MORNING BLESSING
    I asked the Lord to bless you,
    As I prayed for you today.
??  To guide you and protect you,
    As you go along your way.
    His love is always with you,
    His promises are true,
    And when we give Him all our cares,
 ?? We know He'll see us through.
    So when the road you're traveling on
  ? Seems difficult at best,
    Just remember I'm here praying
    And God will do the rest.



 Forward this to at least 10 people whom you want God to bless and,
 don't forget to send it back to the one who asked God to bless you
 first.

Hello all

Some of Enron Confirmation Letters are able to fit on one page, example: Duke 
Energy Marketing and Trading LLC are often able to fit on one page (not all 
the time).  In the past Duke one page Confirmation Letters we coming over 
with a number 1 on the bottom, but both signatures (Enron and Counterparty) 
were included.  We have taken the page number out of the template and 
hopefully all is corrected.  If you see an Enron Confirmation Letter with 
both signatures included although it might have a Page 1 on the bottom, and 
no other changes, it is okay to Execute the Confirmation Letter.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know!

Thanks 
Stephanie

FW:? A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza
?
I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

Country Doctor

An old country doctor went deep into the woods to  deliver a
baby. The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity.
Upon  arriving, the doctor realized that the laboring mother
and her five-year-old  child were the only people there.
With no one else to help him, the doctor  finally instructed
the child to hold a lantern so he could see to deliver  the
baby.
The child was happy to help, and held the lantern high
while  the mother pushed. After a little while, the baby was
born, and the doctor  held the newborn by the feet and
spanked him on the bottom to get him to take  his first
breath.
With the excitement over, the doctor asked  the
five-year-old for an opinion about the baby.

"Hit him again," the  five-year-old said. "He shouldn't have
crawled up there in the first  place!"

I have a praise report to share.  
 I was touched as was everyone else who read the prayer request for Kat.   I 
delivered my donation to Darlene by hand  because she is on the floor below 
me.  I believe the Lord gave me an amount to give and I was obedient (my mind 
was saying you shouldn't!  You will need this money yourself!)   I believe 
because I was obedient the Lord has blessed me.   Luke 6:38 " Give and it 
shall be given good measure , pressed down, shaken together and running over 
shall men give unto your bosom.  For with the same measure you mete it shall 
be measured again unto you."    I believe that the new testament church 
operated the way we Christians are supposed to.    Helping each other and 
manifesting the love of God.
To make a long story kinda short.   The Lord use a seemingly awful situation 
to  work out for good.  My son missed his airplane back to school.  We spent 
the whole day Sunday in the airport on standby trying to get a flight on 
overbooked airplanes.   He ended up having to wait for a flight this Monday 
to get back to school on time.  It was urgent that he be back before 3:00 
today.   I paid additional money to book him on a flight that had an 
available seat leaving a t 10:00 am this morning. The flight  would arrive 
too late but was the only thing we could obtain.     One of the agents was 
led of the Lord, I believe,  to help us and told us to get to the airport at 
5: 00 this morning and get  on the stand-by list for the 6:00am  flight which 
was also overbooked,  and maybe my son had a chance of getting on.   We did 
as she said and sure enough he was able to get on board and get to his 
destination at 12:45 today. (My son said to me "Mom lets pray that I will be 
able to get on this flight" as we passed through security to get to the 
boarding gate).     Praise the LORD!   The gate person gave him a real ticket 
for a real seat when he gave his name at the gate.  The story does not end 
there.   Another flight person taking the luggage remembered us from the 
previous day , found that we had been bumped the day before even though my 
son had been number 1 in line to get a seat on the next flight out .  This 
woman gave us back the money I had to pay for rescheduling the flight , PLUS 
A FREE ROUND TRIP TICKET TO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO! 
 PRESSED DOWN SHAKEN TOGETHER AND RUNNING OVER!!!!   IT IS TRULY MORE BLESSED 
TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE.  We can't out give God!  
Blessings,
Juanita

Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=

for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Reason, Season and Lifetime


People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.
When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.
When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to
meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.
They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you
with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or
spiritually.
They may seem like a godsend, and they are.
They are there for the reason you need them to be.
Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this
person willsay or do something to bring the relationship to an end.
Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.
Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.
What we must realize is that our need has been  met, our desire fulfilled;
their work is done.
The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.

When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because
 your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.
They may bring you an experience of  peace or make you laugh.
They may teach you something you have never done.
They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it!
It is real!  But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things
you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.
Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put
what  you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your
life.
It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

Thank you for being a part of my life... Smile and stop here if you're not
into this final part: This is to show people you love them and to see how
many people love you!!
Don't feel embarrassed cause only you will get the results. Send it to every
friend
that you have online, including the person who sent it to you.

0 Replies = you may need to work on your people skills
2 Replies = you are nice but probably need to be more outgoing.
4 Replies = you have picked your friends well
6 Replies = you are downright popular
8 Replies or More = you are totally awesome (and probably know why you're on
MY list)!

When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do. There is nothing attached. This is the power of
prayer
at work. Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth
day.
Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be
content
knowing that you are a child of God. Let His presence settle into your
bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the
sun.
It is there for each and every one of you.

Send this to (4) or more people and witness the awesome power
of prayer.

God Bless.

Here is a copy of section from previous document..................
        reminder ...............most of us will not enter any hours on Dec. 
25th or 26th.

Please READ: (original was sent to us prior to July 4th)

Resolution, Instructions or Action Plan:

For eligible employees, SAP has July 3rd and 4th (and all Enron recognized 
holidays) built into the work schedules.

1) Full-time exempt / non-exempt employees will not have to enter HOL for 
July 3rd-4th, in most cases.

 Exceptions:  9-8-1's with Monday, July 3rd is a "scheduled" off day.  
                                 4x10 (Tuesday-Friday), July 3rd is a 
"scheduled" off day.
 These employees are eligible for a holiday (HOL) on another day (floating 
holiday per management discretion).
 Use HOL absence and attendance type when recording this time.

2) Part-time employees, including reduced hours employees, can code July 3rd 
and 4th as either HNP (Holiday No 
Pay), REG (if worked) or POD (Paid Off Duty)

3) What if I work the holiday? 
     Working the holiday is the same as working on a day off.  Code "REG" and 
the number of hours worked on that day. 
      In regards to additional compensation, please refer to the policies and 
procedures document on the HR Web Site.
    
 Contractors and temporary employees are not eligible for Holiday Compensation

For more information contact:  Jarrod Haughn (x57468)

Help each other out where you can and remember you can call 5-4SAP for help.

The blonde's boyfriend figures that he's pretty good at puzzles, so he heads

puzzle spread all over the table. He studies the pieces for a moment, then he 
studies the box.

>  grow up and fulfill all his dreams. Now that was no

>  your life?" "Mommy, I always wanted to be a fireman
>  when I grew up." Mom smiled back and said, "Let's see
>  if we can make your wish come true".
>
>  Later in Phoenix, Arizona, where she met Fireman Bob,
>  who had a heart as big as Phoenix. She explained her
>  son's final wish and asked if it might be possible to
>  her six-year-old son a ride around the block on a fire
>  engine. Fireman Bob said, "Look, we can do better than
>  that. If you'll have your son ready at seven o'clock
>  Wednesday morning, we'll make him an honorary fireman
>  for the whole day. He can come down to the fire station,
>  eat with us, go out on all the fire calls, the whole
>  nine yards! "And if you'll give us his sizes, we'll
>  get a real fire uniform for him, with a real fire hat
>  - not a toy one - with the emblem of the Phoenix Fire
>  Department on it, a yellow slicker like we wear and
>  rubber boots. They're all manufactured right here in
>  Phoenix, so we can get them fast."
>
>  Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Billy, dressed
>  him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his
>  hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck.
>  Billy got to sit on the back of the truck and help
>  steer it back to the fire station. He was in heaven.
>  There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and
>  Billy got to go out on all three calls. He rode in
>  the different fire engines, the paramedic's van and
>  even the fire chief's car. He was also video taped
>  for the local news program. Having his dream come
>  true, with all the love and attention that was
>  lavished upon him, so deeply touched Billy that he
>  lived three months longer than any doctor thought
>  possible.
>
>  One night all of his vital signs began to drop
>  dramatically and the head nurse, who believed in the
>  hospice concept that no one should die alone, began
>  to call the family members to the hospital. Then she
>  remembered the day Billy had spent as a fireman,
>  so she called the fire chief and asked if it would
>  be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the
>  hospital to be with Billy as he made his transition.
>  The chief replied, "We can do better than that.
>  We'll be there in five minutes. Will you please do
>  me a favor? When you hear the sirens screaming and
>  see the lights flashing, will you announce over the
>  PA system that there is not a fire?" It's just the
>  fire department coming to see one of it's finest
>  members one more time. And will you open the window
>  to his room?......Thanks."
>
>  About five minutes later a hook and ladder truck
>  arrived at the hospital, extended its ladder up to

Barney Can't Compete
In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune (1/17/98) Judy Zmerold writes:

Three-year-old Katie was taken to her pediatrician during a recent
bout with the flu. As the doctor examined her ears, he asked, "Will I find Big
Bird in here?"

Apprehensively, Katie replied, "No."

Then, before examining her throat, he asked, "Will I find the Cookie
Monster in here?"

Again, "No."

Finally, listening to her heart, he asked, "Will I find Barney in here?"

With innocent conviction, she looked him directly in the eye and
said, "No, Jesus is in my heart. Barney is on my underwear."

Subject: FW: You will get a very pleasant surprise.

This is a very nice story.  You never know when Jesus will visit you so 
always be willing to give.  I don't consider this to be a chain letter, I 
just like the story and I thought you would too.


Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter.  She picked it
up and looked at it before opening, but then  she looked at the envelope
again. There was no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address.  She
read the letter:

Dear Ruth:

I'm going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I would like
to visit.

Love Always,
Jesus

Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table.   "Why
would the Lord want to visit me?   I'm nobody special.  I don't have
anything to offer."   With that thought,  Ruth remembered her empty
kitchen cabinets. "Oh my  goodness,  I really don't have anything to
offer.  I'll have to run down  to the store and buy something for
dinner."  She reached for her purse and counted out it's contents.
Five dollars and forty cents. "Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts,
at least."   She threw on her coat and hurried out the door. A loaf of
french bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of
milk...leaving Ruth with grand total of twelve cents to last her until
Monday.   Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager
offerings tucked under her arm."Hey lady, can you help us, lady?"  Ruth
had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two
figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed
in little more than rags.   "Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and
my wife and I have been living  out here  on the street, and, well, now
it's getting cold and  we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you
could help us, lady, we'd really appreciate it." Ruth looked at them
both.  They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain
that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to.  "Sir,
I'd like to help  you, but I'm a poor woman myself.  All I have is a few
cold cuts  and  some  bread, and I'm having an important guest for
dinner  tonight  and  I was planning on serving that to Him." "Yeah,
well, okay lady, I understand.  Thanks anyway."  The man put his arm
around the woman's shoulders,  turned and  he headed back into the
alley.  As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her
heart.  "Sir, wait!"   The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the
alley after them.  "Look, why don't you take this food.  I'll figure out
something  else to serve my  guest."  She handed the man her grocery bag
"Thank you lady. Thank you very much!"  "Yes, thank you!" It was the
man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she  was shivering. "You know,
I've got another coat at home.  Here, why don't you take this one."
Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders.
Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her
coat and with nothing to serve her guest.

"Thank you lady! Thank you very much!"

Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried
too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer
Him.  She fumbled through her purse for the door key.   But as she did,
she noticed another envelope in her mailbox.  "That's odd.  The mailman
doesn't usually come twice in one day."   She took the envelope out of
the box and opened it.

Dear Ruth:

It was so good to see you again.  Thank you for  the lovely meal. And
thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.

Love Always,
Jesus

The air was still cold, but even without her coat, Ruth no  longer
noticed.

If you love Jesus, send this to ten people.   Do not keep this message.

The mantra must leave your hands within 96  hours. You will get a very
pleasant surprise.

Falling in love.
Laughing so hard your face hurts.
Hot shower.
No lines at the Super Walmart.
A special glance.
Getting mail.
Taking a drive on a scenic road.
Hearing your favorite song on the radio.
Lying in bed listening to the rain outside.
Hot towels out of the dryer.
Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price.
Chocolate milkshake.
A long distance phone call.
A bubble bath.
Giggling.
A good conversation.
The beach.
Finding a $20 bill in your coat from last winter.
Laughing at yourself.
Midnight phone calls that last for hours.
Running through sprinklers.
Laughing for absolutely no reason at all.
Having someone tell you that you're beautiful.
Laughing at an inside joke.
Friends.
Falling in love for the first time.
Accidentally overhearing someone say something nice about you.
Waking up and realizing you still have a few hours left to sleep.
Your first kiss.
Making new friends or spending time with old ones.
Playing with a puppy.
Late night talks with your roommate
Having someone play with your hair.
Sweet dreams.
Hot chocolate.
Road trips with friends.
Swinging on swings.
Watching a good movie cuddled up on a couch with someone you love.
Wrapping presents under the Christmas tree while eating cookies and drinking  
eggnog.
Song lyrics printed inside your new CD so you can sing along without feeling 
stupid.
Going to a really good concert.
Making eye contact with a cute stranger.
Making chocolate chip cookies!
Hugging the person you love.
Watching the expression someone's face as they open a much-desired present 
from you.
Watching the sunrise.
Getting out of bed every morning and thanking God for another beautiful day.

PASS ON THESE NATURAL HIGHS TO AT LEAST 7 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR AND 
GOOD-LUCK WILL COME TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS!!

Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true riends
will leave a footprint in your heart.

 >"Deep inside the heart of every man there lies a deep, yawning chasm which 
can only be filled by the one true God."

Subject: SPS Grandfathered agreement on Blackwater tie.


This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

HI,  we will postpone the meeting for today.  I do not have the list ready 
for Joe, and we are all so busy.  I feel it would be better to do the meeting 
again after the first of the year.  

Thanks,
Brenna

Maybe we've seen this one before, but if we didn't and even if we did, let's 
keep ourselves reminded about this true fact and try to do something about it 
(at least pray about it).  Take care.

The Biggest Mathematical Miracle in the World!

Moses and his people were in the desert, but
what was he going to do with them?
They had to be fed, and fed is what he did,
according to the Quartermaster General in the
Army.  It is reported that Moses would have to have
had 1500 tons of food each day.

Do you know that to bring that much food each
day, two freight trains, each a mile long,  would be required!
Besides you must remember, they were out in the desert, so they
would have to have firewood to use in cooking the food.
This would take 4000 tons of wood and a few
more  freight trains, each a mile long,  just for one day.

And just think, they were forty years in transit.
And oh yes! They would have to have water. If they
only had enough to drink and wash a few dishes,
it would take 11,000,000 gallons each day, and a
freight train with tank cars, 1800 miles long, just to bring water!

And then another thing! They had to get across
the Red Sea at night. (They did?) Now, if they went on
a narrow path, double file, the line would be 800
miles long and would require 35 days and  nights
to get through. So, there had to be a space in the Red Sea,
3 miles  wide so that they could walk 5000 abreast to get
over in one night.

But then, there is another problem. Each time
they camped at the end of  the day, a campground
two-thirds the size of the state of Rhode Island was
required, or a total of 750 square miles
long...think of  it! This space just for nightly camping.

Do you think Moses figured all this out
before he left Egypt?

I think not!

You see, Moses believed in God.

God took care of these things for him.

Now do you think God has any problem taking
care of all your needs?
I ASKED THE LORD TO BLESS YOU.......
I asked the Lord to bless you As I prayed for you today,
To guide you and protect you As you go along your way....
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.
So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best,
Just remember I'm here praying
And God will do the rest.

Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless, don't
forget to send it back to the one who asked
God to bless you first.
A POSITIVE  ATTITUDE CAUSES A CHAIN REACTION OF
POSITIVE THOUGHTS, EVENTS  AND OUTCOMES!!

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
              -Philippians 4:13

Good morning my friends.  I probably sent this to some of you before, but I 
ran into it again, and made me feel so good, that I felt like sharing it with 
all of you again.  Hope you can open it and enjoy it, as much as I did.

Love you all.

Subject: Your Friend

Darlene,
I have a friend in my Sunday School class who is the Josten's distributor 
here in Dallas. This is the company that makes class rings. He will sell me a 
class ring at cost! (How 'bout that?) So, if you will get the info from your 
friend about her daughter (ring size, school, name, etc) I will get her a 
ring. I don't know that I can afford gold, but I can silver, if that is ok. 
If we want gold, we could maybe pool some money. The cost of a gold ring is 
$175 vs $75 for silver. Anyway, just let me know as soon as you can so that I 
can get it ordered. I'm not sure on the delivery time, but we do need to get 
moving on it so that she can enjoy it before the school year is over.
 
Blessings!
Kent

	It's Thanksgiving. Put down the turkey. Stop watching football. And learn a 
little about the holiday you're celebrating today at Plimoth.org. If the 
Library section is causing you to read too much, then swing on over to the 
Plantation section and just scroll through some cool pictures. Done? Good - 
you're just in time for some pumpkin pie. www.plimoth.org

	At one time, the turkey and the bald eagle were both considered America's 
national symbol. Benjamin Franklin was pro turkey, and felt it was a better 
choice than the bald eagle, which he felt was "a coward." For more, click

return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.

something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........

THE EMPTY CHAIR 

 ?A man's daughter  had asked the local minister to come and pray 
  with her father.  When the minister arrived, he found the man lying 
  in bed with his head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair 
  sat beside his bed.  The minister assumed that the old fellow had 
  been informed of his visit. "I ?guess you were expecting me,"  he said. 
 ? 
 ?"No, who are you?"  said the father. 
 ? 
 ?The minister told him his name and then remarked, "I see the empty 
  chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up." 
 ? 
 ?"Oh yeah, the chair,"  said the bedridden man. "Would you mind closing 
  the door?"  Puzzled, the minister ?shut the door. "I have never told anyone 
  this, not even my daughter," said the man. "But all of  my life I have 
 ?never ?known how to pray.   At church I used  to hear the pastor 
 ?talk about prayer, but it went right over my  head.  I abandoned 
 ?any attempt at prayer," the old man continued, "until one day about 
 ?four years ago my best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just 
 ?a simple matter of having a  conversation with Jesus.  Here is what 
 ?I suggest.  "Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of 
 ?you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.   It's not spooky because he 
 ?promised, "I'll  be with you always." Then just speak to him in the 
 ?same way  you're doing with me right now.' "So, I tried it and I've liked it
 ?so much that I do it a couple of hours every day.  I'm careful though. 
 ?If my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either 
 ?have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm." 
 ? 
 ?The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the 
  old man to continue on the  journey.  ?Then he prayed with him, 
  anointed him with oil, and  returned to the church. Two nights later 
  the daughter called to  tell the minister  that her daddy had died 
  that afternoon. 

  "Did  he die in peace?" he asked. 
 
 ?"Yes, when I  left the house about two o' clock, he called me over to 
  his  bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.   
  When I  got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. 
  "But there was something strange about his death. Apparently, 
  just  before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on 
  the chair beside the bed. What do you make of ?that?" 
  ? 
 ?The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said,  "I wish we could all go 
like that." 
 ? 
 ?Just ?send this to  four people and do not break this, please. Prayer is 
  one of the  best free gifts we receive. There is no cost but a lot of  
rewards. 
 ? 
 ?"I never said it would be easy,  I only said it would be worth it"

Pass this on to anyone you care about....if you get it back you
have found your true friends.

A ball is a circle, No beginning, No end.  It keeps us together,

the treasure of friendship you've granted to me.

Today I pass the friendship ball to you.  Pass it on to someone
who is a friend to you.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

PRAYER WHEEL

When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to
you.... That's all you have to do....There is nothing attached....This
is powerful.... Just send this to four people and watch God answer
prayer to work in your life.

Do not break this, please.... Prayer is one of the best free gifts we
receive.... There is no cost but a lot of rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another. Thanks for praying.

Subject: Fwd: Prayer Request

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

=09=09For More Information ...  =20
=09=09
=09=09For years now, public TV and other education-oriented broadcasters, l=
ike the=20
History Channel and Discovery Channel, have given their viewers Web address=
es=20
where they can go to get more information on the program's topic. This is a=
=20
great idea, and not just because it'll help you get your homework done. If=
=20
you're inclined to watch "educational" TV in the first place, you probably=
=20
need no coaching to pursue topics you find interesting. These sites are gre=
at=20
places to start. They often list links and other resources. They're also=20
great for the morning after, when you're discussing what you watched last=
=20
night with your friends and co-workers. If you can't remember a certain=20
thing, or if anything is in dispute, a quick click or two will take care of=
=20
things. After all, the Internet is the ultimate argument-solver.

Subject: Be Careful!


I don't know if this is on the up and up, but its better to be aware.



>
 Please be extremely careful when you leave work and if at all
possible, do not leave alone when it gets late. A woman leaving work was
kidnapped yesterday at 6:30 from Lamar between the El Paso Bldg. and
Dynegy.  They drugged her but it appears that there was no rape.... the
police told her that about a month ago another girl downtown was also
kidnapped and raped ... so, please be careful!!!!!!!!

Please pass this on to your friends who work downtown.

> Last week I took my children to a restaurant. My six-year-old son asked if
> he  could say grace.  As we bowed our heads he said, "God is good. God  is
> great.  Thank you for the food, and I would even thank you more if Mom
> gets us ice  cream for dessert. And Liberty and justice for all! Amen!"
>
> Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman
> remark, "That's what's wrong with this country. Kids today don't even know
> how to pray. Asking God for ice-cream!  Why, I never!"
>
> Hearing this, my son burst into tears and asked me, "Did I do it wrong? Is
> God mad at me?"
>
> As I held him and assured him that he had done a terrific job and God was
> certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table.  He
> winked at my son and said, "I happen to know that God thought that was a
> great prayer."
>
> "Really?" my son asked.
>
> "Cross my heart."  Then in theatrical whisper, he added (indicating the
> woman whose remark had started this whole thing), "Too bad  she never asks
> God for ice cream.  A little ice cream is good for the soul sometimes."
>
> Naturally, I bought my kid's ice cream at the end of the meal. My son
> stared  at it for a moment and then did something I will remember the rest
> of my  life.  He picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and
> placed it  in front of the woman.  With a big smile he told her,  "Here,
> this is for you.  Ice cream is good for the soul sometimes and my soul is
> good already."
>
> The End
>
> I loved the story, and I hope you like it too.
>
> Please keep it moving.

> God Bless.

> >>
> >>    In my job, I review criminal and psychiatric files of
> >>    imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their
> >>    release date.  I decide if they are likely to re-offend
> >>    based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them
> >>    to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that

> >>

> >>    at fault for being raped or attacked, but there are
> >>    definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim.
> >>
> >>    Here are the most common mistakes women make that
> >>    could result in them getting kidnapped, attacked,
> >>    and/or raped:
> >>
> >>    1.  Getting into the attacker's car when he pulls a
> >>    gun and orders you to get into his vehicle.
> >>
> >>    Most attackers don't want to shoot you ... they want
> >>    you to get into the car so that they can drive you to

> >>    screaming.  It is MUCH more likely than not that he
> >>    will just move on to an easier target.
> >>
> >>    2.  Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you
> >>    pointing at your car pretending something is wrong.
> >>
> >>    If this happens, drive to the nearest well-lit and
> >>    populated gas station and look the car over yourself
> >>    (or ask an attendant).  Never pull over.  Believe it
> >>    or not, many women have fallen for this for fear of
> >>    their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the
> >>    road.  Not likely.
> >>
> >>    3.  Not locking your doors while driving.
> >>
> >>    I have read several cases where the attacker simply
> >>    walks up to a woman's car while she's at a traffic
> >>    light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn.
> >>
> >>    4.  Opening your front door when you have not
> >>    positively identified who is there.
> >>
> >>    If you don't have a peep hole, get one.  I've seen
> >>    countless cases where the attacker gains access to his
> >>    victims simply by knocking on their door.
> >>
> >>    Don't let an attacker get into your home.  He then has
> >>    a private, relatively soundproof place to attack you.
> >>
> >>    5.  Not being alert in parking lots.
> >>
> >>    If you go to the grocery store at night, don't be shy
> >>    about asking for an escort to your car.  Too many
> >>    women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in
> >>    the parking lot.
> >>
> >>    Look in your back seat before entering your car.  Cars
> >>    provide endless hiding places for attackers, both
> >>    inside them and in between them.
> >>
> >>    Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left
> >>    and right and behind you with your head up all the
> >>    time.  You may appear paranoid and look funny to
> >>    others, but an attacker will think twice about
> >>    approaching someone who appears so aware of what's
> >>    going on.
> >>
> >>    6.  Trusting a clean cut, honest looking stranger.
> >>
> >>    I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of
> >>    Florida.  They do not look like monsters.  They often
> >>    look like they could be your friendly grocer, bank
> >>    teller, waiter, neighbor, clergy, doctor, etc.  They
> >>    are every age between 15 and 90, and probably beyond.

> >> 7.  Trusting people to be alone with your children.
> >>
> >> This is a difficult one, because child molesters end

> >> the molester.
> >>
> >> Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the

               From: THE BOSS
            Subject: YOURSELF
          Reference: LIFE


I am God.
Today I will be handling all of your problems.
Please remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not
attempt to resolve it.  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do)
box.
It will be addressed in My time, not yours.  Once the matter is placed into
the box, do not hold on to it.
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; don't despair. There are people in
this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege.
Should you have a bad day at work;
Think of the man who has been out of work for years.
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has
never known what it's like to love and be loved in return.
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in dire
straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of
the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient
in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
asking what is my purpose?
Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the
opportunity.
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance,
smallness or insecurities;
Remember, things could be worse.
You could be them!!!!
Let it go so God can do His job.

Something to think about....

> >>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people
before meeting the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful
for that gift.
> >>
> >>When the door of happiness closes, another opens,
but often times we look so long at the closed door
that we don't see the one which has been opened for
us.
> >>
> >>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on
a porch and swing with,never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
ever had.
> >>
> >>It's true that we don't know what we've got until
we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what
we've been missing until it arrives.
> >>
> >>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance
that they'll love you back!  Don't expect love in
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
> >>
> >>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone, but
it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
> >>
> >>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.  Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.Go for someone who
makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make
a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your
heart smile.
> >>
> >>There are moments in life when you miss someone so
much that you just want to pick them from your dreams
and hug them for real!
> >>
> >>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to
go; be what you want to be,because you have only one
life and one chance to do all the things you want to
do.
> >>
> >>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
keep you human, enough hope to make you  happy.
> >>
> >>Always put yourself in others' shoes.  If you feel
that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person,
too.
> >>
> >>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything; they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.
> >>
> >>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt,
those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.
> >>
> >>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and
ends with a tear.

The brightest future will always be based on a
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you
let go of your past failures and heartaches.
> >>
> >>When you were born, you were crying and everyone
around you was smiling. Live your life so that when
you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.
> >>
> >>
> >>
> >>Please send this message to those people who mean
something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........

Cool Site of the Day

 


The New York Review of Books may be a bit too pretentious for some, but it's 
more than worth plodding through for its literary value. The magazine's got a 
long list of contributors who've all made a huge mark on the world of letters 
- Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote, to name a few. Another 
highlight is the caricatures gallery by the journal's artist, David Levine. 
And finally, for those looking to avoid online booksellers' "book 
suggestions" that are just thinly-veiled advertisements, you'll find a 
plethora of genuine recommendations here. Read on. www.nybooks.com

Fact of the Day

 


Poppycock comes from the Dutch pappekak, and it describes something that is 
nonsense or whose value is equivalent to its original meaning: soft dung. For

Joke of the Day

 Out of the Mouths of Babes


A first grade teacher collected well known proverbs. She gave each
child in her class the first half of a proverb and asked them to come 
up with the remainder of the proverb. Their insight may surprise you.

Better to be safe than....................Punch a 5th grader

It's always darkest before............... Daylight Savings

You can lead a horse to water but.........how?

Don't bite the hand that................. looks dirty

If you lie down with dogs, you'll.........stink in the morning

Happy the bride who.......................gets all the presents

Don't put off till tomorrow what..........you put on to go to bed

Children should be seen and not...........spanked or grounded

You get out of something what you.........see pictured on the box

And the favorite...

Better late than..........................pregnant

few buttons? Of course you do! Then check out the FaceGenerator, a cool new

ECAR
  
Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 



MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only 
bid for a preschedule in Main.

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00.  
SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the 
North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low 
teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or 
a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak.  
SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during 
the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.  

FRCC-   For Saturday we sold power to Florida in the morning but were cut due 
to TLR's starting HE11.  Bids in Florida got to as high as mid 60's.  FPL and 
FPC were the one's bidding in the mid 60's.  TLR's were not lifted until H/E 
1, for H/E 1 we sold FPL $22(100mw's) into JEA.  For Sunday FP&L and TALL 
were both on the BID @ $26-35 Hourly in the morning and  BOD @ $ 55-65.00.  
Sunday morning we began buying  power from CE  and selling it to FPL and 
TALL.  TLR's were called startng H/E 11.  Florida was bidding in the mid 40's 
for a 16-hour schedule for Monday.    Offpeak bids were in the mid teens for 
both Saturday and Sunday night.

ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the 
high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for 
he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to 
north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up 
being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will 
not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set 
to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they 
will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these 
hours.

Subject: Fwd: A Child's Question



Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born.   The child asked God, 
"They tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow, but I am so small and 
helpless, how will I be able to live there?"   God replied, "Among my many 
angels, the one I have chose for you will be waiting for you and take care of 
you."

The child further inquired, "Here in heaven all I have to do is sing and 
smile to be happy, what happens when I go to earth?"   God said, "Your angel 
will sing for you and smile for you every day. You will feel your angel's 
love and be very happy."

Again the child asked, "I don't know the language, how will I understand when 
people talk to me?"   God said, "Your angel will tell you the most beautiful 
and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care, teach you 
how to speak."

"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?"   God said, "Your 
angel will place your hands together and teach you how to pray."

"I've heard there are bad men on Earth, who will protect me?"  God said, 
"Your angel will defend you, and even risk its life for you."

"I will not see you anymore, and I will be sad."    God said "Your angel will 
talk to you about me and teach you the way to come back to me.  I will always 
be next to you."

At that moment there was much peace in heaven, but voices from Earth could be 
heard, and the child hurriedly asked, "God, it's time for me to leave now, 
will you please tell me my angel's name?"    God replied, "Her name is not 
important, you will simply call her Mom."

And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit," and God saw that it was
good.

And Satan said, "There goes the neighborhood."

And God said, "Let us make Man...

And so God created Man in his own image; male and female created
he them. And God looked upon Man and Woman and saw that they were lean
and fit.

And God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and
spinach, green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman
would live long and healthy lives.

And Satan said, "I know how I can get back in this game."

And Satan created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the
99-cent double cheeseburger.

And Satan said to Man, "You want fries with that?"

And Man said, "Supersize them." And Man gained 5 pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her
figure that man found so fair.

And Satan brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained 5 pounds.

And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad."

And Satan brought forth Ben and Jerry's. And Woman gained 10
pounds.

And God said, "I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables and olive
oil with which to cook them."

And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak so big it needed its
own platter.

And Man gained 10 pounds and his bad cholesterol went through the
roof.

And God brought forth running shoes and Man resolved to lose those
extra pounds.

And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would
not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man
gained another 20 pounds.

And God said, "You're running up the score, Devil."

And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat
and brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy
center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And he created sour cream
dip also.

And Man clutched his remote control and ate the potato chips swaddled
in cholesterol.

And Satan saw and said, "It is good." And Man went into cardiac
arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

And Satan created HMO's.

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA=01,s network services.

1. Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy=
.
a. Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3DAEP, SINK=3DMDEA, BID =
PRICE =3D=20
$0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2. Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy. =20
a. Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DLAGN, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3D(LAGN UNIT NAME), SIN=
K=3DMDEA,=20
BID PRICE =3D $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will b=
e=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXI=
A)=20
use POR=3DEES.=20

3. Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sep=
a=20
is not flowing and we can bring MGW=01,s in from the Tva border.
a. Ex.  We find 11 MGW=01,s  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DMDEA, SOURCE=3DLGE, SINK=3DMDEA, BID=
 PRICE =3D=20
$0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying=20
(displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarif=
y=20
this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered=
=20
F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must=

request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is=
=20
NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load=20

Eve,

For the referenced counterparty, it is ok to Executed deals with a stamped 
signature line of Jocelyn Watson.  Also, Cinergy will write a number of days 
next to our Effective and Termination Dates.  This is ok as long as they do 
not cross out anything on our Confirms or adjust any of our dates.

Thanks,
Joe

Conformed to His Image
Romans 8:29-30
Faith Thoughts for February 3
by Pastor Carl Stevens

The transformed believer enjoys tremendous freedom. II Corinthians 3:17b
says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." This liberty comes
as the Christian is freed from his natural disposition, with its inevitable
anxiety and loneliness, and is transformed into the image of his Lord. "But
we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord" (II Corinthians 3:18).
It is in this manner that the child of God is able to function in the Kingdom
of God. He is transformed by the image of Jesus Christ functioning and
operating in his human vessel, bringing every thought and imagination into
the obedience of Jesus Christ (2). As the believer presents his body as a
living sacrifice to the Lord, he will experience the good, acceptable, and
perfect will of God (3).

Rather than conforming to the world and its system, the believer is inwardly
changed and transformed to the image of Christ by the power of God (4).
Anxiety, cosmic loneliness, and its undefined consequences are dealt with and
resolved in the transformation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
(1) Romans 8:29-30 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren. (30) Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.
(2) 2 Corinthians 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.
(3) Romans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service. (2) And be not conformed to this world: but
be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
(4) Romans 8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren.

Hi, 
 in case you need to know.....
The Spring/Summer 1999 Hard Copy Enron Phone Books - may be the last paper 
phone book we'll ever have for Enron.     So, if some of the common numbers 
or unchanged information is helpful to you, please keep your book.

Per Facilities, there is a task force to see if the On-line book can be 
redesigned to better incorporate the international offices, as well as stay 
up with all the Enron changes.

FYI - Enron is currently having approximately 500 employee changes - per week.
Per Facilities, it is due to both the growth and the moves.

Thanks,
Sandy

Subject: More about ATSI


John,

At the ATC Panel meeting in South Bend, I provided some information about
FirstEnergy's new  transmission subsidiary, American Transmission Systems,
Inc. (ATSI).  I have some updated information.

ATSI went commercial today, September 1. ATSI is a wholly owned subsidiary
of FirstEnergy Corp. and owns and operates all of FirstEnergy's transmission
facilities at voltages of 69 kV and above. ATSI is the transmission provider
and performs the control area operator function for the FE control area. You
may want to visit ATSI's OASIS home page, which can be accessed the same way
as its predecessor FE OASIS home page. The organization charts, tariff,
provider information, etc., have been updated to ATSI. ATSI's public web
site is located at "http://www.atsi-transmission.com."

A change has been made in the timing for the recognition of "ATSI" as the
transmission provider mnemonic . NERC has informed us that upon reflection
it would be easier for them to accommodate the mnemonic change from "FE" to
"ATSI" at midnight on November 1 rather than 8:00 a.m. EST. So currently the
changeover is set for 0001 hours, EST (midnight) on November 1.

The control area designation remains "FE."  As you know, path POR/PODs are
based on the control areas. Thus, beginning November 1, the path name for
transfers to AEP, for example, will change from "E/FE/FE-AEP//" to
"E/ATSI/FE-AEP//." Note that the abbreviated path names, as used in the ECAR
ATC Coordination System, will not change (e.g., "FE-AEP"). Beginning
November 1, the Transmission Provider (TP) column on E-tags must show "ATSI"
not "FE" or they will be refused by ATSI's automatic tagging validation
software.

I hope this clarifies, rather than confuses. Please share this information
with the ATC Panel contacts.

Thank you,
Dick

Cool Site of the Day

 


The absolute height of European cool is the Vespa motor scooter. And those 
who love them REALLY love them - check out Vespa.org and see for yourself. 
How to fix 'em up, serial numbers of old models, tips for long road trips, 
lots and lots of pictures, even a list of international Vespa events. These 
people take their motor-scooterin' quite seriously and their is site is fun 
to cruise around - even if you don't own one. www.vespa.org

Fact of the Day

 


Long before one's box of Cap'n Crunch or Rice Krispies came with a plastic 
tchotchke, Kellogg's Corn Flakes ran the first breakfast cereal premium 
offer. In 1909, the Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet was available 
with the purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The offer ran for 
23 years. For more, click here.

It's beginning to get embarrassing how many things are out there ridiculing
this now everpresent election.    But way too many of them are too funny to
keep to oneself ...........

(by "Phil")

Can we count them with our nose?
Can we count them with our toes?
Should we count them with a band?
Should we count them all by hand?
If I do not like the count,
I will simply throw them out!

I will not let this vote count stand
I do not like them, AL GORE I am!

Can we change these numbers here?
Can we change them, calm my fears?
What do you mean, Dubya has won?
This is not fair, this is not fun
Lets count them upside down this time
Lets count until the state is mine!

I will not let this VOTE count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

I'm really ticked, I'm in a snit!
You have not heard the last of it!
I'll count the ballots one by one
And hold each one up to the sun!
I'll count, recount, and count some more!
You'll grow to hate this little chore

But I will not, cannot let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, Al Gore I am!

I won't leave office, I'm stayin' here!
I've glued my desk chair to my rear!
Tipper, Hillary, and Bubba too,
all telling me that I should sue!
We find the Electoral College vile!
RECOUNT the votes until I smile!

We do not want this vote to stand!
We do not like it, AL GORE I am!

How shall we count this ballot box?
Let's count it standing in our socks!
Shall we count this one in a tree?
And who shall count it, you or me?
We cannot, cannot count enough!
We must not stop, we must be tough!

I do not want this vote to stand!
I do not like it AL GORE I am!

I've counted till my fingers bleed!
And still can't fulfill my counting need!
I'll count the tiles on the floor!
I'll count, and count, and count some more!
And I will not say that I am done!
Until the counting says I've won!

I will not let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

What's that? What? What are you trying to say?
You think the current count should stay?
You do not like my counting scheme?
It makes you tense, gives you bad dreams?
Foolish people, you're wrong you'll see!
You're only care should be for me!

I WILL NOT LET THIS VOTE COUNT STAND!
I DO NOT LIKE IT. AND AL GORE I AM!

Subject: Prayer Requests for Wednesday, December 6 Bible Study


Following are the prayer requests and in case someone did not get it, the
story of the Christmas Tree.

Hope to see you all next Wednesday as we look at the Fruit of Spirit:
Peace.  Peace in the midst of storms.  Peace when there is not outward
reason for it.  Peace when it seems your world is falling apart.  That peace
that passes ALL understanding.

-- Carol

 <<prayer requests for December 6.xls>>  <<FOCUSING ON THE REASON FOR THE
SEASON.doc>>

Dear Heavenly Father:

Thank You once again for Your Word and Your Love.  So many will be traveling
this Christmas season, we ask for that "hedge of protection" that "canopy of
Divine Love and Protection" over each of us, our families, our loved ones.

Jesus, help us to be an even brighter light for You this year.  For our
loved ones - that husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, dear friend,
wife, parent - Lord, open their eyes to see You and to see their need for
You.  Show them that they really do not have to try to make it on their own.
You so long to help them.  But they push You away.  You are so patient and
loving.  Help us to be Your Hands that reach out to them, Your arms of love
that wrap around them.  Your ears to hear what they are NOT saying.  Eyes to
see through the mask of coldness, indifference, anger, insecurity, false
bravado, or whatever has been built up around their hearts.  Send Your
laborers across their paths to show them the way to You.  Direct our words
so that we will speak words of life and hope and healing.  Let us be Your
peace in the midst of the hustle and bustle.  A calm when everyone is
running crazy.

Father, for LaShanda and her precious baby - direct their steps and hold
them close to Your heart.  For Angie Wingo and Stephanie Cole and Pat
McFarland's niece, give these women a safe and easy delivery.  Above all,
healthy babies, anointed by You and Chosen from the foundation of the earth
to be born at this time.  Keep Your hand upon them Father and give these
women Your peace.

For Juan's dear brother and Josie Wicks' job search and Mary Rios' continued
employment - Lord, You know each situation and You will be their source and
supply.  Help Juan's brother be a light at Channel 22 as he goes about his
day.

Father for LaShanda's brother, Rita Ramirez' son Jose, Eloise's brother and
mother, Anita - these are suffering from depression.  This is not from You.
You give us a spirit of love, and peace and a sound mind.  We ask for Your
peace to cover these precious ones.  For LaShanda's brother and Jose, left
this be a time that You will work amazing creative miracles in their hearts.
We are so proud of Jose and love hearing how You have lifted out of the pit
he was descending.  Do the same for LaShanda's brother.  Show he the way to
You.

There are so many who do not know You Lord.  Mary Kay's husband and sweet
daughter, Doug, Duncan, Bruce and so many others who are near and dear to
our hearts - touch these lives Lord.  Make them Your own, Father.

Lord for this situation in Melissa's family.  You know all about it.  We
lift it up to You and ask that You make a clear and open path for
forgiveness, healing, peace and remove that stress that is weighing so
heavily upon her mother.

These addictive bondages that Angie Collins' sister is trapped with - set
her free according to Your Word.  Surround her with believers who will stand
with her and encourage her and help her when she is at her weakest.

Lord, there are so many other requests that we get daily.  It can be
overwhelming - all the hurt and sorrow and pain and sickness and disease.
All those with financial burdens and marriages that are on the brink of
disaster.  Children running from all You have to give.  Lord, we ask for
Your guidance, Your strength, Your protection.  Heal the hurt, Father, and
use us.  Use us to be You in a hurting world.  Use us and continue to mold
us into Your image.  Help us to stay focused on You and not get distracted.

In Jesus' Name...Amen

> SPECIAL DELIVERY
>
>      This past spring my wife passed away after a six-month battle with
> colon cancer.
>      She spent two months, last November and December, in a convalescent
> home.  I visited her every day and watched her condition change from bad
> to
> worse, although some days she would rally and seem to have a very good
> day.
> Her spirits rarely faltered as she maintained a cheerful outlook and
> seldom, if ever, complained about anything.
>      Each day, she had a request for some food that she had a craving for.
> These cravings ranged from all varieties of fruit to pizza.  On my visits,
> I always brought what she had requested.  She always had me help her with
> her laps, which consisted of her walking from her hospital bed to one end
> of the hospital corridor and back, once, twice and even three times, on a
> good day.
>      You see, she thought, and I hoped, that she would beat this terrible
> disease.  After New Years, I brought her home and she was very happy being
> in her own bed.  On the 12th of February, she quietly slipped away, with
> my
> daughter, a few close family members and me at her bedside.
>      Now with the holidays fast approaching my thoughts often turn to
> holiday celebrations of the past and my daughter often asks me what are we
> going to do without mom here?
>      The doorbell rang recently, and as I answered the door I was greeted
> by the postman.  He handed me a letter.  It was marked Special Delivery
> and
> as I read the return address, I saw that it was from the convalescent home
> where my wife had stayed.  I signed for the letter and thought to myself
> it
> was nice of someone from the home to remember us at this time of year.
>      There are no words to explain my elation as I took out the folded
> pages from the envelope and began to read the first page:
>
>      Thanksgiving, 1999
>
>      To My Beloved Family,
>
>        I do not know if I will be with you next Thanksgiving or not,
>        but please know that my spirit and my heart will be with you.
>
>        I am reminded this day of all the wonderful holidays that we
>        had together over the years.  Everyone was a precious day
>        to me, especially thinking about them now.  The two of you
>        must be strong and I am sure that you will be.
>
>        Richard, I hope that you decorate the table gaily with a nice
>        tablecloth, fine linen place mats, and our best china and
>        silverware.  Remember the two silver candle holders you
>        gave me on our 25th anniversary?  You could use those as
>        a center piece and maybe you and Tricia could each light
>        one candle as you say what you are thankful for.
>
>        Look in the big Betty Crocker cookbook?  Near the pages
>        on how to prepare a turkey for baking, you will find my
>        grandmother's old recipe and also aunt Clara's recipe for
>        fruit salad.  I am positive between you and Tricia you can
>        put together a dinner fit for a King -- and Queen, which
>        you both are.
>
>        Be assured, that wherever I am, I will in some way be
>        present with you and so you need not feel alone.
>
>        I am writing this from my hospital bed and Karen, the
>        charge nurse, is helping me . I told her to hold this letter
>        for me until next Thanksgiving and then to mail it Special
>        Delivery.
>
>        I must stop now as tears are blurring my vision.  Always
>        know that I love you both and will always be with you on
>        every occasion like this one.  I know that I can be proud
>        of you and that you will have a wonderful day.
>
>        May God and his blessings be with you always,
>                                             Mom

Subject: Fwd: Prayer Request

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

Dear Carol,

I would like to put my brother Alejandro Vazquez on your prayer list.  He was 
taken into police custody Saturday night, November 18, 2000.  He was on his 
car with my dad and my son on the night of his birthday.  Police took him 
into custody, his attorney is trying this morning to stop deportation 
procedures.  He is to go to another hearing in front of Judge Atkinson on  
Wednesday morning, November 22, 2000.  My dad is taking it to hard and since 
this incident took place his high blood pressure keeps going up.  We need 
your prayers at this time for both of them.  On behalf of my brother, please 
keep him on your prayers for safety return home and to try to stop 
deportation procedures.  

God Bless,

Nelly Carpenter

Hi Judy, Is Jennifer all right I heard they were in a car accident! I've
been trying to reach her because I know the kids party was canceled twice.
So I wanted to see if she was going to make one after all. Anyway, I tried
e-mailing her and no response. If you see her tell her I said hello and
hope that they are okay!

Take care,
Yvonne

FW:? A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza
?
I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

In case you all don't already have this, Pete gave me the rotating pager 
number for his group.  Hopefully this will enable us to get in contact with 
someone on a weekend if the need arises.

713-515-1826.

I would only use this number on the weekends as we SHOULD be able to contact 
someone during the week.

Thanks!

Brenna

As you probably know by now, Enron recently entered into a new relationship
with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a
more efficient ordering process.

Name:
Business Unit:
Department:
Phone / e-Mail:
Cost Center:
Number of Temporaries currently in use:
Average / Peak number of Temporaries used per week:
Skill sets / Positions required:

Phase I of the program, which starts January 2, 2001,  encompasses all
administrative/clerical temporary employees in the Houston area.  Please
note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on
assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer
any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be
available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.  Please note that the
current process for requesting temporary employees will remain in effect
through the end of the year.

Thank you,
The Enron Corp Implementation Team

     THE PERFECT PICTURE
When you THINK you have a bad day, remember this one from a
young mother..."I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came
into the bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper. "Although he
made a mess, he looked adorable, so I ran for my camera and took
a few shots.  They came out so well that I had copies made and
included one with each of our Christmas cards.
Days later, a relative called about the picture,  laughing hysterically
and suggesting I take a closer look. puzzled, I stared at the photo and
was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had captured
my reflection in the mirror-wearing nothing but a camera!"

       MY FOOTSTEPS?
An acquaintance of mine who is a physician told this story about her
then-four-year-old daughter. On the way to preschool, the doctor had
left her stethoscope on the car seat, and her little girl picked it up
and
began playing with it. Be still, my heart, thought my friend, my daughter

wants to follow in my footsteps!
Then the child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's.
May I take your order?"

           WISE CHILD
A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, "I'm
Mr.Sugarbrown's daughter." Her mother told her this was wrong, she
must say, "I'm Jane Sugarbrown." The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday
School and said, "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"
She replied,  "I thought I was, but mother says I'm not."

        TOO ROUGH
A little girl asked her mother, "Can I go outside and play with the
boys?" Her mother replied, "No, you can't play with the boys, they're
too rough.  The little girl thought about it for a few moments, and
asked, "If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?"

        THUMB SUCKING
A boy had reached four without giving up the habit of sucking his
thumb, though his mother had tried everything from bribery, to
reasoning to painting it with lemon juice to discourage the habit.
Finally she tried threats, warning her son that, "If you don't stop
sucking your thumb, your stomach is going to blow up like a
balloon." Later that day, walking in the park, mother and son saw
a pregnant woman sitting on a bench. The four-year-old considered
her gravely for a minute, then spoke to her saying, "Uh-oh .. I know
what you've been doing."

        THE LORD'S PRAYER
A mother was teaching her 3-year-old the Lord's prayer.  For several
evenings at bedtime she repeated it after her mother. One night she
said she was ready to solo. The mother listened with pride as she
carefully enunciated each word, right up to the end of the prayer. "Lead
us not into temptation, "she prayed, "but deliver us some e-mail, Amen."

        SO KEEP THE SINGING DOWN, OK?
A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little girl replied, "Because people are sleeping."

         THE PRESSED LEAF
A little boy opened the big and old family Bible. With fascination, he
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Then something fell out
of the Bible and he picked up and looked at it closely. It was an old
leaf from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,
look what I found,"  the boy called out.  "What have you got there,
dear?"
his mother asked.  With astonishment in the young boy' voice he
answered:  "It's  Adam's suit!"

Subject: Southeast Curves

There are currently three Southeast curves being marked:
R3 - Serc
R3A - Florida/Georgia Border
R3C - Into FRCC

When trading at one of these points please enter the deals as Eastern 
Prevailing Time.  Peak = HE 0800 to HE 2300.

We will change all deals that are live in the system as of last night.  If 
you have any questions, please give myself or Mitzie Scott a call.

Thanks,
Stacey (3-1870)

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Hi,

If you are not currently logging all documents sent to Joe, please begin 
doing so again.  I know the volume being sent downstairs is enormous, but we 
need to do this to cover ourselves.  I don't think we have been for about a 
month, but please start this again tomorrow.

just toss them.

I must admit, yesterday I was basically told, but not in these exact words, 
how ungrateful I  was.

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your "good eyes" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one -- Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  "Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand."  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!

Just a note to let you know how much and how often we think of you.  Hope 
you are having a terrific day!!
Annette

A Thanksgiving Thought:

The following is something to ponder:

If you have food in the refrigerator,
clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep ... you
are richer than 75% of this world.

If you have money in the bank, 
in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you
are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If you woke up this morning with more health
than illness ... you are more blessed than
the million who will not survive this week.

If you have never experienced the danger of
battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation...
you are ahead of 500 million people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear
of harassment, arrest, torture, or death ... you
are more blessed than three billion people in the
world.

If your parents are still alive and still married ...
you are very rare, even  in the United States.

If you hold up your head with a smile
on your face and are truly thankful ... 
you are blessed because the majority can, 
but most do not.

If you can hold someone's hand, 
hug them or even touch them on the
shoulder ... you are blessed
because you can offer healing touch.

If you can read this message, 
you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore,
you are more blessed than over two billion people
in the world that cannot read at all.

Have a good day, count your blessings, and pass
this along to remind everyone else how blessed we
all are.

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (=01&Enron=018) believes in conducting its business affairs in=
=20
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of=
=20
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=
es=20
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=
r=20
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=
=20
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that=20
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department wil=
l=20
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and=
=20
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical=
=20
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. =
=20
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

Judy,
We missed you all last night -- I wanted to inform you of two things:
1. Bible study is lesson 7 for Sabbath
2. Sunday there is a Baby Shower at 1:00 for Melinda -- do hope we can
have a good turnout.
Hope to see you Friday night for Youth Service.  Have a nice day.

All of the plant operations should be included on one of the deals listed 
below.  Just add a new leg to the correct deal number.  Plant generation 
should not be in the Hourly book.  If the hourly desk has taken a position, a 
Control Area ticket need to be created.

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA=01,s network services.

1. Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy=
.
a. Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3DAEP, SINK=3DMDEA, BID =
PRICE =3D=20
$0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2. Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy. =20
a. Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DLAGN, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3D(LAGN UNIT NAME), SIN=
K=3DMDEA,=20
BID PRICE =3D $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will b=
e=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXI=
A)=20
use POR=3DEES.=20

3. Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sep=
a=20
is not flowing and we can bring MGW=01,s in from the Tva border.
a. Ex.  We find 11 MGW=01,s  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DMDEA, SOURCE=3DLGE, SINK=3DMDEA, BID=
 PRICE =3D=20
$0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying=20
(displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarif=
y=20
this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered=
=20
F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must=
=20
request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is=
=20
NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load=20
share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem. =
 I=20
just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with=20
Entergy Transmission.

PRAYER WHEEL

When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to
you.... That's all you have to do....There is nothing attached....This
is powerful.... Just send this to four people and watch God answer
prayer to work in your life.

Do not break this, please.... Prayer is one of the best free gifts we
receive.... There is no cost but a lot of rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another. Thanks for praying.

Hello sunshine.  I haven't heard from you, I trust everything is okay.  I 
have sad news to report.  My neighbor died this morning. You remember the 
little neighbor who got burned, and no one told her that her father had lung 
cancer, well he expired.  Please pray for the family.  I feel so sorry for 
his wife.  I know I never have good news, and if you ever get tired of me 
telling you bad news just let me know.  The devil is so busy, I have to ask 
for help to fight him.  I really appreciate your willing ear. My other 
neighbor went to the emergency room Monday and they will keep her until 
today. She 
thought she was having a heart attack.  We do not know what is wrong with her 
she will go for test on next Thursday.  Help me pray for these families.  You 
know I love you.  I will talk to you later.  Tell all the Saints I said 
hello. 

Be Blessed in Jesus Name 
Kat

Subject: Silent Prayer



Now I sit me down in school Where praying is against the rule
For this great nation under God Finds mention of Him very odd.
If Scripture now the class recites, It violates the Bill of Rights.
And anytime my head I bow Becomes a Federal matter now.  Our hair
can be purple, orange or green, That's no offense; it's a freedom scene.
The law is specific, the law is precise. Prayers spoken aloud are a
serious vice. For praying in a public hall Might offend someone with
no faith at all. In silence alone we must meditate, God's name is
prohibited by the state. We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. They've outlawed guns,
but FIRST the Bible. To quote the Good Book makes me liable. We can
elect a pregnant Senior Queen, And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, We're taught that such
"judgments" do not belong. We can get our condoms and birth controls,
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. But the Ten Commandments
are not allowed, It's scary here I must confess, When chaos reigns the
school's a mess. So, Lord, this silent plea I make: Should I be shot;
My soul please take!

module is incorporated into easy to read graphs,
charts and custom interactive maps.  Below is a snapshot of the new content:

COMPUTING & NETWORK UPGRADES
Recently our ISP implemented several upgrades to improve connectivity to all 
of our failover uplinks and provide increased
reliability during an outage with any one upstream provider. Unfortunately 
during this upgrade some of you were unable to
get to our website the morning of February 27th. I apologize for this and 
want to re-confirm that we try to never perform
any upgrades or maintenance during business hours.  FriedWire is also very 
pleased to announce that our entire system will
be upgraded in the next 30-days.  We have entered into a contract with Verado 
(formerly Firstworld) to migrate all of our
systems to their facility in Denver, Colorado.  With this migration we should 
see increased performance and reliability in
all of our systems.

OLD DATA IN MAPS?  RESET YOUR BROWSER CACHE SETTINGS!
If you have seen any maps or charts that seem contain old data then please 
make sure that you set your browser NOT to cache
web pages.  Internet Explorer users can do this by going to the "Tools" menu 
and selecting "Internet Options".  On the
General tab press the "Settings" button for Temporary Internet Files and set 
"Check for newer versions of stored pages" to
"Every visit to the page".  Netscape Navigator users can do the same by going 
to the "Tools" menu and selecting "Edit" then
"Preferences".  Select "Advanced" then "Cache" in the Category window and set 
"Document in cache is compared to document on
network" to "Every time".

NUCLEAR OUTAGE MAP
New labels on the map provide unit-level detail on outages.

We appreciate your business and look forward to providing additional energy 
information to your organization.  Please call
us at 303-447-0288 if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Bill Townsend
President
FriedWire Inc.

If you could pass along to the Hourly group that the correct CP for Ameren

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20

Subject: Christmas Carol



There is one Christmas Carol that has always baffled me.

What in the world do leaping lords, French hens, swimming

swans, and especially the partridge who won't come our of

the pear tree have to do with Christmas?



Here is one explanation:



>From 1558 until 1829, Roman Catholics in England were not

permitted to practice their faith openly.  Someone during

that era wrote this carol as a catechism song for young

Catholics.  It has two levels of meaning: the surface

meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of

their church. Each element in the carol has a code word

for a religious reality which the children could remember.



The partridge in a pear tree was Jesus Christ.



Two turtle doves were the Old and New Testaments.



Three French hens stood for faith, hope and love.



The four calling birds were the four gospels of

Matthew, Mark, Luke & John.



The five golden rings recalled the Torah or Law,

the first five books of the Old Testament.



The six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation.



Seven swans a-swimming represented the sevenfold gifts of

the Holy Spirit--Prophesy, Serving, Teaching, Exhortation, Contribution,

Leadership, and Mercy.



The eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes.



Nine ladies dancing were the nine fruits of the Holy

Spirit--Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness,

Faithfulness,Gentleness, and Self Control.



The ten lords a-leaping were the ten commandments.



The eleven pipers piping stood for the eleven faithful disciples.



The twelve drummers drumming symbolized the twelve

points of belief in the Apostles' Creed.



So there is your history for today, although I can't vouch

for its accuracy, but I found it an interesting possibility

The Flu Vaccine may come in and be available in the next couple of week.
Since Enron let us know in October to not rely on Enron alone for 
vaccinations, most of you may have already have shots.

But, if you plan to be vaccinated at Enron, they are taking requests by 
e-mail, and will contact those of the waiting list when the vaccine is 
here.   You would sign up using Health_Center.com.

For any other questions, call Health Center at x3-6100.

thanks,
Sandy

Conveniently Forgotten Facts??
Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow Black Panther
named Alex Rackley needed to die. Rackley was suspected of disloyalty.
Rackley was first tied to a chair. Once safely immobilized his friends
tortured
him for hours by, among other things,pouring boiling water on him. When they

got
tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member Warren Kimbo took Rackley
outside and put a bullet in his head.  Rackley's body was later found
floating in a river about 25 miles north of New Haven, Conn.




Perhaps at this point you're curious as to what happened to these Black
Panthers. In 1977, that's only eight years later, only one of the killers
was
still in jail. The shooter, Warren Kimbro, managed to get a scholarship to
Harvard. He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut State
College.
Isn't that something? As a '60s radical you can pump a bullet into someone's

head, and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an assistant
college dean! Only in America!




Erica Huggins was the lady who served the Panthers by boiling the water for
Mr. Rackley's torture. Some years later Ms. Huggins was elected to a
California
School Board.




How in the world do you think these killers got off so easy?  Maybe it
was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of

the
Panthers.  These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale
University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers
during
their trial.




One of these people was none other than Bill Lan Lee. Mr. Lee, or Mr. Lan
Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean. He isn't a member of a
California
School Board. He is now head of the US Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division.




O.K., so who was the other Panther defender?  Is this other notable
Panther defender now a school board member? Is this other Panther apologist
now
an assistant college dean? No, neither!  The other Panther defender was,
like Lee, a radical law student
at Yale University at the time. She is now
known as The "smartest woman in the world."  She is none other than the
Democratic candidate for the US Senate from
the State of New York----our
lovely First Lady, the incredible Hillary Rodham Clinton.




And now, as Paul Harvey says, you know (the rest of the story).

Pass
this on! She deserves the press................

 Subject: FW: 11 things In Life - worth reading

1. It hurts to love
someone and not be loved in
return, But what is more
painful is to love someone and
never find the courage
to let that person know
how you feel.

2.  A sad thing in life is
when you meet someone who means a
lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was
never meant to be and you just have to let go.

3. The best kind of friend
is the kind you can sit on a porch
swing with, never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation
you've ever had.

4. It's true that we don't know what
we've got until we lose it, but
it's also true that we don't know what we've
been missing until it arrives.

5.  It takes only a minute
to get a crush on someone, an hour to
like someone, and a day to love someone- but it takes
a lifetime to forget someone.

6. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.

7. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want
to go; be what you want to be, because you have only
one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.

8.  Always put yourself in the other's shoes. If you
feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person too.

9. A careless word may kindle strife;  a cruel word may
wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving
word may heal and bless.

10. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

11. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, ends with a tear.
When you were born, you were crying and everyone around
you was smiling.  Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying.

Send this to your friends and send it back to the person who sent
it to you.  Print this out and keep it in your pocket or purse and
pull
it out whenever you need a hint for Life. Always remember - Life
is precious, don't let it slip by.

Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to "make pancakes," for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

Please take time between now and year's end to check the Vacation hours 
balance you have in the SAP system.   If there is a discrepancy, please ask 
HR to correct, and keep me advised should you need time sheet copies.

Carolyn usually has to approve reports at year end (or Jan-2001) for Vacation 
carry-over, so it helps if we are sure of our hours prior to her receiving 
this report.

thanks everyone,
Sandy

Do you need ink AGAIN?  There's so much great stuff out here on the web,
that you want to print and share, but you think of how much it's going
to cost you for those ink cartridges or refills and you hesitate...no
more reason to hesitate!!  You can get affordable ink cartridges and
refills on the internet for much lower than you pay in a retail office
supply store...just check out the folks at Mr Inkman!!

the holidays coming up it has a great idea for that person you don't
know what to get...but someone you think is the greatest.  It's called

out and see what they have to offer.  I ordered one today!!

Eve,

On these confirms, the counterparty is simply calculating what the premium is 
on the option.  As long as they are not crossing anything out and writing in 
the decimal amount, the confirms are okay to execute.

Thanks.
Kevin

God bless and  have a nice day!

"Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives
and email buddies reading this right now.
Show them a new revelation of your love
and power.  Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister
to their spirit at this very moment.
Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.
Where there is self-doubt, release a renewed
confidence through your grace, In Jesus precious Name."
Amen

Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EGM Coal & Emissions
The November and December NYMEX market remains very tight.  Offers in the O=

and the last trade was around $120.50.  The sharp drop in prices was caused=
=20
in large part by the news of Dominion Virginia Power settling the New Sourc=
e=20
Review lawsuit brought against it by the state of NY and the EPA Continuing=

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Prayer Wheel

Let's see the devil stop this one! Here's what the
wheel is all about. When you receive this, say a
prayer for the person that sent it to you....That's
all you have to do....There is nothing attached....
This is so powerful....Just send this to seven people
and watch God's answer to prayer work in your life. Do
not stop the wheel, please.... Of all the free gifts
we may receive, Prayer is the very best one..... There
are no costs, but wonderful rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another.
Amen.

A Prayer

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now. I am asking You to minister to their spirit
at this very moment.

Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy.

Where there is self doubting, release a renewed
confidence in Your ability to work through them.

Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to
give them understanding, patience, and strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.

Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to
renew them by revealing Your nearness, and by drawing
them into greater intimacy with You.

Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to
them Your courage. Where there is a sin blocking them,reveal it, and
break
its hold over my friend's life.

Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and
raise up leaders, and friends to support, and
encourage them. Give each of them discernment to
recognize the evil forces around them, and reveal to
them the power they have in You to defeat it.

I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In love, Your Friend

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something Christ would do.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

You will need special permission to access the files located in 
M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME !!! WE SERVE THE MOST WONDERFUL GOD !!!!


Subject: Read the story before you look at picture


Appreciating Life!!!

First read and then see the picture  The picture appeared in the November
16
edition of "The National Enquirer." It should be "The Picture of the Year,"
or perhaps, "The Picture of the Decade."  The picture is that of a
21-week-old unborn baby named Samuel Alexander Armas, who is being operated
on by a surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina
bifida and would not survive if removed from the mother's womb. Little
Samuel's mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of

Dr. Bruner's remarkable surgical procedure.

Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs

these special operations while the baby is still in the womb. In the
procedure, a C-section removes the uterus and the doctor makes a small
incision to operate on the baby. During the surgery on little Samuel, the
little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand through the incision
and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger. The photograph captures this
amazing event with perfect clarity.

The editors titled the picture, "Hand of Hope." The text explaining the
picture begins, "The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel Alexander Armas
emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as

if thanking the doctor for the gift of life." That picture is graphic
reminder that growing in the womb of his or her mother is a baby. It is not
a "glob of tissue," or "product of conception." That pre-born baby is a
human being with all the emotions, will and personality of any human being.
That picture says it in a way that a thousand words cannot. Little Samuel's
mother said they "wept for days" when they saw the picture. She said, "The
photo reminds us my pregnancy isn't about disability or illness, it's about
a little person." That's what it's always been about.

Subject: Adopt a Child Program

In the Spirit of giving, the Global Group has just adopted two children from 
Burrus Elementary School.  

The girl's name is Charmaine Holmes.  She is in the 4th grade and enjoys 
playing ball with her friends.  She hopes to be an actress when she grows 
up.  Her favorite story's to read are those by Beverly Cleary.

The boy's name is Alex Reymundo.  He is also in the 4th grade and likes to 
play football with his friends.  He hopes to be a police officer when he 
grows up.  His favorite series to read is Goosebumps.

Anyone who would like to participate in donating funds, please have your 
contributions to me by November 30th.  The estimated cost per child is 
$200.00.  Each individual who donates will be eligible for the drawing for 
the famous "Enron Kids" T-shirt.  

If you would like to volunteer to go shopping, gift wrap the gifts or take 
the gifts to the school, please see me by November 30th.

=09=09Renaming Favorites and Bookmarks =20
=09=09
=09=09It's a good idea to save your favorite sites in your Favorites (Inter=
net=20
Explorer) or Bookmarks (Netscape) files. Sometimes the name of the=20
favorite/bookmark isn't what you want, however -- it might be blank, or in =
a=20
foreign language (like Japanese), or maybe it just says "index" or somethin=
g;=20
or "welcome to BlaahBlah.net, the blah-blahest site on the Net." It's easy =
to=20
give it an easier-to-handle handle. In Favorites, just open Organize=20
Favorites. Your rename button is there with other useful buttons for=20
organizing your bookmarks. In Netscape Bookmarks, just open Edit Bookmarks.=
=20
Highlight the bookmark you want to rename. Right-click to bring up the pop-=
up=20
menu, and select Properties. Just type the new name in the Name box, and th=
en=20
click OK.

I have a prayer request for you.  My dad was diagnosed yesterday with acute 
lukemia.  He is 86 years old but looks and acts more like someone in their 
late 60s or early 70s.  He is a wonderful Christian man (he's been a Baptist 
deacon for 40+ years).  Please pray that he will make the right decision on 
his treatment options and that he will not have to suffer.  Thanks.

True Story - many of you probably already know about the pitfalls, traps, and 
predators on the internet, but this is something to consider for your 
children and families.  This story is something those of you with children 
who are home alone and/or enjoy chat rooms, talk groups, buddy lists etc 
should be aware of.  Share this with others you think would benefit.  Thanks.


>> Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she
>> walked toward home.  The thought of being followed
>> made her heart beat faster.  "You're being silly," she
>> told herself, "no one is following you."  To be safe,
>> she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up
>> with her pace.  She was afraid to look back and she
>> was glad she was almost home.
>>
>> Shannon said a quick prayer, "God please get me
>> home safe."  She saw the porch light burning and
>> ran the rest of the way to her house. Once  inside,
>> she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved
>> to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the
>> window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk
>> was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa, she
>> decided to grab a snack and get on-line.
>>
>> She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213.
>> She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was
>> on.  She sent him an instant message:
>>
>> ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on!  I thought
>> someone was following me home today.  It was
>> really weird!
>>
>> GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV.  Why
>> would someone be following you? Don't you live
>> in a safe neighborhood?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course I do.  LOL I guess it was my
>> imagination cuz' I didn't see anybody when I looked
>> out.
>>
>> GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on-line.
>> You haven't done that have you?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course not.  I'm not stupid you know.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school
>> today?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Yes and we won!!
>>
>> GoTo123: That's great!  Who did you play?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We played the Hornets.  LOL.
>> Their uniforms are so gross!  They look like
>> bees. LOL
>>
>> GoTo123: What is your team called?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats.  We
>> have tiger paws on our uniforms.  They are really
>> kewl.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you pitch?
>>
>> ByAngel213: No I play second base.  I got to go.  My
>> homework has to be done before my parents get
>> home.  I don't want them mad at me. Bye!
>>
>> GoTo123: Catch you later. Bye
>>
>> Meanwhile......
>> GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to
>> search for her profile. When it came up, he highlighted
>> it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to
>> write down what he knew about Angel so far.
>>             Her name: Shannon
>>             Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985
>>             Age:13
>>             State where she lived: North Carolina
>>             Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and
>>             going to the mall.
>>
>> Besides this information, he knew she lived in Canton
>> because she had just told him. He knew she stayed
>> by herself until 6:30 p.m. every afternoon until her
>> parents came home from work. He knew she played
>> softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team,
>> and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her
>> favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew
>> she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior
>> High School.  She had told him all this in the
>> conversations they had on-line. He had enough
>> information to find her now.
>>
>> Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on
>> the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't
>> want them to make a scene and stop her from walking
>> home from the softball games. Parents were always
>> overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her
>> wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had
>> brothers and sisters, her parents wouldn't be so
>> overprotective.
>>
>> By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the
>> footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing
>> when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was
>> then that the memory came back. She glanced up
>> from her second base position to see a man watching
>> her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind
>> first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He
>> didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear
>> she had felt.
>>
>> After the game, he sat on a bleacher while she talked
>> to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as
>> she walked past him.  He nodded and she smiled
>> back.  He noticed her name on the back of her shirt
>> He knew he had found her. Quietly, he walked a safe
>> distance behind her. It was only a few blocks to
>> Shannon's home, and once he saw where she lived
>> he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he
>> had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the
>> time came to go to Shannon's house.  He drove to a
>> fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make
>> his move.
>>
>> Shannon was in her room later that evening when she
>> heard voices in the living room. "Shannon, come
>> here," her father called.  He sounded upset and she
>> couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see
>> the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.
>> "Sit down," her father began, "this man has just told
>> us a most interesting story about you." Shannon
>> moved cautiously to a chair across from the man
>> How could he tell her parents anything? She had
>> never seen him before today!  "Do you know who I
>> am Shannon?"  The man asked.
>>
>> "No," Shannon answered.
>>
>> "I am a police officer and your online friend, GoTo123."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "That's impossible! GoTo is
>> a kid my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!"
>>
>> The man smiled. "I know I told you all that, but it
>> wasn't true You see, Shannon, there are people on-
>> line who pretend to be kids; I was one of them.  But
>> while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong
>> to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from
>> predators. I came here to find you to teach you how
>> dangerous it is to give out too much information to
>> people on-line. You told me enough about yourself to
>> make it easy for me to find you. Your name, the
>> school you went to, the name of your ball team and
>> the position you played. The number and name on
>> your jersey just made finding you a breeze."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "You mean you don't live in
>> Michigan?"
>>
>> He laughed. "No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe
>> to think I was so far away, didn't it?"
>>
>> She nodded.
>>
>> "I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she
>> wasn't as lucky.  The guy found her and murdered her
>> while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell
>> anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time
>> on-line.  The wrong people trick you into giving out
>> information a little here and there on-line.  Before you
>> know it, you have told them enough for them to find
>> you without even realizing you have done it.  I hope
>> you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again"
>>
>> "I won't," Shannon promised solemnly.
>>
>> "Will you tell others about this so they will be safe
>> too?"
>>
>> "It's a promise!"
>>

	When the planets align properly, two hot topics collide together to form a 
parodist's dream. The folks at Brunching have come up with a winner in "Am I 
President or Not?" - a play on the latest trend to sweep Webdom, AmIHotOrNot, 
and the endless InjunctionFest that our Presidential Election has turned 
into. Perfect to play with while taking a break from work or to forward to 
your friends to remind them that we still don't know who will be running the 
country next month. www.brunching.com/cgi/amipresidentornot

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?
=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=

para Blondi...errr  Charlie:

ogle:  mirar codiciosamente o insinuante
doily:  tapete

This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza
?
I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Subject: A mother's thoughts


Hi ladies.  Even though mother's day has past, I thought you would enjoy 
reading this e-mail I received last week.  It's real good.

A Mother's Thoughts:

We are sitting at lunch when my daughter casually mentions that she and her 
husband are thinking of "starting a family." "We're taking a survey," she 
says, half-joking. "Do you think I should have a baby?"

"It will change your life, "I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.

"I know," she says, "no more sleeping in on weekends, no more
spontaneous vacations...."

But that is not what I meant at all.  I look at my daughter, trying to
decide what to tell her.  I want her to know what she will never learn in 
childbirth classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child 
bearing will heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an 
emotional wound so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.  I consider 
warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking "What 
if that had been MY child?" That every plane crash,every house fire will 
haunt her.  That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder 
if anything could be worse than watching your child die.  I look at her 
carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter
how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the
primitive level of a bear protecting her cub.  That an urgent call of "Mom!" 
will cause her to drop a souffl, or her best crystal without a moment's 
hesitation.  I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has 
invested in her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.  
She might arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an 
important
business meeting and she will think of her baby's sweet smell.  She will have 
to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just to make 
sure her baby is all right.  I want my daughter to know that everyday 
decisions will no longer be
routine.  That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room
rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right 
there, in the midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of 
independence and gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a 
child molester may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be 
at the office, she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.
Looking at my attractive daughter, I want to assure her that eventually she 
will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about 
herself.  That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once 
she has a child.  That she would give it up in a moment to save her 
offspring, but will also begin to hope for more years-not to accomplish her 
own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know 
that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.  My 
daughter's relationship with her husband will change,
but not in the way she thinks.  I wish she could understand how much more you 
can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to 
play with his child.  I think she should know that she will fall in love with 
him again for reasons she would now find every unromantic.  I wish my 
daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who 
have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving.  I hope she will 
understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become 
temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my
children's future.  I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of 
seeing your child learn to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly 
laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first 
time.  I want  her to  taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.  My 
daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes.

"You'll never regret it," I finally say. Then I reach across the table, 
squeeze my daughter's hand and offer a silent prayer for her,and
for me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this 
most wonderful of callings.  This blessed gift from God that of being a 
Mother.

Please share this with a Mom that you know or a future Mom you know.

	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum

to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year." 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself.

	Hollywood Hauntings is a creepy little venture dealing with celebrity 
hauntings, Hollywood ghosts and the like. Although the site is in its 
infancy, there's still plenty of juicy stuff here. Check out the great 
Hauntings section for some helpful cross- referencing - you can browse by 
celebrity involvement, haunted hotels, haunted houses, movie studios and 
curses. Confused by some of the terminology? Then click Glossary for a quick 
primer on terms like 'crisis apparition.' A great links section provides 
added entertainment and a horror movie review section is slowly getting off 
the ground, too. A strange topic, to be sure, but stories on James Dean's 
Porsche and Marilyn Monroe's stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel will make 
you want to sleep with the lights on. http://gothic.vei.net/hollywood

	One day inside the Cathedral of Pisa, Galileo Galilei watched a monk draw a 
large chandelier toward himself, light the candles and release it. In the 
chandelier's constant swinging motion Galileo saw the potential for keeping 
time. Although the first proper pendulum clock, created by Christian Huygens, 
was not constructed until after Galileo's death, it was his early theory that 
sparked the invention. For more, click here.

Once upon a time there lived a king. 
The king had a beautiful daughter, 
the princess. 

But there was a problem. 
Everything the princess touched would melt. 
No matter what; 
metal, 
wood, 
plastic 
anything she touched would melt. 

Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
Nobody would dare marry her. 

The king despaired. 
What could he do to help his daughter? 

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the king, 

"If your daughter touches one thing 
that does not melt in her hands, 
she will be cured." 

The king was overjoyed. 

The next day, 
he held a competition. 
Any man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry her 
and inherit the king's wealth. 

Three young princes took up the challenge. 

The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
The prince went away sadly. 

The second prince brought a huge diamond, 
thinking that diamond is the hardest substance 
in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 

The third prince approached. 
He told the princess, 
"Put your hand in my pocket and feel what 
is in there." 
The princess did as she was told, 
though she turned red. 
She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 

The king was overjoyed. 
Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 
And the third prince married the princess 
and they both lived happily ever after. 


Question: 

What was the object in the prince's pants? 


(Scroll down for the answer) 

? 

? 

? 

? 

? 

They were M&M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.

What were you thinking?

Subject: MOM


JOB DESCRIPTION: Long term team players needed for challenging permanent
work in an often chaotic environment. Candidates must possess excellent
communication and organizational skills and be willing to work various
hours, which will include evenings and weekends and frequent 24 hour shifts
on call. Some overnight travel required, including trips to primitive
camping sites on rainy weekends and endless sports tournaments in faraway
cities. Travel expenses not reimbursed. Extensive courier duties also
required.

RESPONSIBILITIES: This is for the rest of your life. Must be willing to be
hated at least temporarily, until someone needs $5 to go skating. Must be
willing to bite tongue repeatedly. Also, must possess the physical stamina
of a pack mule and be able to go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds flat
in case, this time, the screams from the backyard are not someone just
crying wolf. Must be willing to face stimulating technical challenges, such
as small gadget repair, mysteriously sluggish toilets and stuck zippers.
Must screen phone calls, maintain calendars and coordinate production of
multiple homework projects. Must have ability to plan and organize social
gatherings for clients of all ages and mental outlooks.  Must be willing to
be indispensable one minute, an embarrassment the next. Must handle assembly
and product safety testing of a half million cheap, plastic toys and battery
operated devices. Must always hope for the best but be prepared for the
worst. Must assume final, complete accountability for the quality of the end
product. Responsibilities also include floor maintenance and janitorial work
throughout the facility.

POSSIBILITY FOR ADVANCEMENT AND PROMOTION: Virtually none. Your job is to
remain in the same position for years, without complaining, constantly,
training and updating your skills, so that those in your charge can
ultimately surpass you.

PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE: None required, unfortunately. On-the-job training
offered on a continually exhausting basis.

WAGES AND COMPENSATION: You pay them, offering frequent raises and bonuses.
A balloon payment is due when they turn 18 because of the assumption that
college will help them become financially independent. When you die, you
give them whatever is left. The oddest thing about this reverse-salary
scheme is that you actually enjoy it and wish you could only do more.

BENEFITS: While no health or dental insurance, no pension, no tuition
imbursement, no paid holidays and no stock options are offered, job supplies
limitless opportunities for personal growth and free hugs for life if you
play your cards right.

Forward this on to all the MOM's you know, in appreciation for everything

This is really great, it was through my mother's death that I was blessed 
with meeting Tim. The Lord is faithful and so good to us !!


MOM'S LAST LAUGH.....

Consumed by my loss, I didn't notice the hardness of the
pew where I sat.  I was at the funeral of my dearest friend - my mother.

She finally had lost her long battle with cancer. The hurt
was so intense, I found it hard to breathe at times.

Always supportive, Mother clapped loudest at my school
plays, held a box of tissues while listening to my first heartbreak, 
comforted me at my father's death, encouraged me in college,
and prayed for me my entire life.

When Mother's illness was diagnosed, my sister had a new
baby and my brother had recently married his childhood sweetheart, so it fell 
on me, the 27-year-old middle child without entanglements, to take care of 
her. I counted it an honor.

"What now, Lord?" I asked sitting in church. My life
stretched out before me as an empty abyss. My brother sat stoically with his 
face toward the cross while clutching his wife's hand. My sister sat slumped 
against her husband's shoulder,
his arms around her as she cradled their child.

All so deeply grieving, no one noticed I sat alone.

My place had been with our mother, preparing her meals,
helping her walk, taking her to the doctor, seeing to her medication, reading 
the Bible together. Now she was with the Lord.

My work was finished, and I was alone.

I heard a door open and slam shut at the back of the
church. Quick footsteps hurried along the carpeted floor. An exasperated 
young man looked around briefly and then sat
next to me. He folded his hands and placed them on his
lap. His eyes were brimming with tears. He began to sniffle.

"I'm late," he explained, though no explanation was
necessary.  After several eulogies, he leaned over and commented, "Why do 
they keep calling Mary by the name of 'Margaret'?

"0h" "Because that was her name, Margaret. Never Mary. No
one called her 'Mary,'" I whispered. I wondered why this person couldn't have 
sat on the other side of the church. He interrupted my grieving with his 
tears and fidgeting.

Who was this stranger anyway?

"No, that isn't correct," he insisted, as several people
glanced over at us whispering, "Her name is Mary, Mary Peters."

"That isn't who this is."

"Isn't this the Lutheran church?"

"No, the Lutheran church is across the street."   "Oh."

"I believe you're at the wrong funeral, Sir."

The solemnness of the occasion mixed with the realization
of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as laughter. I cupped 
my hands over my face, hoping it would be interpreted as sobs.  The creaking 
pew gave me away. Sharp looks from other mourners only made the situation 
seem more hilarious. I peeked at the bewildered, misguided man seated beside 
me. He was laughing, too, as he glanced around,
deciding it was too late for an uneventful exit.  I imagined
Mother laughing.

At the final "Amen," we darted out a door and into the
parking lot. "I do believe we'll be the talk of the town," he smiled. He said 
his name was Rick and since he had missed his aunt's funeral, asked me out 
for a cup of coffee.

That afternoon began a lifelong journey for me with this
man who attended the wrong funeral, but was in the right place.

A year after our meeting, we were married at a country church where he was 
the assistant pastor. This time we both arrived at the same church, right on 
time.

In my time of sorrow, God gave me laughter. In place of
loneliness, God gave me love. This past June we celebrated
our twenty-second wedding anniversary.

Whenever anyone asks us how we met, Rick tells them, "Her
mother and my Aunt Mary introduced us, and it's truly a match made in heaven."

                       ------------------------

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed
of you before my  Father."

Not ashamed Pass this on . . . only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God.

 He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and everyday. Without Him, I would be nothing. Without him, 
I am nothing, but with Him I can do all things, through Christ that 
strengthens me.  Phil 4:13

If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all the marvelous
things he has done for you. Send this to ten people and the person who sent 
it to you!

Good morning.  Welcome to Tuesday, December 19th.

"Trust in the LORD, and do good; so you will live in the land, and
enjoy security.  Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the
desires of your heart.  Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and
he will act.  He will make your vindication shine like the light, and
the justice of your cause like the noonday.  Be still before the LORD,
and wait patiently for him; do not fret over those who prosper in
their way, over those who carry out evil devices."  Psalm 37:3-7

"Are you ready for Christmas?"

The odds are pretty good that you are going to hear that question
today, either spoken to you or by you.  It is our seasonal snappy
conversation starter.  And we all know what it means...  NOT "Are you
ready to celebrate the birth of Jesus?" or "Are you considering again
the degree to which you are willing to surrender your life to the
lordship of the newly born King?" or "Do you trust that, when Jesus
comes again, you will be among those who will spend eternity with
him?"

"Are you ready for Christmas?" means "Do you have your shopping all
done, your presents wrapped, your cards in the mail, your packages to
UPS, your house decorated, your travel plans in order?"

Strange, isn't it, how Christmas transforms normal human parents into
the shipping and receiving department for children who already have
enough?  Our fascination with Christmas has far more to do with the
presents under the tree than with the incarnate presence of Jesus.

And so this season of waiting becomes an almost obsessive
preoccupation with what we might get...  We sing about not pouting,
shouting, crying, being bad or good... for goodness sake?  Not really,
reminders to be good at this time of year is not about the psalmist's
advice to "Trust in the LORD, and do good; so you will live in the
land, and enjoy security."  In our day, we throw a bone to being good
so that Santa will be good to us.

That's why, in just a few more days, "Are you ready for Christmas?"
will be replaced as a snappy conversation starter by "Was Santa good
to you?"

So we wait.  We wait for Sunday...for the festive worship service?
For the singing of carols and receiving Jesus again in bread and wine?
For gathering with friends and family, those in whom God also dwells
for us?  Or do we just wait to see what we are going to get?

Maybe all this preoccupation with presents over presence isn't all
bad...  At least it gives a sense of urgency to the season, something
that gives us at least a taste of the urgency in the faithful's
waiting for the Messiah to come, and to come again.

In the meantime?  In the meantime we would do well to do as the
psalmist advises, "  Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you
the desires of your heart."  If we take some time during this last
week of shopping before Christmas to remember that it is Jesus for
whom we are waiting, it is God's presence which we are adoring, then
maybe the real miracle of Christmas will happen in our lives.  Not
that we will get everything we desire, but that everything we desire
will be holy.

Let us pray:  Draw near to us, dear Lord, in this season of waiting.
By the power of your Spirit, fill us with holy desires and the ability
to see through the glitter of this season, through the presents under
the tree, to your presence in our lives.  In Jesus' name.  Amen.

Hi,  I am trying to get an accurate number of the volume that we are faxing 
each day.  If each of you will email to me the total number of liquids and 
the total number of mdeals that you fax each day I will be able to keep a 
running total.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

  Some cute bumper stickers!

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said "NO" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.
  Don't re-elect them!

This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will send it 
shortly.

Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region
of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a
little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.

Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas
began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black
Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking,
loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region.
One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a
master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he
felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He
was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in
Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy
Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife
and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast
of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and
spirit.

The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a
pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a
parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As
he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in
light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such
wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see
the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he
happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red
with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my
words of course):

The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for
our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around
(all the other trees loose their leaves and "die") but only the evergreen
goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the
Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.

The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon
that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.

The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure
through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the
Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He
said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.

As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of
the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to
a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center
with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until
Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when
the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when
gifts are usually exchanged.

While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating
all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and
maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the
season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a "color theme" or mix and
match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your
home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's
pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved
friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have
unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray

"Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine
through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place
in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that
gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your
covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open
a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the
keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your
Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was
raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person
You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each
one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a
sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown
and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on
the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the
lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me.
Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing,
dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my
arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I
ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!"

Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real
difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our
hearts.

I love you all....Carol Word

Hey guys, 

What's going on strangers??  Haven't heard from you guys in a while,  I guess 
we are all busy in our own little world.  Just wanted to say hello and see 
how yall were doing.  I also have some SPECIAL NEWS I wanted to share with 
you guys.  Here it goes..........



My first and BIGGEST news is that Anthony and I are expecting, yes a BABY!  
I'm 3 1/2 months and due July.  So is everyone SHOCKED!  Sorry for delay in 
telling you guys but I had a little accident so I wanted to make sure 
everything was okay!  Everything is fine!  My second news is that we are also 
in the process of buying a house so hopefully that will turn out okay.  Now 
I'm realizing how much of a headache it is to do all this paper work and all 
the closing costs that add up.  If you homeowners have any tips for me pass 
them on I need all the help I can get.        I'll stop here cause I'm sure 
you guys don't have time to do all this reading.  Just wanted to share some 
of my good news with all of you. 

Love, 
Melissa

Subject: Stacey's Baby Shower

We are copying an idea presented for Bernice's baby shower for Stacey, but 
with a Holiday flare. Stacey wasn't planning on putting up a Christmas tree 
since she's been having it rather rough here lately. SO, we are doing a 
'Money Tree', or actually, a 'Money Christmas Tree'. Susan & I will be 
purchasing a small artificial Christmas tree & decorating it with baby 
booties and such. Anyone who would like to donate $ rather than purchase a 
gift is welcome to participate. We will be tucking the money into the little 
booties & topping the tree off with a Baby's First Christmas ornament. That 
way, little baby Richardson will have a Christmas Tree, mommy can buy what 
she wants/needs, and the booties can be taken off & worn to keep the 
ittle-bittie baby toes warm in the winter. We will be collecting donations 
thru Thursday afternoon. We will have a card available to sign for those who 
wish to join in.

If you have any questions please call Susan (59989) or Cyndie (31443).

Thanks!!
Cyndie

Subject: new EEI negative confirms

Brenna, Leslie and Team:
Just to let you know, the counterparties we have an EEI agreement with and we 
send negative confirms to have the same look as if it was a regular 
confimation letter, but without signature places.  For instance Reliant 
Energy (Deal 479858.01) negative confirm, looks just like a regular 
confirmation letter, the number is in the upper right hand corner as well.  
You all can just file the negative confirmations like usual, and execute the 
Enron Confirmations that have two signatures.  Please call with any 
questions.

	"Proof of Life" opens around the country Friday and it had better be good 
because if it's not, it will only live in infamy as "That Movie Where, During 
Filming, Meg Ryan Cheated On Dennis Quaid With Russell Crowe" - and nobody 
wants that. The film's official Web site is cool stuff, highlighting all the 
things about kidnapping and ransom you never thought you'd need to know. It's 
actually a little harrowing, with statistics in red typeface flying across 
the screen like CNN coverage during wartime. Click on individual countries to 
learn about their "K&R" history, and then swing over to the typical goodies 
like trailer, soundtrack info, cast & crew, etc. Good-looking site for a 
movie starring a good-looking couple - just don't think about that part, 
though. www.proofoflife.com

Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat

I have recently learned that using the IPTV viewer and downloading music from 
the internet can possibly interfere with other applications that you may be 
working in.  Please do not use IPTV viewer or download music from your PC 
while at work.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

> RARE FORM OF BREAST CANCER
> In November, I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer.  She
> developed a rash on her breast, similar to that of young mothers who are
> nursing. Because her mammogram had been clear, the doctor treated her with
> antibiotics for infections. After 2 rounds and it continued to get worse,
> her doctor sent her for another mammogram, and this time it showed a mass.
> A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy. Chemo was started in order to
> shrink the growth; then mastectomy; then a full round of chemo; then
> radiation.  After about 9 months of intense treatment, she was given a
> clean bill of health. One year of living each day to its fullest - then it
> returned to the liver area. She took 4 treatments and decided that she
> wanted quality of life, not the after effects of chemo. We had 5 great

> Paget's Disease
> This is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast,
> on the nipple and aureola. It appeared as a rash, which later became a
> lesion with a crusty outer edge. I would not have ever suspected it to be
> breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seemed any different to me,
> butthe rash bothered me, so I went to the doctor for that. Sometimes, it
> itched and was sore, but other than that it didn't bother me. It was just
> ugly and a nuisance, and could not be cleared up with all the creams
> prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes
> just prior to this outbreak. They seemed a little concerned but did not
> warn me it could be cancerous. Now I suspect there are not many women out
> there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast
> cancer. Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola. One of the
> biggest problems with Paget's disease of the nipple is that the symptoms
> appear to be harmless.  It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation
> or infection, leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care.
> What are the symptoms? The symptoms include:
> 1. A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it
> to itch and burn. (As I stated, mine did not itch or burn much, and had no
> oozing I was aware of, but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one
> side).
> 2. A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the aureola
> area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple).
> 3. Usually only one nipple is affected.
>
> How is it diagnosed?
> Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram
> of both breasts, done immediately. Even though the redness, oozing and
> crusting closely resemble dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), your
> doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast. Your
> doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on.
> They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for
> cancer. If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your
> doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or
> suggest radiation treatments. Had my doctor caught mine right away,
> instead of flaking it off as dermatitis, perhaps they could have saved my
> breast, and it wouldn't have gone to my lymph nodes.
> This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your
> friends as possible; it could save someone's life. My breast cancer has
> spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of
> chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. If this had
> been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning, perhaps it would not
> have spread...
> TO ALL READERS- This is sad as women are not aware of Paget's disease. If,
> by passing this around on the e-mail, we can make others aware of it, and
> its potential danger, we are helping women everywhere. Please, if you can,
> take a moment to forward this message to as many people as possible,

M Deal #333292 A&B was sent to the file room to be faxed to the counterparty. 
After being faxed we are to track as sent to counterparty. This deal is not 
in the Tagg system. I  called and informed Ana Rizvi on this matter this 
morning. I checked Tagg again and this deal has not been entered at this 
time.

Hello Everyone,

I will be coordinating with IT to ensure our migration to Outlook 2000 (GEM 
Project) happens smoothly and successfully.  I will inform you of information 
needed or timelines as I am made aware of them.  I'm in the process of 
providing them the initial information for our group.  After they receive it 
they will send me more details of how the process will take place and how 
long it will take to complete.  Please hold your questions until you receive 
that email.  If you have something you would like to address after you 
receive that e mail we will proceed as needed.

The first step for you, is to go through your lotus notes and start wiping 
out personal e mails and data that can be converted to a spreadsheet or word 
document.  We will have access to our lotus notes for a period of time (will 
have to get specifics from IT) but will not be sending or receiving e mails 
through the Lotus Notes Database once we have migrated over. 

Again, I will keep you posted as I receive information.  Thank you for your 
patience and cooperation in advance.

Julissa

	Remember the Magic 8 Ball from your youth? Well, in keeping with the 
tradition of the rest of our lives being digitized in Web-chunks, you can now 
have a Magic 8 Ball shaken just for you on the Web. That's right - ask it a 
question and the 8 Ball shakes itself up and reflects an answer to you via a 
Webcam. The use of the Webcam and a bunch of other techno-babble is explained 
in excrutiating detail at the site but will make your head explode if you try 
and read it. Trust me - just stick to the questions. 8ball.federated.com

	At The Coma
	The woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several 
months, yet she had stayed by his bedside every single day. One day, when he 
came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. 
	
	As she sat by him, he whispered, eyes full of tears, "You know what? You have 
been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to 
support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you 
were by my side. When we lost the house, you stayed right here. When my 
health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?" 
	
	"What dear?" She gently asked, smiling as her heart began to fill with 
warmth. 
	
	"I think you're bad luck."

SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 
off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and 
SCEG will be on the bid.       

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5



FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.      
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7

HI,
Happy Sabbath!!!  May you be very blessed.

> The One Minute Prayer

>Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this right now.  I am
> asking
> You to minister to their spirit at this very moment.   Where there is
> pain,
> give them Your peace and mercy.  Where there is self doubting, release
a
> renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them.  Where there
is
> tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
guidance,
>
> and strength as they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
> spiritual stagnation, I ask You to renew them by revealing Your
nearness,
>
> and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You.  Where there is
fear,
>
> reveal Your love, and release to them Your courage.  Where there is a
sin
>
> blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over my friend's life.
> Bless
> their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders and
> friends
> to support and encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to

> the evil forces around them, and reveal to them the power they have in
> You
> to defeat it.
>

> >> From a woman who works in a police department:
> >>
> >>
> >>    I have to share some things I have learned in my job
> >>    with you.
> >>
> >>    In my job, I review criminal and psychiatric files of
> >>    imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their
> >>    release date.  I decide if they are likely to re-offend
> >>    based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them
> >>    to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that
> >>    they are at significant risk to re-offend
> >>
> >>    I have read hundreds and hundreds of files, and have
> >>    taken note of some of the mistakes women make.  Let me
> >>    preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER
> >>    at fault for being raped or attacked, but there are
> >>    definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim.
> >>
> >>    Here are the most common mistakes women make that
> >>    could result in them getting kidnapped, attacked,
> >>    and/or raped:
> >>
> >>    1.  Getting into the attacker's car when he pulls a
> >>    gun and orders you to get into his vehicle.
> >>
> >>    Most attackers don't want to shoot you ... they want
> >>    you to get into the car so that they can drive you to
> >>    a deserted place and torture you.  Don't comply.  Run
> >>    screaming.  It is MUCH more likely than not that he
> >>    will just move on to an easier target.
> >>
> >>    2.  Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you
> >>    pointing at your car pretending something is wrong.
> >>
> >>    If this happens, drive to the nearest well-lit and
> >>    populated gas station and look the car over yourself
> >>    (or ask an attendant).  Never pull over.  Believe it
> >>    or not, many women have fallen for this for fear of
> >>    their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the
> >>    road.  Not likely.
> >>
> >>    3.  Not locking your doors while driving.
> >>
> >>    I have read several cases where the attacker simply
> >>    walks up to a woman's car while she's at a traffic
> >>    light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn.
> >>
> >>    4.  Opening your front door when you have not
> >>    positively identified who is there.
> >>
> >>    If you don't have a peep hole, get one.  I've seen
> >>    countless cases where the attacker gains access to his
> >>    victims simply by knocking on their door.
> >>
> >>    Don't let an attacker get into your home.  He then has
> >>    a private, relatively soundproof place to attack you.
> >>
> >>    5.  Not being alert in parking lots.
> >>
> >>    If you go to the grocery store at night, don't be shy
> >>    about asking for an escort to your car.  Too many
> >>    women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in
> >>    the parking lot.
> >>
> >>    Look in your back seat before entering your car.  Cars
> >>    provide endless hiding places for attackers, both
> >>    inside them and in between them.
> >>
> >>    Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left
> >>    and right and behind you with your head up all the
> >>    time.  You may appear paranoid and look funny to
> >>    others, but an attacker will think twice about
> >>    approaching someone who appears so aware of what's
> >>    going on.
> >>
> >>    6.  Trusting a clean cut, honest looking stranger.
> >>
> >>    I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of
> >>    Florida.  They do not look like monsters.  They often
> >>    look like they could be your friendly grocer, bank
> >>    teller, waiter, neighbor, clergy, doctor, etc.  They
> >>    are every age between 15 and 90, and probably beyond.
> >>    Only a small minority actually look scary.
> >>
> >>    I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one
> >>    leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he
> >>    raped her.  Who would have ever thought that a
> >>    one-legged man could be a rapist?
> >>
> >> 7.  Trusting people to be alone with your children.
> >>
> >> This is a difficult one, because child molesters end
> >> up being the LAST person the parents would believe is
> >> the molester.
> >>
> >> Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the
> >> stepfather, the uncle, the sister's boyfriend, the
> >> mother's boyfriend, the grandfather, the baby-sitter,
> >> the neighbor, the family friend, the youth camp
> >> director, day care worker, etc.  Although rare, even
> >> women can be molesters.
> >>
> >> In every case, the perpetrator is a nice guy,
> >> trusting, good with children, and the family is
> >> baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be
> >> abusing their child.
> >>
> >> When it comes to your children and grandchildren, be
> >> suspicious of everyone, no matter who they are.  And
> >> pay attention to what your child says and how he/she
> >> reacts to the mention of different people in their
> >> lives.
> >>
> >> I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this,

I don't see what the confusion is all about

We now live in a country where I have no President but I do have ...

1) a dead Senator from Missouri going to Congress.
2) a fake President played on TV by Martin Sheen.
3) a new Senator from New York who used to be the wife of the boss
of the man who may be President.
4) a Governor from Florida who is the brother of the man who may be
President and son of a man who was.
5) a sitting President whose wife now will be hanging around the same
men who voted to remove him from office.
6) a senior Senator from South Carolina who, under our current
Constitution rules, could be appointed to be President in this standoff
despite the fact that he is 98.
7) a potential Vice President who, because he did not take his name
off the Connecticut Senate race, could end up being the deciding
factor in how the Senate is composed.

And finally ....
8) A state where a Republican Secretary of State and a Democratic
Attorney General try to determine the outcome of 25 electoral votes
without appearing to be partisan.

Any questions? Frankly, I don't see what the confusion is all about!

Hi,  until Joe tells me otherwise, he needs to see all deals done with the 
Counterparty 'Enterprise Products Operating L.P.' if the counterparty 
signature has a stamp above it that says "By Enterprise Products GP, LLC, 
General Partner".  I will send around a copy tomorrow so that you can see an 
example of what I am talking about. 

I still do not have the list typed up from our meeting, but I will get the 
information to you as soon as I can!!

Thanks,
Brenna

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria


 Friend



When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

Cool Site of the Day

 


The ancient Chinese art of origami (which literally means "to fold paper") is 
remarkably documented at Joseph Wu's Origami Page. And whether you're a 
seasoned pro or have never heard the term until now, you've got to check this 
site out. For the uninitiated, there are many galleries to roam around that 
contain some of the wildest paperfolding you will surely ever see - check out 
Wu's own paper microscope for proof. You will also find the history of the 
art, links to origami sites across the entire Web, instructions on how to 
learn the art, supply information, and plenty of diagrams on how to perfect 
some of the more popular folds. Old pros will find a community thriving here 
that will support even the most wild paper-folders out there. Get to it!

You Gotta Have Faith


There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.

One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her
Bible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After
awhile, he turned to her and asked, "You don't really believe all that stuf=
f
in there do you?"

The lady replied, "Of course I do. It is the Bible."
He said, "Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?"
She replied, "Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible."
He asked, "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?"

The lady said, "Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him."
"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.
"Then you can ask him." replied the lady.

InfoBeat Alerts - An Update from InfoBeat


*** An Update From InfoBeat

Dear Valued InfoBeat Subscriber:

We sincerely apologize for any service disruption or inconvenience
you may have experienced recently with your InfoBeat service.
Over the past few months, we have been making important upgrades
to many parts of our publishing system.  Unfortunately, the final
set of upgrades, which we have been working on over the past few
weeks, has caused some unanticipated disruptions to the InfoBeat 
service.

The InfoBeat engineering team worked around the clock this past
Thanksgiving weekend to implement changes that will prevent such 
situations from occurring in the future.  We very much appreciate 
your continued patience as we make some final enhancements which, 
when completed, will result in an InfoBeat service that is better 
than ever.

Thank you for your continued support which has helped InfoBeat grow 
to be a service with over 8 million subscribers, each receiving 
personalized news every day.  We greatly appreciate your patience 
as we finish our upgrades that will make InfoBeat even better for 
every one of you.  

If you have any questions or comments, please visit our Feedback 
page at www.infobeat.com, or email us at feedback@infobeat.com.

Sincerely,


Mark Wachen
CEO, Indimi/General Manager, InfoBeat

Hi Juan

Per my previous e:mail below we have now assigned you your second requested 
intern (per Kevin Presto's earlier request to John Lavorato).    These Inters 
were on Kevin  Presto's actual selection of candidates for his world.   Their 
names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

Joseph Spector    Start date:   June 4th
Andrew Kandolha  Start date:  May 21st

The A&A Program will be in contact with your assistant to set up appropriate 
systems etc.

=09=09
=09=09Readers wrote in saying they thought attaching WAVs to e-mail was a g=

folder, which you can name "My Sounds" or "WAV Files" or "Funny Noises."=20
Create the appropriate folder, and then save the sound file in it. To do=20
that, go to the Web page, click on the file you want to save, and choose=20
"Save this file to disk." Navigate to your sound folder and click "save."=

When you're ready to attach it to an e-mail, open a new message and, in=20
Outlook, choose Insert-File (or click the paper clip icon). In Netscape the=
=20
attach button and the paper clip icon are on the same button -- other e-mai=

with all your sounds in it, and click the one you want to add. You can't ma=

>    THE EMPTY CHAIR
>
>    A man's daughter had asked the local minister
>    to come and pray with her   father.  When
>    the minister arrived, he found  the man lying in
>    bed with  his head propped up on two pillows.
>   An empty chair sat beside his bed.
>   The minister assumed that the old fellow had
>   been informed of his visit..
>   "I  guess you were expecting me," he said.
>   "No, who are you?" said the father.
>   The minister told him his name and then
>    remarked, "I see the empty  chair; I  figured
>    you knew I was going to  show up."
>   "Oh yeah, the chair," said  the  bedridden
>   man. "Would you mind closing the door?"
>   Puzzled, the minister  shut the door.
>  "I have never told anyone this, not even my
>  daughter," said  the man.
>  "But all of my life I have never  known how
>   to pray. At church I used to
>  hear the pastor talk about prayer,  but it
>  went right over my head." "I  abandoned any
>  attempt at prayer," the old man continued,
>  "until one day about four years ago my
>  best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just
>   a simple matter of having a conversation with
>  Jesus.
>  Here is what I suggest." "Sit down in a
>  chair; place an empty chair in  front of you,
>  and in faith see Jesus on the  chair. It's not
>  spooky because he promised, "I'll be with you
>  always." Then just speak to him in the same
>  way you're doing with me right now."
>  "So, I tried it and I've liked it so much that
>  I do it a couple of hours every day. I'm careful
>  though. If  my  daughter saw me talking to an
>  empty  chair, she'd  either have a nervous
>  breakdown or send me off to the funny farm."
>   The minister was deeply moved by the story and
>   encouraged the old man to continue on the journey.
>   Then he prayed with him, anointed him with oil,
>   and returned to the church.
>   Two nights later the daughter called to tell the
>   minister that her daddy had died that afternoon.
>   "Did he die in peace?" he asked.  "Yes, when I
>   left the house about two o'clock, he  called me
>  over to his bedside,  told me he loved me and
>  kissed me on the cheek. When I got  back from
>  the store an hour later, I found him dead. "But
> there was something strange about his death.
> Apparently, just before Daddy died, he leaned
> over and rested his head on the chair beside
> the bed. What do you make of  that?"
> The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said, "I wish
> we could all go like that."
>
>  Just  send this to four people and do not  break this,
>   please. Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive.
>   There is no cost but a lot of rewards.

First Christmas in Heaven
http://www.daily-blessings.com/ch48.htm


I found a really neat site that I hope you'll all check out.  With the 
holidays coming up it has a great idea for that person you don't know what to 
get...but someone you think is the greatest.  It's called Unsung Hero and I

Subject: Grace that is Sufficient

 Subject: Empty Bird Cage
 
 There once was a man named George Thomas, a pastor in a small New
 England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to Church carrying a
 rusty,bent,old bird cage and set it by the pulpit.  Several eyebrows were
 raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak...
 "I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy
 coming  toward me swinging this birdcage. On the bottom of the cage were 
three
 little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and
 asked, 'What you got there, son?'"
 "Just some old birds", came the reply.
 "What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.
 "Take 'em home and have fun with 'em," he answered. "I'm gonna
 tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a
 real good time." "But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What
 will you do?"
 "Oh, I got some cats," said the boy -- "They like birds. I'll
  take'em to them."
  The Pastor was silent for a moment. "How much do you want
  for the birds, son?"
  "Huh??!!!   Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just
  plain old field birds. They don't sing -- they ain't even pretty!"
 "How much?" the pastor asked again.
  The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10,"
  The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten-dollar bill.
  He placed it in the boys hand. In a flash, the boy was gone.
  The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of
  the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage
  down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars he persuaded 
birds                       out, setting them free.
 
 Well, that explained the empty birdcage on the pulpit, and then
 the pastor began to tell this story....
 One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just
 come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.
 "Yes sir, I just caught the world full of people down there.  Set
 me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!!"
 "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.
 
 Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun. I'm gonna teach them how
 to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to
 drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs
 and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!!"
 And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked.
 "Oh I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.
 "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.
 Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll
 take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill
 you!!   
 You don't want those people".
 "How much??" Jesus asked again.
 Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your
 blood."
 Jesus said, 'DONE." Then he paid the price.
 The pastor picked up the cage, opened the door and walked from the
 pulpit.

Subject: checkout for 5/3 hourly deals

Guys,

I know this is getting to the point of nagging, but the day guys are doing a 
BAD job of getting there stuff in the P&L and Enpower.  We are having to 
spend too much time going back and researching tags and comparing enpower to 
P&L and vice versa before we can even begin to checkout.  I spent two hours 
having to go through many deals (in both books) to figure out what happened 
before we could begin checkouts.  I understand some human errors occur - 
that's why we do checkout's but much of this I feel is just laziness and guys 
not paying attention.  Can you guys address this and try to implement some 
steps to help correct this.  With the lack of bodies on the night shift, this 
is causing problems.

Thanks,
Doug

It's beginning to get embarrassing how many things are out there ridiculing
this now everpresent election.    But way too many of them are too funny to
keep to oneself ...........

(by "Phil")

Can we count them with our nose?
Can we count them with our toes?
Should we count them with a band?
Should we count them all by hand?
If I do not like the count,
I will simply throw them out!

I will not let this vote count stand
I do not like them, AL GORE I am!

Can we change these numbers here?
Can we change them, calm my fears?
What do you mean, Dubya has won?
This is not fair, this is not fun
Lets count them upside down this time
Lets count until the state is mine!

I will not let this VOTE count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

I'm really ticked, I'm in a snit!
You have not heard the last of it!
I'll count the ballots one by one
And hold each one up to the sun!
I'll count, recount, and count some more!
You'll grow to hate this little chore

But I will not, cannot let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, Al Gore I am!

I won't leave office, I'm stayin' here!
I've glued my desk chair to my rear!
Tipper, Hillary, and Bubba too,
all telling me that I should sue!
We find the Electoral College vile!
RECOUNT the votes until I smile!

We do not want this vote to stand!
We do not like it, AL GORE I am!

How shall we count this ballot box?
Let's count it standing in our socks!
Shall we count this one in a tree?
And who shall count it, you or me?
We cannot, cannot count enough!
We must not stop, we must be tough!

I do not want this vote to stand!
I do not like it AL GORE I am!

I've counted till my fingers bleed!
And still can't fulfill my counting need!
I'll count the tiles on the floor!
I'll count, and count, and count some more!
And I will not say that I am done!
Until the counting says I've won!

I will not let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

What's that? What? What are you trying to say?
You think the current count should stay?
You do not like my counting scheme?
It makes you tense, gives you bad dreams?
Foolish people, you're wrong you'll see!
You're only care should be for me!

I WILL NOT LET THIS VOTE COUNT STAND!
I DO NOT LIKE IT. AND AL GORE I AM!

 <<REASON_.doc>>    I thought this was a sweet little verse but that last
paragraph about sending it to 100,000 of your nearest and dearest just ruins
it.  Then I bbc'd to lots and lots of you so no one would know who was
getting it from me.  If you start getting duplicates, well, at least I
tried.  It prints out really nice on a color printer.  Let me know if you
need a copy.

Hi,
Here's the latest on the Lincoln twins.  We need to buy the magazine he
talks about at the bottom -- dad talked to him this week on the telephone.
Seems that things are going well.

> > > > > 11 at night until seven in the morning. She paid 65

> > > > > arrive with her pajamas on and the kids would already
> > > > > be asleep. This seemed like a good arrangement to her,
> > > > > so we made
> > > > > deal. That night when the little ones and I knelt to

> > > > > home in the mornings I woke the baby-sitter up and
> > > > > sent her home with one dollar of my tip money-fully

> > > > > penny balloons and began to leak. I had to fill them

> > > > > too.  I was sewing patches on top of patches on the
> > > > > boys pants and soon they would be too far gone to

> > > > > named Joe.  A few musicians were hanging around after

> > > > > it was hard to tell what. When I reached he car I

> > > > > jaw
> > > > > dropped in amazement.  My old battered Chevy was
> > > > > filled full to the top with boxes of all shapes and
> > > > > sizes. I quickly opened the driver's side door,
> > > > > scrambled inside and kneeled in the front facing the
> > > > > back seat. Reaching back,I pulled off the lid of the
> > > > > top box. Inside was a whole case of little blue jeans,

Subject: He's Crazy About You!


If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it.
If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it.
He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning.
Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen.
He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your heart.
What about the Christmas gift He sent you in Bethlehem; not to
mention that Friday at Calvary.
Face it, friend. He's crazy about you.

______________________________________________
Let's not forget.

Love Ya!

Hi!  I just thought I would give an update on Stacey.  She is doing 
great!!!!!!!!  She finally got to eat solids today!  Yes, she still has her 
trachea in, but when she is capped, she can eat and talk.  And believe me, 
she is making up for lost time with both of those.  She was so happy to eat 
today.  She had some finely chopped chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 
macaroni and cheese.  She was elated!  It was really fun to watch her.  She 
is feeding herself but only with her left hand.  Her right arm is still 
messed up.  The bone has come loose from the socket at the shoulder and the 
muscles have stretched.   They are working on trying to get it back in 
shape.  She can move it sometimes, but is in pain almost all the time.  She 
is cussing and discussing many things.  She has decided that it is time to go 
home and gets pretty upset when she is told no (so what else is new?).  She 
will be going to the opthomologist next week - to his office.  I am so 
excited that she will actually get to go somewhere.  We will go in the 
hospital van so they can help with her wheelchair.  She is still seeing 
double in her left eye at times.  She said she was seeing two mommies today.  
I asked her if one of them was skinny.  She said "No".  I said "then both are 
fat?".  She said, "They aren't fat, they're just overweight".  She teases a 
lot and remembers most of what we ask.  Her short term memory isn't very 
good.  She has trouble remembering the nurses names but reads their name tag 
instead.  Yes, she can read some things but not everything.  Some names and 
words throw her off.  She doesn't remember the accident.  The doctor said she 
wouldn't remember the accident and probably wouldn't remember one to two 
months prior to the accident.  She is still having trouble remembering what 
month it is but can remember that it is the year 2000.  I bought her a cheap 
watch today and she is able to tell the time most of the time.  Her progress 
is wonderful and I am so excited watching her.  We don't think we'll be home 
for Christmas, but think it will be some time in January.  We are planning to 
have Christmas at the hospital.  I told her it doesn't matter where, just 
that we are together; she seem okay with that.
Well, I need to go to bed.  A chance to sleep on my own bed is a luxury.  I 
miss John beside me.  He is going to Corpus on Mon. and Wed. night when I am 
coming home.  We pass on the freeway and call each other on the phone.  One 
time we stopped at the same Exxon to get gas and necked at the gas pumps.  
I'm sure people were wondering about us.  I get to see him on the weekends, 
but I miss spending time with him and David.  Sharon is coming home on her 
days off and spending as much time with Stacey as she can.  She will be here 
over the Christmas and New Year holidays.  She is thinking about moving back 
home to be closer to Stacey but isn't sure about it yet.  
Please,  send me your phone number and address.  We can't find our address 
book and I stupidly erased everything in my mailbox last week.  My brain is 
turning into mush.
Hope to hear from you soon.  My love to all.  I miss you and love you much!
Carolyn

Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and

The conference room 37c1 is booked at 11:00 - and I believe Julissa plans to 
have extra tables available to set up our dishes.
 
Please see Julissa in 37c1 between 11:00 and 11:30 so she can tell us  how 
she'd like items arranged.

 In the meantime - please keep at your desk unless you need to put in a 
refrigerator on your floor.

The room is booked  (until 3pm), so we'll have plenty of time for going back 
for seconds, and for clean up.

Hope that answers most questions.   Thanks....Sandy

Subject: Love Ya!

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!

Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to send you this Stacey report. I was down 
in Corpus this past Tuesday and Wednesday and then up to Huntsville for 
Thanksgiving with my folks, and just returned home this afternoon (Saturday).
 
Stacey is OUT of the comma!!!!!!! She emerged from it last Sunday. Needless 
to say, Carolyn and John are just beside themselves. While I was with them on 
Wed. morning, I was able to watch Stacey in her rehab and got to see her 
write her name with her left hand. She also, just before I arrived, said 
"Momma".  Guess What? I have really seem firsthand the miracle that we have 
all been praying for. 
 
I must admit that I was somewhat teary-eyed watching this precious little 
girl do things that no one was sure that she would ever do again.  But, there 
is still a long way to go.
 
Stacey's right arm is just kind of hanging from muscle atrophy. And, it is 
giving her a lot of pain. (The good thing is that now she can tell the 
doctors where the pain is located!) Also, it is going to take several more 
months of rehab before she can go home. So, keep the prayers going.
 
As I entered the room, there was a man there who was leaving. Last December, 
he was in an accident that left him in the same shape as Stacey. But now, he 
is fully recovered. He came to the hospital because he had seen an article in 
the Corpus Christi newspaper about Stacey. He said that he felt that he just 
needed to let the family know that there really is hope and that you really 
can fully recover. WOW! Does God have a sense of timing or what?
 
Carolyn wants everyone to know how much she loves you all and appreciates 
your concern and your prayers. The hospital let them use a large room for 
Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were even going to let Stacey have some of the 
food with them. Talk about a Thanksgiving?
 
Folks, I must tell you that this has been exciting for me to see this miracle 
unfold. I have enjoyed hearing from Carolyn and being able to report these 
things to all of you. I wish that all of you could get to go and see these 
people that we have all prayed for these past few months. It has been quite 
an emotional deal for me to have seen a child that no one was sure would even 
live and now see her awake and recognizing people around her and laughing and 
crying and writing her name. Thanks for what you have done for her through 
your prayers. And thanks for allowing me to send you these updates and to be 
your eyes and ears. But, as I said earlier, we don't stop here. It's not over 
until Stacey is 100%, and she will be! I will stay in touch with Carolyn and 
keep you updated.
 
We do have much to be thankful for this year.  So, let's thank Him who is the 
giver of all the good and perfect gifts, even life itself!
 
Be Blessed!
Kent

Hi,
This gives you some food for thought -- think before you react.
Love ya!
Barb

A Box Full of Kisses


The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year old daughter
for
wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
infuriated
when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
Never
the less, the little girl brought the box to her father the next morning
and
said, "This is for you Daddy". He was embarrassed by his earlier over
reaction,
but his temper flared again when he found that the box was empty. He
yelled at
her, " Don't you know when you give someone a present, there's supposed
to be
something inside it". The little girl looked at him with tears in her
eyes and
said, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty, I blew Kisses into the box. All for
you,
Daddy" The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and
begged
for her forgiveness. An accident took the life of the child only a short
time
later and it is told that man kept that gold box by his bed for many
years and
whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and
remember
the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of
us, as
humans, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love
and
kisses from our children, friends, family or God. There is no more
precious
possession anyone can hold.

Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble
remembering how to fly.

Attached is everything that you would want to know about our customer outing
this week.  If anyone has any problems with hotel rooms or anything else,
let me know.  Those of you that are coming in on Thursday, please make sure
that you have told the Sheraton on Highway 280 so they will hold your room
for Thursday night.  Please pass this information along to your co-workers
that are coming because I did not have everyone's e-mail.  The golf course
is over an hour away from the golf course that we are playing at so allow
plenty of time to return for those of you that are returning home Thursday
evening.  We will understand if you have to leave early but we should be
O.K.

Subject: Re: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the "source" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to Enron as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  Enron (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, Enron must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/practices.html

Questions may be e-mailed to Tom White at the MAPP Center:
ts.white@mapp.org

Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the URL given above.

A copy of the revised section five of the policies and procedures document
is attached.

Subject: Love Ya!

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!

Subject: John 3:16



In the city of Chicago, one cold, dark night, a blizzard was setting in.
A
little boy was selling newspapers on the corner, the people were in and
out of
the cold. The little boy was so cold that he wasn't trying to sell many
papers. He walked up to a policeman and said,

"Mister, you wouldn't happen to know where a poor boy could find a warm
place to
sleep tonight would you?  You see, I sleep in a box up around the corner
there and down the alley and it's awful cold in there at night. Sure would be
nice to have a warm place to stay."

The policeman looked down at the little boy and said, "You go down the
street to that big white house and you knock on the door. When they come
out the door you just say John 3:16 and they will let you in."

So he did, he walked up the steps to the door, and knocked on the door
and a lady answered.  He looked up and said, "John 3:16."

The lady said "Come on in, Son." She took him in and she sat him down in
a split bottom rocker in front of a great big old fireplace and she went off.

He sat there for a while, and thought to himself "John 3:16....  I don't
understand it, but it sure makes a cold boy warm."

Later she came back and asked him "Are you hungry?" He said, "Well, just
a little. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and I guess I could stand a
little bit of food."

The lady took him in the kitchen and sat him down to a table full of
wonderful food. He ate and ate until he couldn't eat any more. Then he
thought to himself "John 3:16... Boy, I sure don't understand it, but it
sure makes a hungry boy full."

She took him upstairs to a bathroom to a huge bathtub filled with warm
water and he sat there and soaked for a while. As he soaked, he thought
to himself, "John 3:16... I sure don't understand it, but it sure makes a
dirty boy
clean. You know, I've not had a bath, a real bath, in my whole life.  The
only
bath I ever had was when I stood in front of that big old fire hydrant as
they flushed it out."

The lady came in and got him, and took him to a room and tucked him into
a big
old feather bed and pulled the covers up around his neck and kissed him
goodnight and turned out the lights. As he laid in the darkness and
looked out
the window at the snow coming down on that cold night he thought to
himself,
"John 3:16... I don't understand it, but it sure makes a tired boy rested."

The next morning she came back up and took him down again to that same
big table full of food. After he ate she took him back to that same big
old split bottom rocker in front of the fireplace and she took a big old
Bible and
sat down in front of him and she looked up at and she asked, "Do you
understand John 3:16?"

He said, "No, Ma'am, I don't. The first time I ever heard it was last
night when the policeman told me to use it."

She opened the Bible to John 3:16 , and she began to explain to him
about Jesus. Right there in front of that big old fireplace he gave his
heart
and life to Jesus. He sat there and thought, "John 3:16. I don't
understand it, but it but it sure makes a lost boy feel safe."

You know, I have to confess I don't understand it either, how God would
be willing to send His Son to die for me, and how Jesus would agree to do
such a
thing. I don't understand it either, but it sure does make life worth living..

Author Unknown

John 3:16
16.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life..

17.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be saved.

18.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
only
begotten Son of God.

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

The Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team
was playing Satan's team, The Lord's team was at bat, the
score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the ninth inning
with two outs.

They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate
whose name was Love. Love swung at the 1st pitch and hit a single,
because Love never fails.

The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single
because Faith works with Love.

The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up
and threw the first pitch. Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it
ass.

Ball one.  Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because
Godly Wisdom never swings at what Satan throws.

The bases are loaded. The Lord then turns to Bob and told
him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to bat
stepped Grace.

Bob said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"  Satan's whole team
relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan
wound up and fired his first pitch.  To the shock of everyone,
Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen.

But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few
get by.  He went up for the ball, but it went right through
his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing to the
ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!

The Lord's team won. The Lord then asked Bob if he knew why Love,
Faith and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the
game.  Bob answered that he did not know why. The Lord explained,
"If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game you would think you
had done it by yourself.  Love, faith and wisdom will get you on
base, but only MY Grace can get you home.

"My Grace is the only thing Satan cannot steal."
