Kim-
Here is the August spreadsheet.  These are the changes I've made so far:

I changed the formula in column R
I added in the new contracts for August

The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);

It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit.

Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for.  It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense.

I know this is a lot of stuff to look at.  If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say.
Thanks,
Mara

Thanks Kim.  It would be great if you could see these to me daily.  I use
the information for two purposes: 1) to run our portfolio VaR and
Mark-to-market numbers, and 2) to have an indication of where the market is
going.

Our attorney has contacted me to let me know that he is reviewing the
Enfolio.

Monica,

Attached are some VERY rough prices for 1,2,3 and 5 years out at Malin and
City Gate.   I am still working on access to the programs for options as
well as more ACCURATE prices.  I know you are just trying to get a feel for
what the market looks like right now so this should be good for that.

Also, it looks like we don't have a master agreement in place with NCPA
which would govern gas transactions.  Those transactions would be done
under the General Terms & Conditions as well.  Did you get a copy of those?
I am following up on getting you a Master Agreement as well as an ISDA and
will keep you posted.

Call me if you have questions or need more info!!

Thanks,

Kim

Chris,
 Kim Ward asked me to forward this draft of the proposed Enfolio contract to 
you so that you could give it to her.  She said that she would send it to the 
city for its review.  The draft contains certain blanks which the city's 
counsel needs to provide.  Please call if you have any questions.

Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

Kim,

Again, to reiterate my changes, include the following general terms of your
offer in the LOU.
- Seller to provide all incremental gas needs up to 6,197 MMBtu/day at Malin
priced at bidweek flat and remaining incremental gas needs at PG&E citygate
bidweek flat.
- Seller to act as the Buyer's imbalance agent and provide such services as
nomination, scheduling and operations for all gas delivered to Buyer,
including gas purchased from a third party supplier.
- Seller to protect Buyer from daily price risk and penalties on EFO/OFO
events.
- Seller to provide in an electronic format daily price indications.

Also, I spoke to Karla about this and she too had some changes.  First,
change the term "demand" charge to volumetric charge, since demand charge is
commonly assessed on nominated not actual load.  And change the deadline to
June 30, 2001 (5 days can make a difference).

Thanks,

Monica

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on
the line next to
  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

1. Nov 01 - Mar 02, 2500 MMBtu/day @ CG for $11.86
2. Jul 03 - Jun 04, 2500 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.05
3. Nov 03-Mar04, 1000 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.13

I'll update you on the status of reaching our hedging goals soon.

Raveen, I'll get you the paperwork once I get it from Enron.

The monthly tolerance band is +/- 5%.  You can always find rules like this
on PG&E's website.  The relevant schedule for this particular question is
G-BAL.  I'm still trying to verify the actual usage question.  Will get back
to you soon.

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,"
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided

Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's

Thanks, Dan.  I've scanned and they look good to me, but I'll pass on to my
client for the final say-so.  I believe we can get this done fairly soon.
Grant.

  Grant,
       Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional
inquiries.
       7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to
read:  "(b) file a
  petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in
the commencement
  of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law
of the
  protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against
it and such
  proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a
petition is filed
  against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is
actively pursuing all
  steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the
other party with
  reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause
such proceeding to
  be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an
additional 30 Days to
  effectuate such dismissal,"
       8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days"
is acceptable.
       13.  I will change the definition of "Act" as you
suggest.
       21.  I propose that language be added whereby the
parties shall first
  attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of
binding
  Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not
resolve the issue
  to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall
thereafter be
  resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an
acceptable
  resolution?
       22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are
authorized to
  enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is
that whoever
  answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized
to bind the
  company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial
contact list of
  the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as
of the date
  the contract is signed; however, the persons who are
authorized to enter
  into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the
initial contact
  list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact
someone on the
  initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be
acceptable?

  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                     Dan.

Purchase/Sale Agreement






  Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was
out of town
  again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work
within 3 days.

  Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow
up with a couple
  of additional inquiries.

  7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated
in sentence 2.
  Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be
agreeable.

  8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

  13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11,
sections 5 and
  9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.
Section 3 is not
  regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my
knowledge,
  though
  I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

  21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not
recognized, if
  I
  have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in
which I've
  participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical
matter, it can
  cost
  almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed
to mediation,
  but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found
in arbitration.
  We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should
consider this
  approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would
not recommend to
  my client that we would proceed any further once the
mediator makes a
  proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of
arbitration is not
  worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer
mediation to
  arbitration.

  22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we
assemble some list.
  Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be
initially approved
  to
  engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.
We've had an
  unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
  energy company regarding the scope of its representative's
authority.  We
  don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That
list would help
  It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back
out of the
  contract, because someone arguably didn't have the
authority.  There are a
  ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make
that claim.

  Thanks.  Grant.

Enron.doc
  >>
            (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

            Grant,
                 I have reviewed your requested changes and
have made
  the changes which
            do not require explanation or clarification.
Those changes
  are reflected
            in the above document.  Let me go over your list
of items:
                 1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
                 2.   I have left a blank for the date within
the month
  of March 2001
            when the contract would be executed by the City.
                 3.   I have changed the word "may" to
"shall".
                 4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
does not fit
  in a
            Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum
quantity that can
  be handled by
            a party at a particular point.  I do not think
their is an
  omission.
                 5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
                 6.   The procedue for how the Termination
Payment is
  determined is
            provided, if the City disagrees with the method
and values
  provided in the
            statement and is unable to convince the Company to
revise,
  the statement,
            then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.
At the
  point that a
            Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a
long drawn
  out period
            should not be necessary to attain closure.
                 7.   We need to limit the duration to 30
days,  neither
  party should
            be required to wait 60 days before it could
accelerate the
  other party's
            obligations under the Contract.  We might be able
to add
  language to extend
            the period if we had some documentation stating
the steps
  that a party was
            pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed
and the
  other party was
            otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
                 8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days
is too
  short a period.
            During a holiday period, one scheduling error
could cover
  the entire
            period.  Article 3 has language which provides a
remedy for
  a party if a
            scheduling default extends for more than 5 days
during any
  month.
                 9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the
rated
  entity and no
            separate rating applies to ENA.
                 10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
                 11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation
on the
  duration of an
            event of Force Majeure.
                 12.  This merely addressed the possibility of
a
  imbalance amount being
            due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using
multiple
  points, and the
            language would allocated the payment based on the
amount of
  the imbalance
            that a particular party may have caused.  I think
the
  language is clear as
            written.
                 13.  The definition of Act was one of the
items that I
  had requested
            that you review and complete as necessary so that
all
  appropriate statutes
            were referenced.  I am still waiting for your
language.  I
  started filling
            it in using language that had been provided by the
City.
                 14.  I added the word "reasonable".
                 15.  I have made the requested change
relating to
  GAAAP.
                 16.  This is a late payment provision and as
such a
  believe that the
            provision should be more than a party's rating, as
such I
  have kept the 2%
            over prime language.
                 17.  These amounts were determined by the
credit group
  and any change
            needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is
considered
  investment
            grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating
is BBB.
  ENA is not a
            rated entity and that is why the language relates
to Enron
  Corp.'s rating.
                 18.  The elimination of the opinion of
counsel did not
  change the
            requirements relating to the representations that
we expect
  the City to
            have made.  If the City cannot make these
representations,
  then we need to
            know that before we execute the Contract.
                 19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
                 20.  The party that has the Transport
Agreement with
  the Transporter
            should have the legal right to obtain the
information based
  on its
            contract.
                 21.  It is our position that any dispute be
arbitrated.
  We can agree
            to meditation if we can make the outcome binding
on the
  parties.  I am
            willing to discuss any changed language that you
might care
  to offer.
                 22.  We have found that personnel of both our
Company
  and that of our
            Customers change so rapidily that the list is not
workable
  and merely
            allows a party to back out of transactions it does
not like
  on the basis
            that the person who agreed to such transaction was
not on
  the list.
            Therefore , we object to any listing of approved
parties who
  can transact.
            We believe that each party should be responsible
for the
  actions of its
            employees and should stand behind any transactions
that
  those parties may
            enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of
the
  Contract.

                 I will be out of the office on Friday, but
will be in
  all next week if
            you care to discuss any of these matters.

  Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

  Purchase/Sale Agreement






             <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

            Dan:

            First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
  authorizes the City
            Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

            More importantly, I need to inform you that our
senior
  management has
            reviewed the referenced contract; I have been
asked to
  present additional
            changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration
and to
  raise questions
            about certain of its terms and conditions.

            Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and
proceed to the
  end of the
            exhibits.

            1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of
the Enfolio
  agreement
            which
            should be deleted.

            2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not
contain
  the words "1st
            of
            January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until
the parties
  have signed the
            contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach
as of the
  date it signs
            the
            contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires
the City
  to proffer the
            to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

            3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City
(Customer)
  wants Enron
            (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic
Transaction,
  as defined.
            Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should
be
  changed to "shall."

            4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first
sentence:
  Buyer's Requested
            Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's
failure to
  Schedule the
            Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default.
            How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
fit into a
  Seller's
            Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested
Quantity does
  not include a
            Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is
the reason
  for the
            omission?

            5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line
23 refers
  to "reasonable
            attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys'
fees."
  To be internally
            consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable
attorneys' fees."

            6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A
statement
  showing the
            determination of the Termination Payment will be
prepared.
  It's unclear
            whether the City is entitled to review and
challenge the
  determination
            before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The
City
  should be entitled
            to
            receive a copy of the determination and to
question it
  before it is
            obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please
clarify,
  or permit the
            City to exercise these rights.

            7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering
Event will
  exist if a
            bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.
Is this
  (under
            bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within
which one
  may seek
            dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer
to the 11
  USC section
            that
            backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

            8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30
days" to "5
  days."  The
            City
            is concerned with the number of days that Enron
may be
  permitted to fail to
            Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by
Enron.

            9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a
default by
  Enron Corp.
            (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's
default in
  this regard?
            Please explain.

            10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed
to refer
  to "the Company"
            ?

            11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the
force
  majeure provision
            as drafted.  It states that the parties must
perform even if
  a FM event
            (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties
from
  performing with the
            60-day period stated therein.  There is no such
limitation
  under California
            law in the absence of a contract provision to the
contrary.

            12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron
translate the last
  sentence?  We
            don't understand it.

            13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why
Section 3 is
  referred to?

            14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add
"reasonable"
  before
            "attorneys' fees.

             15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP
means
  generally accepted
            accounting principles, consistently applied, with
respect to
  Company, and
            governmental generally accepted accounting
principles,
  consistently
            applied,
            with respect to Customer."

            16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete
"two
  percent over".  The
            City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City
believes
  the 2% over prime
            should not apply to it.

            17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What
does Enron
  believe the
            City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million
threshold is
  mentioned.  Also,
            what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an
investment grade
  rating?

            18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we
have agreed
  that the
            opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps
and
  warranties are being
            deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties"
is
  nevertheless included
            in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted,
because the
  City has not
            undertaken a court search as is our custom and
practice
  whenever we issue
            an
            opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is
not ...
  Party."

            19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
  "reasonable" before
            "attorneys' fees."

            20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by
"to the
  extent it has a
            legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

            21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We
do not as a
  matter of
            legal
            policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate
disputes.
  Is Enron
            amenable to mediation?  This process is less
formal and less
  costly in my
            opinion.

            22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like
the
  Agreement to include
            a list of employees for Company and Customer who
are
  authorized to trade on
            behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be
added to
  this section to
            this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as
an
  Exhibit C.

            Thank you so much for considering these issues.
There are
  others which I
            hope to receive from staff next week and which I
will
  forward to you for
            response.

            Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be
out of
  town after today
            until Wednesday, March 7.

            Sincerely,

            Grant Kolling

Hi Kim,

Yes.  Does this forecast account for the meter that is out?  The load data I
sent you last week for June 01 and July 01 is wrong.  One of the meters is
out and reflects zero usage for those months.  I believe you guys have
historical June and July usage for 1997 through 2000.  Let me know if you
need additional data.

We had talked about getting a forecast from you for months and months into
the future.

Also, I will fax you the baseload quantities for the month September 2001
this afternoon.

Call me if you have any questions.

Monica

Folks,
          We have a problem with PG&E's natural gas meter #4, which is one
of the meters that records Palo Alto's hourly gas consumption. Looking at
historical data , it seems the problem started in early May 01 . Our
consumption at that meter dropped by approx 85% in May,  97% in Jun and 98%
in Jul, compared to the previous year. Our total metered consumption in
general has been lower this year for May(-22%), Jun(-11%) & Jul(-10%)
compared to last year.

    PG&E notified us of the problem last month and metioned that they were
going to take steps to fix it.I spoke with Frank Arroyo of PG&E regarding
back billing , when and how they
intend to fix the meter and below is his response.

Raveen

As we discussed the natural gas flow through Palo Alto Station #4, located
at Searsville and Oak Road, appears to be much less than the designed
minimum capacity of the PG&E meter.  The current registered usage has also
been much less recently than in the past.  Apparently there has been
modifications to your distribution system that may be causing less load due
to a redundant supply from a different meter station.  Our Engineering
Department will call the Palo Alto Engineering Department to discuss options
to potentially modify the current metering station.  Based on the noted
natural gas flow through the meter when the meter station was evaluated, it
does not appear that we will be pursuing any corrective billing activities.
Although, we must reserve the right to initiate corrective billing should
the situation dictate.

Please call me if you have questions or if I can be of any assistance.

Frank

Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our potential
natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and would
like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.

As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid daily
price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing market
warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in the
form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years of
daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information when
submitting your final proposal.

Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.

Regards,

Monica V. Padilla

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word "reasonable".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed "a" to "the"
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word "reasonable".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word "reasonable".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

Dan, thanks.  I will review the contract changes later today or tomorrow.
And thank you for the response on the resolution.  I've heard that this item
will be presented to the council for adoption on March 12.  That's the
earliest date.  I will coordinate with our staff on other matters that need
attending to get this done.  Thanks for your help.  Grant Kolling.

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Attached is a redlined Natural Gas Services Agreement with the revisions we discussed.  Also attached is the Transaction Agreement.  The term has been revised to reflect a Dec. 31, 2002 ending date.  Please review and if acceptable, we can prepare executables.  Call with any questions.

I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to 
trade in derivatives, but that the city council will vote on an authorizing 
resolution at an April meeting.

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks 
ago, but I have heard nothing back.  We are requiring a legal opinion on the 
same form that we require other municipals to give for financial trading.
