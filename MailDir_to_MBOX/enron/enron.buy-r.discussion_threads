Totally supportive  of candidate. I hope we can get her. Only issue was 
reluctance to move to Houston or London. That will hurt us eventually. Rick

Are your plans to stay on 28? We are doing some planning on office space. I 
have some people in 3 Allen that I would like to move over here but it is not 
a big issue. I had heard that you were moving. Tx Rick

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London. Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and mange the RAC activities which include credit and market 
risk and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market 
Risk activities. Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a 
new assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port 

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company. Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Karen- Wanted to say thanks for the gifts you gave me the other day for xmas. 
I know I often appear ungrateful but that's what happens when you have 2 
thousand things on your mind. The pen and leather "thing" for notes are 
great- I'll use both in my annual attempt to get organised. Rick

It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, 
manager in the Market Risk Group. Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 
and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service 
here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been 
announced. Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.

Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a 
real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. Andy had  a 
warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made 
him a real asset to the group. He will be missed.

I'll defer to you two on what of the following needs to be communicated on to 
others in Houston:

Ilkka - Nigel Sellens (EEL - HR) phoned to confirm Ilkka had been terminated 
this morning.  He faxed the letter given to Ilkka and effectively tied 
termination to "gross mis-conduct".  As expected, Ilkka disputes this.  Nigel 
left resignation on the table with Ilkka as an option which would involve 
tearing up the letter.  I mentioned to Nigel that I don't believe resignation 
should be an option given the circumstances.  I asked Nigel to get back with 
me on this if Ilkka wants to discuss this further.  

Moving Operations to London - This morning I checked with Nigel, Kevin 
Sweeney (Acctg.) and Graham Cane (Logistics) to assure that they are 
preparing for the possibility that all operations are moved to London.  I 
went  ahead and made the calls to assure that all were prepared so that we 
don't lose 2 ~ 3 days if it is agreed later this week that this is the best 
course of action.  As one alternative, Olga K (in CRM) may need to be 
involved with rail movements due to the need to have a Russian speaker for 
communicating with Russian border authorities for rail deliveries if no one 
in Helsinki will move to London for the near term.  You'll note from prior 
e-mails that business is still being conducted from Helsinki so further 
communication on this point is clearly necessary since this is in conflict 
with the wishes of those in last night's conference call.  

Status of Audit - I spoke with Graham Cane (London Logistics) who is in 
Helsinki going over documentation with AA.  He now believes B/L's have been 
"adjusted".  Typically there is one stamped - Original - B/L and numerous 
stamped - Non-Negotiable - copies of the B/L.  It appears that in some 
instances vessel stamps and the master signature have been cut off of 
originals and glued on to altered copies which don't have these stamps.  
Further confirmation comes from the fact that B/L's attached to invoices sent 
back from customers (representing agreed settlement of a delivery) don't 
match the originals. 

Going Forward - I've not seen AA's scope but would expect it is comprehensive 
given the magnitude of the circumstances and history.  I would recommend that 
one of you have input just to assure that it is exhaustive and representative 
of issues of concern to RAC as well.  

I would assume the timeline/action items, if it exists beyond AA's work, 
would look something like the following.  To my knowledge there is not yet an 
aggregated list of action items beyond work by AA.  Thoughts or questions.

Action         Timing
Finalize the review of all Vnesh documents     Complete late this week
Agree no new business (and explicitly define bsns impacted)   Immediate as 
this does not appear to be discussed or agreed [note 1] 
Establish approach to recovery alternatives from Vnesh [note 2]  Starting 
Next week ??
Review other counterparty documentation for contingent liabilities  ??

note 1 - J Nowlan and I agreed back in Nov. that prepays were finished for 
now.  However, no new business at all out of Helsinki was not discussed since 
the issue of altered documentation had not come to light.  

note 2 - Apparently Vnesh delivered and documented product as fixed price 
delivered product at some point on all fixed price contracts (even the two 
they are now disputing as floating).  Therefore, by implication they have 
acknowledged the fixed nature through these deliveries.  This and other 
issues do suggest we may have a case for some measurable recovery once we 
know the severity of the document tampering issue.

Rick:

I suggest that you, Ted, D Hardy and I visit by phone in the next couple of 
days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved.  
It would be useful for D Hardy and I to further describe some of the behind 
the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups (ie. 
RAC, Acctg, Logistics, Legal and Commercial) and the sequence and timing of 
those conversations.  I believe it will be most useful for you to have a 
better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed 
among senior management in the coming weeks.  I firmly believe that the 
Accounting/Commcl. Support and Logistics groups got much to close to 
commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues.  Some of our 
more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came 
from commercial support and logistics, not just commercial.  Given the nature 
of discussions around this issue, it is important that we have this 
conference call some time this week.  Let me know when you have some time or 
alternatively have Karen schedule with Sharon.

On a related note, at some point there was a struggle within Liquids 
concerning control over trading in the Helsinki office (between London and 
Ilkka).  Although the Helsinki office was originally intended only as a 
marketing office, in some respects it evolved into a stand-alone operation.  
I can not see where there was a conscious decision for it to be more than a 
marketing outpost and it would appear the decision concerning the amount of 
control enjoyed by Ilkka and his team came solely down to K Beasley.  I would 
like to discuss this in this call as well.

Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. 
After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most 
appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. 
Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at 
the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at 
most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I 
want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or 
used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining 
appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, Rick Buy

Subject: New RPS

To all,

The New Retail Power System (RPS) has been implemented, and there are several 
features of RPS that I would like to share. 

1.)  Our Net Open Position is more accurate as a result of booking deals more 
reflective of batch models rather than Wholesale equivalent positions.

2.)  Our P&L is more accurate as a result of the position change and the 
ability to import retail energy curves into RPS rather than only wholesale 
curves.  

3.)  T&D positions can now be captured for Deals in RPS.

4.)  Regulatory Switching Options are being captured in RPS, which captures 
value of EES' option to serve customers during the CTC period.

5.)  Reporting capabilities are more timely and effective.


The Power Team is confident that RPS will better serve our business.

To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA "ELECTROBOLT")

Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to 
sign off soonest.  My comments follow:

Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and 
a guaranteed price.
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.
EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.  
We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week, 
the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that 
the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.  
$202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of 
overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a 
contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.
After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was 
going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this 
estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the 
numbers I saw last week.
Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by 
Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of 
Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due 
to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not 
totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, 
termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force 
majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me 
whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project 
would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a 
partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.
On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is 
reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.  
If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to 
$15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.
Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site 
condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears 
correct, if it is LHV.
O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee 
Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it 
agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras 
agreement.

Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the 
RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide 
to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma 
against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of 
experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I 
suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

Regards,

Larry

Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board:

 - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco)
 - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase)
 - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators)
 - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not)
 - sale of ECP (assume not)
 - sale of HPL (assume not).

Missed your call  today and I will be in RAC PRC all day tomorrow. Basically 
Jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the 
statement. He did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we 
said no, and I also said we know more about this company than any other 
exposure we have (which we should).

I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to 
pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract 
is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank. 

Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU 
through the plant purchase or other structured deal. Do no more (large) deals 
with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy 
a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously. Continue to stay on top of 
TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close 
relationship with good communication.

Lets try and discuss Wed if possible.

I go away for a day and come back to yet another $40 million of PGE exposure. 
I guess the lesson is to not go away. Where does this end? This is a painful 
way to learn about derivative credit exposure. Please inform all "deal doers" 
at EES that they better have RAC review their deals (Mercury) in detail 
before they sign. This is more out of control than anything else we have at 
Enron.

We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved

hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

  Holly Sugar Corporation

As some of you have heard, I have gotten back into the energy business.  I
finished my work in the private equity world with IGP and recently started
with Reliant Resources, the unregulated merchant business of Reliant
Energy.  The company is scheduled to IPO the first week in February with a
distribution of remaining shares some ten months later.  It's a great
challenge to build a business in the face of the upcoming electricity
deregulation in Texas.  For some of my Enron friends that were around when
ECT started trading power and really started growing, the challenge is very
similar.  I'm looking forward to it and I think it will be a lot of fun.

I'm head of a group called Transaction Development & Support focusing
primarily on the large C&I customers.  This group will be responsible for
structuring (that overused word again) deals, keeping the originators
focused on the proper segments of the market, getting the deals sold out
the back door and then tracking the remaining portfolio.

My new contact info is:

tel - 713.207.3170
cell - 713.898.9481
james_r_easter@reliantenergy.com

Now... for those of you looking for a good stock tip and who isn't, I would
strongly advise shorting Starbucks.  As I will no longer be consuming vast
quantities of overpriced latte while digesting the daily Arts section of
the New York Times, I fear for their ongoing viability.

Stay in touch and best wishes to you and your families for the Holidays.

Jim

Dear All,
It is a pleasant surprise to receive a message from Jim that he is back in
Houston again. It reminds me of the days with Enron. Coincidentally, I have
heard that Enron office in Bangkok will be completely closed at the end of
the year. Thai market is just not sophisticated enough for Enron. I still
hope that this great company will come back to my country again perhaps
when the power pool becomes a reality. The people I met still asked me
about Enron. Even during the annual economic seminar hosted by the US
embassy in Septemder this year, one of the speaker from the US has cited
Enron as an example of how good a company from the old economy has adopted
to the new environment,by trading broad band anb offer risk hedging
instruments on line,etc. Apparently, Enron does have some fans here.
I, myself, will assume the position of managing director of the Post
publishing Company, the owner of Bangkok Post newspaper as from the
first of February next year. In the mean time I busy myself as the
financial advisor to the City of Bangkok, handling some debt restructuring
cases
for a living (including one steel plate mill), and exchange gossip on power
and telecom projects as hobbies.
If I might be useful to you, please do not hesitate to contact me at this
e-mail address: pornlert@loxinfo.co.th, fax (662)7193513, or Mob.(661)8590021.
Hoping to see some of you again,
Merry X'mas and Happy New Year,
Pornlert

I was really hoping we could do this on a best efforts basis with all of us 
covering any issues arising during the month of December. Since there seems 
to be insistence on a date certain there is no choice but to have Steve start 
in EBS on 1-1-2001. Ted can't physically be there until then. It will be 
difficult to have full RAC responsibility without physically being there.

Rick,
Shane Dallman and I are trying to speak with James to discuss the Libor Curve 
and its impact on London's reporting.  The Libor curve is published daily in 
Houston at 3:00 pm (CST) at the close of US Trading.  

The Global Products books are now final closed from Houston so their areas 
should not be impacted.

We will update you when we have spoken to James regarding his areas and 
possible ways Rate & Currency can assist.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Just wanted to compliment Tom Moran, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett for 
all their efforts to help our commercial initiatives. As busy as they always 
are they are a pleasure to deal with and usually supportive of our 
transactions if the deal deserves their attention.

		 Subject: RAC Teams

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams 
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC 
and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a 
catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Rick

Subject: Re: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals  

Dave,

As of today, the Transaction Approval Process requires that any embedded 
financing over $500,000 needs to be DASHed.  RAC, however, is close to 
finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and 
tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval 
document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and 
maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For 
example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with 
standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated 
approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be 
available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured 
financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is 
manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met 
a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate 
credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of 
relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is 
impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the 
abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the 
Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with 
business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions 
approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In 
any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you 
for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the 
preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

Subject: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.  

Regards
Delainey

We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
commodity and a finance portion:

Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million
Avista/Kaiser    7/2000   7/2000 to 7/2006   $31.3 million   
BPA/Kaiser    9/2000   7/2001 to 9/2001   $36 million
Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?

Credit recommends offering the following two options to the New Power Company 
(NPC) as it relates to Firmwide collateral thresholds:

Option #1 - NPC receives a $10MM collateral threshold with standard 
collateral annex terms.

Option #2: - NPC receives a $40MM collateral threshold with standard annex 
terms as well as the following two additional required covenants:

a) Liquidity - Maintain minimum liquidity of $300MM, where:
 Liquidity = cash + marketable securities - debt - LCs - third party 
guarantees

b) Tangible Net Worth - Maintain minimum tangible net worth, as defined by 
GAAP, of $450MM
 Note: TNW will be equal to equity less intangible assets including but not 
limited to goodwill, trademarks, etc.

My daughter has reservations at Kingsway House, 71 Eardley Court. Can you see 
if anyone knows if this place is a disaster? She is going with a girlfriend 
that doesn't have hardly any money so they had to find a place that was cheap 
which worries me no end. Tx Rick

Rick, 

Attached is a listing of various incremental Phase II l/c's which we recently 
put together as part of the selldown.  The first table highlights the two 
l/c's which the sponsors have committed to.  Enron would have to pick up 
either 65% of these (if we can get MSEB to pick up their 15% share) or 80%.  
The other l/c's in the second table are solely the responsibility of DPC.  It 
would be up to the sponsors to decide to what extent they want to help 
support these.  Let's discuss if your numbers are different from these.

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Lee Steele at (713) 345-8259

Everyone,  - PLEASE DO NOT ERASE THE EMAIL --PLEASE RESPOND!!!!

Project Gem is approaching and Enron is going global with Windows 2000 
Migration.  They are trying to assist RAC in implementing the Migration in a 
successful fashion.  To do this, they have requested an inventory of each 
computer within RAC.   The Network managers have created a simplier and 
easier way to do this.   Each Group within RAC will have a Contact Person to 
work closely with them.  His name is Lee Steele.

Lee Steele, Manager of Enron Networks will be sending each of us an email 
regarding the Windows 2000 Migration.  He would like an inventory of each 
employees' computer applications.  On the said email that each of you receive 
from Lee, PLEASE open the link from your own computer.   According to Lee, 
this is very important because once you open the email, by clicking on the 
link, it will automatically list each application you have.   ....so again, 
please pay close attention to the Email from Lee Steele.


Lee, 

Look forward to receiving your email.


Thank you in advance.

Dorothy

A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our 
procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate 
action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
More to come.

Rick

Good Morning,


I spoke with Ilkka yesterday (prior to Robert Quick prohibiting to speak to
him.)  He asked me to deliver to John Nowlan the following message:

Regarding the Vneshtoprom case, if he is let to, he is willing to come to work
solely to try to sort out Vneshtoprom's debt to Enron. He thinks that in a 
month
he has either been able to get Vneshtoprom pay back the prepayment money or at
least gotten an original signed statement from them that how big the debt is 
and
a schedule to return the money.  After the job is done he would then leave the
company with whatever terms and conditions you guys would then sort out 
between
yourselves. If he is let to try to sort out the Vneshtopron debt, he wants to 
do
it without Kevin Beasley's or Goran Novokovic's help.

The feeling I got was that he is ready to negotiate this thing as quckly as
possible to an end.

I hope I have been able to summarize his thoughts in that way that you would 
at
least have a conversation with him. I think his orders are at the moment to 
sit
home and wait for Kevin's call.

The way I personally see the Vneshtoprom case is that without Ilkka's help 
there
is nobody who can do anything to help Enron get any money back. Whatever
happened last friday in Moscow, whatever accusations where made by 
Vneshtoprom,
I personally feel that the only reason for all that was to get Ilkka out of 
the
picture.

This is the response I sent to Mark a couple of weeks ago after I first heard 
of this matter.  I have since learned that they expect the cost overrun to be 
between $500-600,000 or $320-350,000 net to our interest.  Kelley has 
promised orally to pay their joint interest billings promptly, and the 
billings are being generated every two weeks.  Two have gone out; one of 
which for $403,000 has already been paid by Kelley.

Please let me know if there is anything further you'd like for me to do.

Mark:

I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash 
call issue that you had inquired about.   As I mentioned in my voicemail to 
you, I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had 
not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA.  I obtained copies 
of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation 
developed.  Steve was out of the office much of last week; he followed up 
Friday with the attached email message. 

As Steve mentions in his email, there were extenuating circumstances and 
timing issues, but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a 
well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed 
without appropriate review and approval.  I understand that John Thompson and 
Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a 
term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in 
short order.   Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get 
documentation finalized and in form for Steve's execution.  From Steve's 
reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout (which 
had been initialled by Allen), I believe he had assumed that had been the 
case in this situation as well, although he did not try to place 
responsibility on Allen.

Steve is one of the best and the brightest I've worked with at Enron.  He is 
extremely busy, working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E & P 
assets, as well as working on new deals.  I have worked with Steve enough to 
know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures.  
I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated.  I will remind 
the ECR group at Monday's staff meeting that review by the legal department 
is required before any agreements are signed.

Where do we go from here?  Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with 
Steve?  Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me 
to do. 

Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email.  In light of the level of 
activity for new ECR deals, time that is required in assisting Global Finance 
with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs, and the increased legal time 
required as Bonne Terre, Cypress, and Vastar are no longer managed by third 
parties, being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is 
increasingly difficult, and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed 
soon.

		 Subject: Kelly Farmout Agreement - Cypress Venture

Teresa:

Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain 
legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital 
Resources' (ECR) Cypress Venture.  The circumstances of the event follow to 
the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is 
presently inaccessible:

Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively 
low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil & Gas (sub of 
Contour Energy).  He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley 
controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000.

Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and 
receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect 
only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the 
prospect.  Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled 
and drilled the prospect.

Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout.  
Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that 
Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or 
farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or 
higher ORRI at its option.

Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the 
farmout agreement was drafted.  Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief 
letter agreement.  Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due 
to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells.  Rozel 
Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle.  
Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and 
Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each 
have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations.

Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the 
JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to 
Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement.  Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin 
and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a 
dialogue and rapport (we thought).  The initial draft of the farmout 
agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen.  Allen did not 
share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal 
provisions, particularly who would operate.  ECR members were in dispute over 
the importance of operations.

With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach 
terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior 
to the Sept. 28th lease expiration.  Allen and I continued to be frustrated 
with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was 
spudded.  I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an 
agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000).   
Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver 
the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no.  I asked 
him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it 
was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions.  I did not ask 
specifically about farmout agreements.  The Kelley farmout was the first 
farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered.  I failed to 
recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed 
by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures, 
and a farmout with Enron's name on the line.

It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review.  I have 
been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets 
(as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and 
signoff.  The compliance meeting last week underscored that point.  We had 
outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and 
Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval. 

I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be 
diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt 
as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or 
issue.

The demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is 
another issue that we should discuss.  The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar 
ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will 
continue.  Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA 
(to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial 
activity level.  We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted 
and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement 
on the S. Riceville prospect late next week.

I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in 
person if you desire.  I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval 
of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the 
mistake.  I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the 
immediate future on our direct-owned ventures.   I look forward to working 
with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian, 
Bonne Terre & Vastar ventures.

Louise Kitchen, who is now the President & CEO of Enron Net Works and I had a 
conversation about the space located at EB2801.  Louise had no objection to 
RAC occupying this space since her buildout could not occur until May.   The 
space rental should be allocated to 011/100068 and 011/100052 equally.

Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. 
After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most 
appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. 
Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at 
the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at 
most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I 
want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or 
used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining 
appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, Rick Buy

Are these numbers consistent with your expectations. We will submit to HR if 
no onjections. Traditionally Sutton has looked at the range and made the 
decision where to be inside the range. I don't know if Skilling will do the 
same. I have a voice mail into him to see. Rick

Subject: EcoElectrica/Corinto Valuations for Compensation Purposes

Rick,

The valuation ranges for EcoElectrica and Corrinto, as revised, are as 
follows:

EcoElectrica: High - $240.8 million (excludes FASB125 interest; terminal 
value discounted at 18%)

                         Low - $220.3 million (included $20.5 million of 
FASB125 interest as project cost)


Corinto:   High - $4.389 million (20% discount rate)

                   Low - $3.609 million (23.7% discount rate)

For EcoElectrica, the argument is whether the deal team should bear the cost 
of off-balance sheet treatment in choosing between the high and low values.  
For Corinto, the higher discount rate and lower value reflects how RAC would 
value this transaction as a new merchant deal, reflecting Nicaragua's 
downgrade; the lower discount rate is consistent with the original RAC 
discount rate and may be a reasonable discount rate for a completed plant to 
a strategic buyer.

Please let me know if you require additional information.  I am happy to 
speak with David Haug on these if you'd like.

Regards,

Dave

The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was 
considerable discussion which I have summarized below.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered 
positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a 
blended debt and equity return.(?)

Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I 
answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be 
needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.

Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. 
I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal 
and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below 
outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.

Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? 
Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come 
into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough 
cash to operate.

This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and 
not a rubber stamp.

Are you alive? How is your health? Is stress a big part of your life?

Hope all is well. You are doing a great job there for us but if it gets to be 
too much we'll try to help. I noticed that west power has already made a 
fortune this year so it must be crazy.

Rick, we are going to be running project payouts for Puerto Rico on Mark's 
numbers ($317mm valuation) and Mary Joyce asked that you approve the 
valuations due to the size of the project.  Can you please respond via email 
so that I'll have documentation for my files.  Thanks.

Per our conversation at Tuesday's meeting, hope the information below helps.

***************************************************

Can a non-web enabled application be launched/accessed from a portal? 

Answer:  Upon further verification, we have confirmed that a non-web enabled 
application can be launched/accessed from a portal to look as if it is web 
enabled; however, this is not an IT recommended practice.  Why?  If the user 
does not have appropriate software loaded on the PC, an error message will 
occur.  Per Philippe's group, this practice has been proven to be more of a 
challenge than a convenience.  

The portal page is just  HTML text and links. For non-web enabled 
applications, you won't be able to pull any of the application content into 
the portal.  The portal page can however, contain a link to the application, 
but any setup that is required on the user machine must exist in order to run 
the application. In other words, for something like a MS Word document, you 
won't be able to extract text from that document and display it on the portal 
page, but you could have a link to the Word document on the portal page and 
as long as the user had Word loaded on their machine, then it would start up 
MS Word and display the document. So, for MS Office applications it's not a 
problem because we know that Office is installed on all desktops. If  you're 
talking about proprietary in-house applications, then every desktop might not 
be configured for those applications.  This is where the problem starts.  

Implication:  It is critical for Enron to undertake an effort to ensure, 
ultimately, the most important, driving, in-house applications become web 
enabled and are available via the portal.  This will require development work 
which means it will take time and money for this to happen.  In some cases, 
significant costs may be required to make this happen.  For example, 
web-enabling SAP alone is in the $3 million plus range.  The Task Force plans 
to release a proposal defining a strategy to address how to make this happen 
and how much time and money will be required to make it happen.  

Can non-web-enabled information be accessed via a portal?

Answer: Yes, if the information is in a database and the IT organization is 
given access (given a password and ID), then the information can be accessed 
via a link from the portal.  If the information is not part of the database 
then it must be web enabled to be pulled from a portal.  Some information 
(such as an excel spreadsheets, a word doc., a .pdf file, etc.) not web 
enabled may be linked from a portal.  This access, however, would enable the 
viewer to manipulate the document and, in the case of excel, view the 
formulas behind the spreadsheet.  Some groups do not want this sensitive 
information available to users.  Users would not be able to save the changes 
back to the server, but would be able to print manipulated information.

Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to 
very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors. In 
order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer 
from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford. 
Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to 
immediately add value to the CRM group. 

It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign 
personnel as market needs suggest. Please join me in congratulating Ken on 
his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.

I'm actually holding up fine, thanks for asking.  Stress?  What stress?!  
Fortunately, our credit group has been able to cross-support as an effective 
team to support the other business that's going on OUTSIDE of California.  Up 
here, we call the California situation "Project Titanic".  Do you think 
that's too pessimistic?!

Credit recommends offering the following two options to the New Power Company 
(NPC) as it relates to Firmwide collateral thresholds:

Option #1 - NPC receives a $10MM collateral threshold with standard 
collateral annex terms.

Option #2: - NPC receives a $40MM collateral threshold with standard annex 
terms as well as the following two additional required covenants:

a) Liquidity - Maintain minimum liquidity of $300MM, where:
 Liquidity = cash + marketable securities - debt - LCs - third party 
guarantees

b) Tangible Net Worth - Maintain minimum tangible net worth, as defined by 
GAAP, of $450MM
 Note: TNW will be equal to equity less intangible assets including but not 
limited to goodwill, trademarks, etc.

Mark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.

Goal:
Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.

Performance:
Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee 
Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on 
earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over 
the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a 
template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes 
in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure 
prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging 
activity resulting from this effort.

Goal:
Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.

Performance:
Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across 
EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results 
presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place 
which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has 
agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit 
control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made 
against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with 
outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have 
highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best 
employed.

Goal:
Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.

Performance:
Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC 
which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking 
place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base 
system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these 
offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. 
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really 
understand where we have risks. It also helps in defining where we don't have 
responsibility such as EOTT,  Azurix  and The New Power Company.

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams 
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC 
and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a 
catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Rick

I attend a regular meeting with AA and Rick Causey discussing EES internal 
controls. They have asked for a detailed presentation on :

-EAM business
-Tariff curve summary and positions against those curves
-Credit issues in general.

I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and 
get it organized. EES may attend but not present. I think we should give them 
an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the 
above areas. Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two. Lets try to meet next 
week. 

Karen- please set up.

review  your department's bonuses on Thursday so that all of RAC can be 
submitted on Friday.   Thanks.

Rick,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding our Korean Won exposure.  As you 
know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges 
Corp or business unit.   

The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.  They mentioned 
that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:

1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level
2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference 
in 1 year rates between the two currencies.
3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.

Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.  The 
currency traders mentioned that they will bubble this issue up with Jim 
Hughes again later today.  

Thanks,

Rudi

Connie:

As you begin to tie down the assumptions on the various models, I would like 
to conduct "model reviews" like we used to do in EI.  A single meeting where 
the commercial people responsible for the business and relevant functional 
people all gather with you and I (I would also suggest Rick Buy attend) to 
review the model and the key assumptions.  The goal is less of a "police" 
function and more of an education process to increase understanding of the 
business.

Also, I think I am going to want someone dedicated to reviewing the work on 
the Dabhol model as we consider various renegotiation scenarios.  The 
decision making is too important to not have oversight.

Lastly, have you reviewed the modeling (both in ESA and at RAC) done on 
Cuiaba in connection with the recent board presentation?

Jim

Spoke with John Sherriff this am re prc for London RAC people. John said they 
included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our 
people where we saw fit. So I don't think there is any issue here. The 
Houston PRC rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to 
light to you Steve that calls into question a person's ranking. 

Sheila- please double check with the London HR people that this is 
straightened out. 

Thanks, Rick

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London. Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and mange the RAC activities which include credit and market 
risk and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market 
Risk activities. Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a 
new assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port 

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company. Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

The purpose of this e.mail is just to advise you that we will start the 
process of completing two DASH's for two large projects totaling about $1.6 
billion.  The customer is Panda Energy/TECO.  

Subject to Board approval, we would like to sign a contract sometime between 
15 - 20 December.

We have just recently agreed to a price and are now entering into contract 
negotiations.  

We will immediately apply the "Risk Book Model" to these two projects; and we 
will begin working a DASH with the RAC group.  Because each of these 
contracts will total about $800MM, I wanted to give you a heads-up.  If we 
can achieve a contractual agreement with TECO and receive Enron Corporate 
approval, these could prove to be outstanding projects for NEPCO, because the 
two contracts are really the duplication of eight similar projects and doing 
them repetitively, should prove very profitable for NEPCO.

Deal needs to go to Skilling (or OOC) because capital price exceeds return. 
Otherwise Frevert could sign. I am authorised to sign for Jeff up to $25 MM 
after I leave him a voice mail. After I review deal I will voice mail Jeff 
and that should work. Rick

Here is a "risk management" slide that I think you will find entertaining.
- I know this is silly, but it is perfect too. (Maybe you can use it in one
of your presentations.) - Enjoy!

Recognizing we were just below daily VAR limits today, coupled with the high 
volatility in the crude and products markets, we attempted to do an interday 
calc. Unfortunately it took us some time to get the right person but we did 
succeed in getting an  estimate right at the close which showed we were very 
near our limits as we were yesterday. I flag this up to point out it is 
critical in these ,markets that we have some cover or know who we can call if 
we need this type of interday analysis.

Rick-  

Thanks for the DASH for the Harvard case study. 

I know that you changed the name and some numbers, but I just wanted to check 
that you are comfortable with it being included as an example in a study that 
will be published and taught.

Please confirm.

Thanks. 

Mike

Subject: RAC final pack

Hi Steve,

I am attaching the final version of your 2001 plan so that you get a chance 
to review it before our meeting on Monday. 

The new pack reflects any changes that were discussed at our last meeting, 
namely  a reduction in training courses to 2 per person and an increase in 
economy versus business flights .

I have also revisited the 2000 forecast and adjusted where necessary to 
reflect most recent running rates. I have  changed the 2000 headcount figures 
to reflect November actuals and have assumed no new starters in December so 
if this is inaccurate I will need to amend here. 

You will need to view the "direct" and "rsc" sheets to see the information. 


Let me know if you have any problems.

Many Thanks

Carmel

Per your voice mail I would like to defer 100% of my ECT Phantom Stock into 
the Stable Asset fund. I only want to defer that which I have to defer due to 
my Section 16b status. Thanks, Rick Buy

Subject: EES Update - Task Force Issues

1. EES P&L Recap - Last 5-days:

  Trading P&L   Total P&L (included origination, prudency changes, etc.)
 12/5 Loss of 31.9 million  Loss of 27.3 million
 12/6 Loss of 30.1 million  Loss of 28.2 million
 12/7 Loss of 16.4 million  Loss of 16.2 million
 12/8 Loss of  28.6 million  Loss of 28.7 million
 12/11 Loss of  16.8 million  Loss of 23.5 million
 12/12 likely more losses (~$25 million)

 Total Loss of  123.8 million  Loss of 123.9 million

As of 12/11 EES VaR was $6.7 MM

2. Hedging Positions:

On Sunday night, December 10th, Tim Belden and John Lavorato have offered Don 
Black to flatten EES 2001 West positions at a given price (I suspect in the 
range of $100 million). EES declined.

In the last few days Belden has helped EES flatten their Jan/01 positions and 
is currently working on hedging remaining Q1/01 exposure. In Belden's view, 
it is going to be rather difficult to substantially lay-off EES exposure to 
third parties in the next few weeks. Liquidity has completely dried-up, most 
trading counterparties have flattened their books and are not willing to take 
on a lot of exposure. Nonetheless, EES is trying hard to hedge their exposure 
and have been taking off positions (2001 NP/COB Spread) in the last few days 
and will continue to do so as liquidity permits.

3. Deal Analysis - the following deals are expected to close before year-end:

  VaR  Incremental VaR
Eli Lilly  $1.57 MM TBD by Minal
Pilkington $0.7 MM TBD by Minal
ECS  $1.0 MM TBD by Minal
CHE  TBD by Minal TBD by Minal
JC Penney waiting for positions

I have asked Dennis to estimate how much of the market risk embedded in these 
deals they will be able to hedge in the market or through ENA. Then, we will 
be able to determine whether EES requires a temporary VaR increase and 
process a request, accordingly (the $2 million allocation expires after 
12/15).

JC Penney is estimated to be the largest deal ever executed by EES with 6300 
sites, behind some 200 utilities, over 240 models and significant positions. 
It is my understanding that current deal NPV is estimated at $10 million, 
before credit reserve. Given that this deal will add significant incremental 
market, credit and EAM (rather iffy engineers' estimates) risks to the 
portfolio, I suggest to discuss deal economics with the deal team before 
committing more resources to it.

Vlady.

As part of the Business Risk Management Process (BRM) we will be reviewing 
the processes for setting up and managing the remote offices. 
This review will be conducted by Arthur Andersen who will be reporting to me 
directly.

The review requires input from many areas of the business which have been 
identified in the attached chart. I would be grateful if you could complete 
the sections of the questionnaire that have been identified as  relevant to 
yourself. 

To complete the questionnaire you are required to provide an answer to each 
question raised  by marking one of the evaluation boxes  and providing any 
comments that you feel are relevant.

If you are able to complete  other sections of the questionnaire , please 
feel free to do so as the more input we receive the better . Similarly  
please add any additional comments or suggestions concerning the setting up 
or management of remote offices  not covered in the questionnaire.

The questionnaire should be returned by 20 December to  Sarah Williams of AA 
with a copy to myself

If you have any questions do not hesitate to call myself or Sarah

Many thanks for your co-operation.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Shane and I spoke yesterday regarding the USD curve. Whilst taking a curve 
other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a 
formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&L 
concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our 
USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is 
going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at 
attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the 
amounts). Depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the 
business heads here in London.

Rick,
Shane Dallman and I are trying to speak with James to discuss the Libor Curve 
and its impact on London's reporting.  The Libor curve is published daily in 
Houston at 3:00 pm (CST) at the close of US Trading.  

The Global Products books are now final closed from Houston so their areas 
should not be impacted.

We will update you when we have spoken to James regarding his areas and 
possible ways Rate & Currency can assist.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

David:

I asked Kevin when the issue of altering B/L's, or any documentation 
(contractual or logistical) for that matter, first came up in Helsinki or 
London.  Following is in response.  How does the timing (ie. last April per 
Kevin) compare to your understanding?  Specifically, I want to know the date 
it was first noted and raised as individuals in Helsinki said the issue had 
been raised up to 2 times prior to April of last year (as early as Late 
1998).  Likewise, do you know what exactly was communicated on any occasions 
in 1998 or 1999 with Helsinki or London staff on this issue?  When I asked 
Henkka what had occurred previously, he had no recollection of any 
communication on this last April.

I think that is the best thing, not to get them to sign anything, just really 
to get the point across that 
they cannot do it. They know that, because I have had similar discussions

felt uncomfortable with the whole situation.

Don't worry.  I just want them to understand that they are a control

agreement.

Let me know what you think.

Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to 
very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors. In 
order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer 
from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford. 
Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to 
immediately add value to the CRM group. 

It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign 
personnel as market needs suggest. Please join me in congratulating Ken on 
his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.

Who should I speak with about policies for setting up new/remote office?  Are 
there any?  Likewise, I have a copy of the Risk Mgt Policy (amended 
10/20/99).  Are there other policies or related that I should be aware of?  
I'm getting more of these type of questions and am not clear on what exists 
beyond what I already have so some central file or point of contact would 
help.  

More immediately, we're evaluating new SFA procedures traditionally focused 
on the banks.  It's possible our capital requirements could be impacted and 
on a worst case basis EEL's capital requirement could be substantial.  I'll 
keep you posted on anything major.

Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that 
we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare 
a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a 
meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically 
a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria 
and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that 
would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in 
economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and 
proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a 
Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, Rick

Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision. He is willing to enter into the 
deal. His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final 
analysis. He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as 
appropriate for the circumstances. He also wanted to know if there is 
anything different here than on OWC. I told him that it wasn't significantly 
different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)

Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get 
his verbal signature.

Was speaking w/ Lavo today on a different matter and he mentioned you were a 
great help to him in managing his world and was quite complementary overall. 
I can count on one hand how often this happens in RAC so keep it up.  Great 
job. Thanks, Rick

Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet with the basic concept of payment rates, 
with a slight deterioration modeled as an example.  With this format, once 
the AR ages past 120 days one can see the pattern of ultimate payment, and 
the ultimate effectiveness of collection efforts.   I will speak with Rick 
Buy about implementation.

The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force. The 
following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows:

Legacy Opportunity

Molly Harris
Teresa Seibel
James Copeland
Michael Tribolet
Jay Hachen
Minal Dalia
Don Rollins
Rick Carson
Jeff Soo
Debbie Brackett
Sue Vasan

On Going Opportunities

Denise Fury
Mark Wilson
Dana Smith
Andrew Greer
Martin O'leary
Jay Hachen
Dave Gorte
Darren Schmidt
Vladi Gorny
David Port
Jeff Soo

This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it 
is necessary. If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint Michael 
Tribolet to manage the task. If you want someone else to manage the  effort 
we will assist as we can. Regardless of who leads this effort we need 
following:

Commitment of EES back office staff people 
Commitment of IT resources
Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am 
under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.

Let me know how to launch this program.

Rick
