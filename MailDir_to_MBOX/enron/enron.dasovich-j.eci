Thanks to everyone who attended the EBS strategy session in New Orleans last 
week.  I know how busy everyone is and Donald and I greatly appreciate your 
willingness to work with us to better support EBS and Enron's communications 
interests.  I would be happy to follow up with anyone who didn't get a chance 
to make it.  I am attaching our meeting notes, to be followed (due to size 
concerns) by the presentations from EBS Network Development and EBS Sales.  I 
am in DC this week, so if anyone needs to contact me, try my cell at 
503-807-2935.  Thanks.

Interactive Week   11/1/99

 Wall Street enthusiasm and a growing list of brand-name clients have 
legitimized content distribution as a business, putting two
 companies that started it all - Akamai Technologies and Sandpiper Networks - 
into the spotlight.

 Digital Island's $630 million acquisition of Sandpiper last week and 
Akamai's $2.2 billion pre-initial public offering valuation are likely
 to make merger and acquisition artists wonder how much their company would 
be worth with the inclusion of a Sandpiper or
 Akamai. Akamai, which priced it shares at $26, saw its stock hit $125.50 in 
midday trading Oct. 29.

 Digital Island, the San Francisco-based Web hosting shop that was worth $1.2 
billion on Oct. 25 when it announced the Sandpiper
 acquisition, saw its market capitalization gain $1 billion in the course of 
four days.

 Why are the services of Akamai and Sandpiper so valuable all of a sudden? 
The Internet can't deliver Web - much less broadband -
 content fast enough, and network backbone companies are taking too long to 
solve the bottleneck puzzle, industry experts said.

 "We looked at content sites A through Z, and 52 percent of them are planning 
to buy content delivery services next year," said Greg
 Howard, principal analyst and owner of the HTRC Group, a market research 
company.

 With customers that eager to show service providers the money, many are 
scrambling to deliver.

 In a space where a year ago Sandpiper was a lone evangelist and Akamai a 
rocket from nowhere, new content distributors are
 popping up like mushrooms.

 Adero, Edgix and Mirror Image are three companies that are gaining mindshare 
in the market. Since at the core of a content
 distribution system lies a massive task managing hundreds and eventually 
thousands of caches operated as one network, such
 companies as iBeam Broadcasting and SkyCache are also gaining credibility in 
the market.

 And then there are a few sudden entrants. Enron Communications and Exodus 
Communications are trying to amend existing
 business models to take advantage of the new opportunity.

 How big is the opportunity? The content distribution market, Howard said, 
will grow from $62 million this year to $306 million next
 year, and to about $2.3 billion in 2002.

 Acquisition as an exit strategy is certainly something new content 
distributors are thinking about.

 "I think it's hard to say what will happen in this industry next. All 
business models are very different," said Rangu Salgame, president
 and chief executive of Edgix. "I think we will stand independent - for a 
while."

 Potential buyers include any given content provider - from CNN Interactive 
to Pets.com - that writes three checks every month: one
 for bandwidth, one for Web hosting and, lately, one for content 
distribution. These groups have the most to gain from content
 delivery services, executives said.

 "There are a couple of likely players in this space. One, there are new 
start-ups like Adero and specialized content distributors like
 Intervu; two, there are colocation providers like Exodus; and three, there 
are traditional telcos like MCI WorldCom, who are
 standing on the sidelines right now, but have a lot of edges for content to 
reside on," said Leo Spiegel, president and CEO of
 Sandpiper, soon to be Digital Island.

 What would happen if any given company were to buy all three components?

 "This would mean running content distribution through a single network and 
maintaining a global footprint," Howard said. "It is hard,
 but doable."

 There are reasons why the network-content distributor combination could 
backfire. Akamai executives declined interviews for this
 story due to the Securities and Exchange Commission-imposed quiet period. 
But in the past, they have been vocal about a single
 network scenario being untenable for content distribution because their 
business model is predicated on carrier neutrality. This is why
 Internet service providers and telephone companies are open to content 
distributors colocating servers within their networks.

 Another possible exit strategy for content distributors is to sell out to 
large media companies such as America Online, Disney and
 Time Warner. These companies could maintain the content distributors' 
"Switzerland" status and still use the service as a competitive
 advantage by speeding up content delivery, industry watchers said.

Jeff, 
I've spoken to Robin Hill's office, (EBS Legal) and this is what we need to 
get the NDA shipped:
1) Legal entity name 
2) Business Address
3) if possible, name and title of signatory party at IOS

Please get this information together and send to Robin Hill.  She should be 
able to return the NDA in 2 business days.
By the way, I spoke with Matt Harris, and we think this opportunity would be 
best handled by Kirk Neuner's group.  What is your take?
Thanks,

Dan Minter

The issue taking time to resolve is the ability to disclose under the
existing agreement, even with an NDA.  Will keep you posted.  One smaller
issue on the NDA is that ISO wants to make sure that info can't be given to
the Enron power affiliates.  I assume thatr won't be a problem.

Steve, not to get too wrapped up in a name, but I think Enron 
Telecommunications may be confusing.  Can we use something more innocuous 
like Enron Communications Ltd. or Enron Communications North America?  Just 
thinking out loud.

Robin, here is my understanding:

1.  It will be a owned by ECI.
2.  Conduct regulated telecommunications activities
3.  A corporation
4.  I suggest the name Enron Telecommunications, Inc.  or a variation using 
Telecommunications.

Subject: New ECI Company

I have a couple of preliminary questions regarding the formation of the new 
entity we need to form for ECI regulated transactions.

1) Do we know who is going to be the shareholder? (Enron Communications Group 
Inc. owns 100% of ECI)
2) I need a business purpose for the Authorization and Justification 
Memorandum which is required for all new entities.
3) Is this going to be a Corporation or a LLC?

I think it would be a good idea to put the same slate of officers and 
directors as we have in place for ECI.  This is just an attempt to get the 
ball rolling so if you could get back to me I would appreciate it.  

P.S. We will try to stay away from Enron Communications 2, Inc. for the 
name!  Please send me your suggestions!

Thanks
Robin Hill

Scott--give me some guidance on how important or relevent this issue is for
us so that I can get a better understanding of what I should/should not
being spending time on.

The Minnesota PUC ruled yesterday the US West must open/share it's lines
with competitors offering digital subscriber line (DSL) high speed interent
access. =01;Apparently the order is the first for a state, but I understand
that the FCC passed a similiar rule in the last month or so. =01;The
Commission also ruled that USWest could charge an additional $6.00 for this
access to their lines (in addition to the current rate of $18 that the
customer pays) and that the DSL provider had the right to pass that charge
on to the customer. =01;The COmmission took a "soft" position on the $6.00,
saying that they would review the amount of the charge over the next six
months before making a final ruling on that specific issue. =01;I believe t=
hat
this ruling came about due to an initial complaint by =01;a provider from
Colorado.

I did not follow this case at all other than occassionally reading
something about it. The major reason I did not was that I saw it as a
"retail" access issue and I see our video streaming and bandwidth
businesses as "wholesale" access/opportunity issues. =01;Certainly we alway=
s
want to see open access and we want to see competitive parity, but I didn't
see that our involvment and/or tracking of this proceeding was of great
value. =01;Am I correct?

The commission has issued a new rulemaking, R. 00-02-003, to address CEQA 
review for CLECs. 
Parties should file their responses to the following questions no later than 
March 15, 2000.

1. Is the Commission's existing practice for authorizing new CLECs adequate 
to comply with CEQA and to protect California's environmental resources?
2. Is the Commission's existing policy of allowing incumbent local exchange 
carriers and cellular carriers to construct new facilities without 
environmental review in compliance with CEQA? Does it promote adequate 
protection of California's environmental resources?
3. Do local authorities and other government agencies have adequate 
opportunities to protect local environmental resources under the current set 
of Commission practices and policies regarding incumbent local exchange 
carriers and CLECs? If not, how should this circumstance be remedied?
4. Does the Commission's existing practice for authorizing new CLECs create a 
competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain carriers? If so, how might 
those disparities be eliminated or reduced?
5. Is the Commission's existing practice for authorizing new long distance 
carriers adequate to comply with CEQA and to protect California's 
environmental resources?
6. Is the Commission's existing policy of allowing incumbent long distance 
carriers to construct new facilities without environmental review in 
compliance with CEQA? Does it promote adequate protection of California's 
environmental resources?
7. Do local authorities and other government agencies have adequate 
opportunities to protect local environmental resources under the current set 
of Commission practices and policies regarding long distance carriers? If 
not, how should this circumstance be remedied?
8. Does the Commission's existing practice for authorizing new long distance 
carriers create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain carriers? 
If so, how might those disparities be eliminated or reduced?

Are we interested in this proceeding? Attached is a copy of the rulemaking.

Please explain the deletion of the provision precluding sharing of the
confidential information between Enron Comm and other Enron entities.  As
ISO indicated to you this is a key regulatory concern of theirs, and I do
not want to forward this until I understand Enron's position.

I believe that ISO will only accept California or New York law for their
agreements, but will check when I hear back from you.

Hi Jim:

Please find attached EBS's proposed modifications to the changes you
proposed.  Perhaps the biggest issue is which state's laws will govern.
We're open to Oregon, Delaware, or Texas.  California's a problem.  Let me
know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Sue et al---as we discussed last week, Scott Bolton and I had a conference 
call on Friday with a coalition that is forming to promote national broadband 
infrastructure policies.  The members are currently Global Crossing (Michael 
Freedman), Level 3 (Jim Pribyl), Williams and Quest.  

The preliminary game plan of the coaltion is to target this policy initiative 
in states where 1) there are currently problems or impediments such as bad 
legislation or strong pushes for franchise fees for broadband 2) states with 
opportunities 3)states where we collectively have heavy presence such as west 
coast/east coast.  The intent is to have only a few companies involved--about 
5 or 6, with a commitment of time from the members and probably some 
financial commitment in the $25,000 to $50,000 range over time (I'm thinking 
12-18 months)

I will be seeing a few of these guys at the RGA meeting in Tampa at the end 
of the week, and there will be another formal meeting in the next 3 or 4 
weeks which Scott is going to try to attend.  

I'd appreciate if if we could discuss at our EBS conference call on Monday 
morning if there is time.

Therefore, we do not need or want it returned to him or our department.  
Thanks, however, 
for all your efforts in getting it checked and/or repaired.  Apologies for 
any inconvenience this may
have caused.

If you have any questions regarding the above, you may speak to Hans Maverick

		 Subject: NDA for Potential Opportunity with the California ISO

All of the following should be considered confidential information.  In 
addition to the information, the ISO prefers to keep the simple fact that 
they are meeting with us confidential.

As you recall, we met the CIO/EVP of the California ISO regarding the ISO's 
excess broadband capacity.  The ISO is very interested in determining if EBS 
can devise a solution.

The ISO's outside counsel has reviewed the NDA we provided and made 
comments.  The redlined version is included below for review.  Still 
uncertain if there's a deal here.  The idea is to get the NDA signed in order 
to get considerably more info from the ISO and then determine whether there's 
an opportunity.  Please review the proposed changes and let me know if there 
are any issues/problems.  The ISO's big concern is ensuring that it doesn't 
get crossways with MCI w.r.t. confidentiality, but they've told me they've 
cleared that hurdle. Here is the note the ISO outside counsel used to 
describe the changes:

Jeff:

Attached is a revised version of the proposed NDA, together with a redline
showing changes from the Enron version.  The main reasons for changes were
to (1) limit data to the Enron telecom entity, and (2) assure compliance
with ISO's  MCI agreement.

Let me know if there are any remaining issues.

Jim

I've also include some info that Dan Minter and I culled from the initial 
meeting with the ISO.

The Network
MCI built the system.
The ISO currently shares its private, dedicated network 50-50 with the 
California Power Exchange, though the ISO like to take control of 100% of the 
asset.
The network consists of 4 OC-12s  and as part of the contract, the ISO has a 
call to upgrade at no or very little cost to 4 OC-48s.
This "scalability" was built in to accommodate what California believed would 
be a very large and rapidly growing number of users (mostly scheduling 
coordinators), but California greatly underestimated the number.  So the ISO 
is left with considerable excess capacity.
About 1/2 the capacity is currently used by the PX, but the ISO would like to 
terminate that relationship as quickly as possible (if possible).
It's an ATM switched network with 11 A-PoPs and 4 B-Pops and it runs from 
Folsom (Sacramento) to Alhambra (around Pasadena).  The B-PoP locations are 
Hayward, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Claremont.


The Contract
The ISO pays about $30-35 million/yr under the contract---significantly above 
market.
The contract ends at the end of 2003.
The contract includes a costless, or very low cost, option to upgrade from 
OC-12 to OC-48 (we'd need to find out "how costless," and how long it would 
take to upgrade if the ISO exercised the option).
The contract also permits interconnection to the network (by MCI) for $485, 
irrespective of difference from the grid.  Access to the network is defined 
as DS1.

The Goals of the ISO's EVP/CIO

Reduce costs immediately.   Needs to take a plan designed to mitigate the 
costs to the Board in 60 days.
Wants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows.
"Would like to do a short term deal, for "nonfirm" service and get  a high 
price," but would do a long-term, firm deal if it reduced his costs 
significantly.

Tracy,

they need every single name on the attached list, so feel free to cut and

Hey KC

What's up?  How are you today?  Kris, can u help me out with this bio 
question -- do we have them in a database?  Or do you have the readily 
available version?  If so, would you mind terribly forwarding to me and/or 
Jeff Dasovich at the address below --  I know that we have the hard copy 
available and where to get that, but I don't know where the e version is.  
 thanks KC

Tracy: 

 My apologies, but I don't seem to have the final, electronic version of the 
bios of EBS management that we included in the California filing (Scott did 
the last version to ensure accuracy--the filed version reads "As of March 1, 
2000.")  Ms Nord needs an electronic copy.  Might you have one that you could 
pass along to her (and to me)?  As always, many thanks.  

Jeff

Actually, how about Enron Communications Broadband Services?  It is similar 
to Telecommunications but sounds much more advanced.  And considering Scott 
Yeager's pitch at the Apps conference that eCI would become the world's 
leading broadband applications provider, it seems to fit.  Thoughts anyone?

Steve, not to get too wrapped up in a name, but I think Enron 
Telecommunications may be confusing.  Can we use something more innocuous 
like Enron Communications Ltd. or Enron Communications North America?  Just 
thinking out loud.

Robin, here is my understanding:

1.  It will be a owned by ECI.
2.  Conduct regulated telecommunications activities
3.  A corporation
4.  I suggest the name Enron Telecommunications, Inc.  or a variation using 
Telecommunications.

Subject: New ECI Company

I have a couple of preliminary questions regarding the formation of the new 
entity we need to form for ECI regulated transactions.

1) Do we know who is going to be the shareholder? (Enron Communications Group 
Inc. owns 100% of ECI)
2) I need a business purpose for the Authorization and Justification 
Memorandum which is required for all new entities.
3) Is this going to be a Corporation or a LLC?

I think it would be a good idea to put the same slate of officers and 
directors as we have in place for ECI.  This is just an attempt to get the 
ball rolling so if you could get back to me I would appreciate it.  

P.S. We will try to stay away from Enron Communications 2, Inc. for the 
name!  Please send me your suggestions!

Thanks
Robin Hill

Your welcome.  Also take a look at AB 1007 (Wayne) relating to internet 
privacy
(I've linked it below).  If you're concerned with privacy issues, another hot 
topic
is  SB 129 (Peace).  That bill intends to set up a privacy ombudsperson 
within the
Secretary of State's office and establish administrative penalties for privacy
violations.  It's currently in a conference committee.

With respect to SB 1217, the bill was aimed directly at Excite@Home and their 
deal
with TCI.   Certainly Excite and TCI opposed the bill.  I believe other cable
companies, including TimeWarner Cable also opposed the bill.  Supporters 
included
GTE and AOL.  It is my understanding that AOL will probably oppose the bill 
now
because of the merger.

I'll let you know if anything else develops.

Jeff:

It looks like Tim Stamnitz, CEO of Global Photon, could schedule a meeting
at 3PM on either July 5 or 6 at their office in San Diego.(One American
Plaza,
600 West Broadway, Suite 1200, San Diego, CA  92101.

I could attend either of these times as well.  We will need to finalize the
NDA before financials are disclosed, so probably that will all happen at the
meeting if we get the NDA worked out over this coming week.

As I indicated, I will be in Denver next week, but can get voicemail and
email.

Hi Tom:  I'm in the government affairs office in San Francisco and saw your 
presentation to the group last year.  I just got a call from someone who 
apparently has a lot of capacity available and wants to know if he can 
somehow exploit Enron's bandwidth trading platform to market it.   Is there 
someone I can have him get in touch with to find out if it's possible?  Best,

there's the weeklies and monthlies who were there

LighTrade Aims For Bandwidth Boom With "Points"
Monday, February 14, 2000 03:29 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By Michael Rieke 
	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Washington, D.C. entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on 
a boom in bandwidth trading. 
	His company, LighTrade Inc., will spend $20 million-$25 million this year to 
install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth, or space on telecom lines, 
in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle 
and Washington, D.C. 
	Bandwidth trading is growing, driven by increased demand by businesses for 
the Internet. In a report released last December, CIBC World Markets 
estimated that 20% of total bandwidth traffic, or $12 billion in revenues, 
could be traded in some manner within five years. 
	Last week, Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, 
news, msgs) announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit. 
	LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or 
telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites, known as pooling 
points, Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires. 
	The points connect telecommunications carriers, allowing data to move from 
one network to another. They are installed in "telecom hotels," buildings 
that house carrier facilities, and essentially consist of a Lucent 
Technologies Inc. (LU, news, msgs) bandwidth manager about the size of a 
tall, narrow refrigerator. 
	Enron Broadband Services, a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), 
established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles. It 
plans to build another in London this year. 
	Last year, Enron Corp. proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized 
contract. It executed the first trade under the contract in December, buying 
space on a monthly basis on a New York-Los Angeles line from Global Crossing 
Ltd. of Bermuda. 
	Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research firm, 
has charged that Enron's ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in 
bandwidth trades. 
	Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the 
bandwidth trading market get off the ground, said Stephen Kamman, a 
telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets. 
	It's a "very positive" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom 
Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 
	"This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are 
interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for 
the open trading of bandwidth," Gros said. 
	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for 
years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies 
must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length 
of contract and quality of service. 
	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But 
with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such 
terms are less attractive. 
	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth 
trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms 
and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States 
are vying to form such a group. 
	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, 
Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 
U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 
	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how 
quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading 
bandwidth as a commodity. 
	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and 
Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets 
as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a 
likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 
	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio 
de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo 
and Osaka. 
	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year 
and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 
	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its 
bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech 
company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on 
LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would 
invest in his company. 
	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications 
attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded 
company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. 
That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 
	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three 
major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the 
companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling 
points, but he expects others to enter the market. 
	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop 
pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, 
he said. 
	"But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very 
significant economic return," Pierson said.

Jeff:? The FCC 214 number we discussed references a license as an Interstate 
Carrier, which you should apparently not need at this junture.? However, can 
you send the document itself regarding this issue to make sure? 
???????? Texas requires an inital COA or SPCOA (certificate of operating 
authority) depending on your business plan, and the CLEC application asks for 
NECA 
( National Exchange Carriers Association) i.d. number if you have one; it 
also asks for a FCC CIC (Carrier Identification Code) "if available" - 
perhaps this is what you were referring to; and that would probably not be an 
impediment to filing. 
??? Anita can check with Texas if you need more information - we do it all 
the time and so it's no problem. Thanks.

This gives a little flavor of how we factor into the backbone capacity market.

 Description Building A Better Backbone - And Business Plan
 :

 Detail:



By Carol Wilson, Inter@ctive Week
September 6, 1999 6:23 AM PT



The numbers are staggering: Six major new national fiber-optic networks will
come on line during
the next two years at a cost of $18 billion. Those new networks are in 
addition
to those already
built and operated by the Big Three of long-distance: AT&T, MCI WorldCom and
Sprint.

Thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable are being installed in ducts to which
new fiber can be
easily added by companies such as Enron Communications, Frontier 
Communications,
IXC
Communications, Level 3 Communications, Qwest Communications International and
Williams
Communications.

And that's just a piece of the story.

While competition in the backbone network business is booming, new 
technologies
coming into
the market will make it much easier to increase bandwidth available on any
fiber-optic network
tenfold or more. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems now 
exist
to put data
traffic onto 160 different wavelengths on a single fiber-optic cable. 
Technology
exists today to
enable each of those wavelengths to transport 10 gigabits per second of data.
Within two years,
that will reach 40 gigabits per wavelength per second.

"In effect, the backbone of the Internet is being rebuilt. The next step:
Recover all those costs of
construction,'' says analyst Peter Bernstein at Infonautics Consulting. "And
that step may be more
difficult than building the networks themselves.''

The combination of major new network construction and new technology for 
adding
network
capacity has led industry analysts and executives to predict a bandwidth glut
that is likely to drive
down prices in backbone transport of data much as the price of long-distance
telephony has
plummeted in the past few years. Frontier Communications admitted as much
earlier this year
when its second-quarter earnings weren't up to expectations.

Rather than a free fall in prices, however, expect the market to quickly find
new ways to use
bandwidth, both in terms of network-based applications and bigger backbone
networks to
support the rapidly growing field of faster access via Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) and cable
modems. The challenge for network operators is to create new business models
that capitalize on
something other than cheaper bandwidth.

"I think the danger isn't so much of a glut as a lack of planning for the
backbone network that
could cause some major problems," says Claudia Bacco, an analyst at TeleChoice
who studies the
development of DSL. "Once DSL starts selling as a volume service, it will very
quickly increase
the demand for bandwidth in the backbone. Service providers need to have 
planned
ahead."

It's not surprising, then, to see a growing number of alliances between the 
new
backbone builders
and the competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) that have been building 
DSL
networks in
major markets across the U.S.

Qwest invested in both Covad Communications and Rhythms NetConnect-ions, for
instance, and
a third data CLEC, NorthPoint Communications, includes Enron, Frontier and 
Level
3 among its
strategic partners.

That doesn't mean, however, that all of the companies investing billions in
burying fiber-optic cable
stand to reap rich rewards, cautions Bernstein at Infonautics.

"The problem isn't a glut of bandwidth, but a glut of service providers," he
says. "If everyone has
the same business model and is going after the same customers, that's a 
problem.
In addition, there
are timing issues . . . If you build it, they will come - but not necessarily
when you need them to."

At least nine players have built or are building national fiber-optic backbone
networks. These look
very similar, says Fred Harris, director of network planning and design at
Sprint. "There are
generally three East-West routes and three or four North-South routes that
everyone builds," he
says. "New York to San Francisco, Atlanta to Los Angeles, Seattle to Boston -
everybody has
fiber either in or near those corridors."

In earlier network deployments, the fiber was buried, never to be exhumed. But
today's fiber
cables go into ducts, allowing fibers to be pulled out or slid in later.
Capacity can be added
without any backhoes.

Today's newer fiber-optic cable, from companies such as Corning and Lucent
Technologies, is
designed to support higher transmission speeds without the light dispersion
problems that limited
speeds or distances on other fiber-optic cables.

DWDM technology and optical amplifiers, which boost the power of a laser's
signal over a given
wavelength, enable bandwidth to be added and allow signals to travel farther
without the need for
as many repeaters to boost signals along the way. Eliminating repeaters in a
long-distance network
wrings out installation, maintenance and power costs.

As Harris points out, if every company building a national backbone has 30
fibers along each
major route, and each fiber can carry 80 different wavelengths of light, 
that's
more than 20,000
different signals. Today, most of those signals would be powered by 
Synchronous
Optical
Network (SONET) gear, which operates at 2.5 gigabits per second, but a growing
number have
moved up to gear that operates at 10 Gbps.

Both Lucent and Nortel Networks have announced equipment that supports 160
wavelengths on
a single cable, and other vendors will have similar equipment within the next
two years.

Also coming into the market by 2002 will be new SONET gear that quadruples the
current
transmission rates from 10 Gbps to 40 Gbps. MCI WorldCom is testing these
systems, known as
OC-768 transmission systems, and expects to have one commercially available by
early 2001,
says Rama Nune, senior manager of optical and data network technology
development.

Nune stresses, however, that what's more important than having all the 
bandwidth
is knowing
"how to intelligently provision services over it and manage it."

New Models

Not surprisingly, most of the newer network operators have quickly moved to
talking about
services, not bandwidth.

There are exceptions to this: Enron is building a network that transmits
Internet Protocol
(IP)-based traffic directly over a fiber-optic network, with no intervening
transport systems or
protocols. But its network is built to provide backbone bandwidth for Internet
service providers
and content providers, says Stan Hanks, vice president of research and
technology at the
company.

At Level 3, falling backbone service prices would be good news, says spokesman
David Powers.
"We want to drive prices down by reducing the underlying cost of the network,"
he says. "We
think we can do it because we are building a green-field network that doesn't
have the cost of
legacy technology like circuit switches." Most other network operators are
looking to add services
to their mix, including Web hosting, to create a differentiated service. MCI
WorldCom through its
UUnet subsidiary, Frontier, Qwest and others have announced Web hosting
services.

Greater bandwidth and lower prices also will enable new video services to be
delivered over the
Internet, says Vab Goel, vice president of IP engineering and technology at
Qwest.

"One of the things Qwest is doing is building its own access rings in 25 major
markets," Goel says.
"We think this network will drive cost down and increase performance for
value-added
applications which can be delivered over an IP network. Today, most video is
compressed. With
faster access speeds, you can watch TV shows over the Internet. This becomes
interesting when
you talk about having access to any TV show broadcast anywhere around the
globe."

In addition to enabling new services, however, the sudden availability of
bandwidth will
dramatically change the way services are priced and sold.

"It's the next great challenge of the Internet - deciding how you are going to
bill customers and
what they will be willing to pay for," analyst Bernstein says. "I'm not sure
anyone knows yet."

Part of that challenge is matching a service that customers value with the 
need
to recover the high
costs of expanding a network.

"George Gilder likes to say that bandwidth will be free - well, putting in
20,000 channels of
OC-48 [2.5-Gbps transmision] isn't free; it costs billions," Sprint's Harris
says. "And the same
thing goes when you build up the local copper network to do DSL or cable
modems."

Already, however, DSL prices are dropping to $30 to $40 per month for a 
consumer
service that
offers up to 1.5 megabits per second. Businesses still typically pay $125 to
$400 per month for
higher-speed services that offer the same bandwidth in both upload and 
download
modes. That
compares very favorably to the $2,000 per month most companies paid for a T1
line until the past
two years.

But with customers assuming bandwidth will be cheap, how will nine backbone
network providers
recover their billions in investment?

"I don't have a crystal ball," says Nune at MCI. "With the access speeds going
up - whether it be
ADSL [Asymmetric DSL] or gigabit Ethernet - we anticipate many rich 
applications
to drive the
bandwidth of our customers."

Providing those applications - or at least building into the network the right
hooks for new services
- is the best hope for building a new revenue base, Harris agrees.

There will still be room for charging higher rates as well for levels of
reliability and transmission
speeds, says Qwest's Goel, but those charges will likely be packaged as part 
of
the application
cost.

In a world where everyone has access to the same technology, it will be the
business issues that
ultimately decide who succeeds at building - and sustaining - the backbone of
the next Internet.

Dax,

A deal just came up with the California ISO (a confederation of utilities 
that operate their power grid).  I have attached several emails under this 
describing it.  What I'd like is either Fuzz or Rob to work with you on 
enumerating this opportunity.  As I see it, the deal hinges on our bid for 
their circuits.  Dan Minter and his team are evaluating them and will get 
back to you so you can get prices from the traders.

Dax:  I need you to be the coordinator on this one.  Please call Dan first 
thing in the morning to discuss the circuit side.  Then think about the 
financial structure a bit.  I'll be in Thursday and we can work on it then.  

This is a very well teed up opportunity.  The customer has excellent credit, 
they told us how much money they need to save from their current agreement, 
and they are desperate to deal.  This should be priority #1 now.  As for 
output, we'll need a simple spreadsheet model and four or five slides by 
Friday detailing the structure we are proposing.  Remember that the 
counterparty is not very finance savvy; so we need to make this one simple.

Call me tomorrow morning on my cell phone to discuss.

Brian





Initial Background Stuff

The Network
MCI built the system.
The ISO currently shares its private, dedicated network 50-50 with the 
California Power Exchange, though the ISO would like to take control of 100% 
of the asset.
Network currently operating at about 1/2 capacity.
The current network consists of 4 OC-12s.  (As part of the contract, the ISO 
has a call to upgrade to 4 OC-48s.)
This "scalability" was built in to accommodate what California believed would 
be a very large and rapidly growing number of users (mostly scheduling 
coordinators), but California greatly over-estimated the number.  So the ISO 
is left with a lot of excess capacity.
About 1/2 the capacity is currently used by the PX, but the ISO would like to 
terminate that relationship as quickly as possible (if possible).
It's an ATM switched network with 11 A-PoPs and 4 B-Pops and it runs from 
Folsom (Sacramento) to Alhambra (around Pasadena).  The B-PoP locations are 
Hayward, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Claremont.

The Contract
The ISO pays about $30-35 million/yr under the contract---significantly out 
of the money.
The contract ends at the end of 2003.
The contract apparently includes a costless, or very low cost, option to 
upgrade from OC-12 to OC-48.
The contract also permits interconnection to the network (by MCI) for $485, 
irrespective of distance (for customers interconnecting in order to play in 
the ISO, I assume).  Access to the network is defined as DS1.

The Goals of the ISO's EVP/CIO
Desperate to reduce costs immediately.   Needs to take a plan designed to 
mitigate the costs to his Board by the end of June.
Wants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows.
"Would like to do a short term deal, for "nonfirm" service and get  a high 
price," but would do a long-term, firm deal if it reduced his costs 
significantly.

Next Steps
Get info we need from the ISO to put together a couple of possible solutions.
Meet with EVP/CIO by end of next week to present the options.

Proposed Questions for the ISO
How much money do they want to save?
In our meeting, the CIO said he wanted to unwind the deal that the PX has for 
half of the network capacity.  That happened yet?  Going to happen soon?
How much would it cost to have MCI upgrade the system to OC-48? How long 
would it take?
Do they have a detailed map of the network they could provide us?


Further Details

The woman who manages the MCI contract (Michelle Windmillercalled me 
yesterday and told me the following:

The option in the contract is for additional OC-12 circuits.
The cost per circuit is $11,400/circuit---Dan, does this price make sense to 
you? (They have NO idea if that price is in the money.)
Takes 22 days to install incremental circuit w/o MCI router.
Takes 30 days w/MCI router.
The contract does not limit the number of incremental circuits that the ISO 
can demand from MCI. 
The EVP/CIO's target for savings is $5MM/year.  (Recall that they are 
currently paying $30-35MM/year.)
The are open to us financing a buyout, but prefer to outsource the entire 
network to us and share in the savings.
Michelle wants us to help them understand exactly what the nature of the 
product is that they're sitting on and if there's a market for it.  MCI's 
telling them that there ain't no market for what they've got.  They want our 
view.
Michelle thinks that folks at the ISO are still under the illusion that 
they're sitting on a superhighway when they really have a country road.  She 
wants us to help re-orient their thinking.
They need to meet pronto because the EVP/CIO has to give the ISO Board a 
"progress report" next Thursday.  On the basis of the meeting that Dan and I 
had with them some time back, the EVP apparently went to the last Board 
meeting and told the Board that he was actively working on a potential 
solution and would report back at the upcoming meeting.
Michelle wants to meet on Monday, but we have conflicts, so I have left her a 
message saying that it needs to be on Tuesday morning.

BY MAX SMETANNIKOV  InterActive Week 11.1.99


Idea is to build on streaming content delivery 

While Akamai Technologies and recently acquired Sandpiper Net-works have 
captured the majority of mind share as leaders in the emerging content 
distribution market, Enron Communications is making a bid to blend together 
its assets as a national carrier to beat back the start-ups and make some 
major waves in the content delivery business.
Last week, Portland, Ore.-based carrier Enron (www.enron.net) announced it 
has broadened its content distribution network to focus on streaming media. 
The intensified pursuit of the content distri-bution space is likely to come 
as a surprise to com-petitors that perceive the carrier as more of a 
band-width wholesaler.
However, company executives say content distri-bution ofvarious kinds is what 
Enron is all about.
"What we do is exactly what they [Aka-mai]  do," says Joe Hirko, Enron 
president and chief executive. "The difference is that their   services   are 
acceptable for some    content, that isn't mis-sion-cntical, and we have that 
same model and we do that for mis-sion-crincal content."
Just like Akamai and Sandpiper,  Enron  is colocating its media dis-tribution 
servers with other Internet service providers (ISPs), mem-bers of the 
so-called e-Powered  Distribution Program, making it possible for Enron to 
reserve bandwidth on partners' networks. The differentiator that Enron brings 
to the table is its quality-of-service guarantee, backed by an elaborate 
network architecture and business model that Enron is building, which relies 
on a combination of alliances and a bandwidth broker exchange.
First, Enron has built its own content distribution network with servers 
colocated with other ISPs. These carriers include Epoch Internet, Electric 
Lightwave, FlashNet Communications, GTE Inte-networking, InterNap, NetRail, 
NorthPoint Communications, RCN and Veno. Enron is also pursuing satellite 
providers as another group of carriers capa-ble of distributing content in 
geographically remote places where fiber networks are not present yet.
While traditional content distributors measure their footprint in servers 
distributed with other hackhones, Enron uses its points of presence and the 
number ofdesktops reached as its basic metrics. Enron says it can shoot audio 
and video streams to 25 million desktops via 500 POPs.
Second, Enron is in the final stages of establishing its own bandwidth 
exchange, a division that would trade space on other carriers networks as a 
way to provision bandwidth on demand. Hirko says six interconnection points 
for carriers that want to trade on this exchange have been built, and the 
first trades will start before the end of the year.
This would be the first time a bandwidth exchange business model, in itself a 
nascent idea, would be married to content distribution as the means to bring 
down the cost of streaming media distribution.
"This is something completely new. I have not seen anything like this," says 
Tim Strong, an analyst at consultancy TeleGeography in Washington, D.C.
The result is essentially complete control over the pipe delivering voice and 
video, a position of power that Hirko says will lead to unmatched 
performance. "We are talking 27 frames a second," Hirko says, adding that it 
is not uncommon to tap into streaming video feeds as low as two or three 
frames per second.
Enron plans to charge its users less than 5 cents per megabyte delivered.
Akamai (www.akamai.com), which doesn't own its own network and uses the 
Internet as the means of streaming media delivery, also plans to guarantee
near-zero packet loss with its patent-pending, yet-to-be-launched service 
called Steady Stream.
The biggest challenge for Enron is to convince potential customers that the 
carrier is more than simply a bandwidth provider. To date, Enron's only 
public streaming media client is CountryCool.com.
Enron officials see an opportunity to barge into the industry by 
commandeering the unconquered segment of the content distribution market 
streaming media  where Akamai and Sandpiper have yet to make a name.
"We are using Akamai for distribution of objects and static images," says 
Monty Mullig, vice president of CNN Internet Technologies. "It's possible 
Akamai might work for streaming media, but I have not seen that product from 
them yet." CNN Interactive is distributing most of its video through Intervu, 
one of the first providers of streaming media services.
While Mullig is intrigued by the prospects of Enron's bandwidth exchange 
services, he has yet to be convinced the company offers a compeffing service.
"They haven't put a product in front of us that we would be interested in," 
Mullig says. "We want a big audience behind the service that we buy  like 
Akamai's. On its face value, Enron's network is not any more interesting than 
networks of other players their size.

The master plan
National carrier Enron cites four building blocks as the foundation for its 
content distribution service:
NETWORK COVERAGE: 12-POP-strong national network and partner agreements with 
10 ISPs worldwide - a content distribu-tion network reaching 25 million end 
users
INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE: Enron Intelligent Network, which ties together various 
network properties for a quality-of-service-enabled offering

BANDWIDTH EXCHANGE SERVICE: Soon to be launched, will provide spot capacity 
on other carriers' networks on an on-demand basis

APPLICATION PARTNERS: Vendors and service providers enabling applications 
delivered through Enron's network

(Copyright (c) 1999, PR Newswire) 



HOUSTON, Nov. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Communications, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Enron (NYSE: ENE), and Inktomi Corporation (Nasdaq: INKT) 
announced today a strategic alliance in which the Inktomi Traffic Server 
cache platform will be integrated into the Enron Intelligent Network to offer 
high quality network performance and bandwidth capacity to support broadband 
content distribution and e-business services. The integration of Inktomi's 
caching software into the Enron Intelligent Network enhances Enron 
Communications' ability to seamlessly and selectively push content to the 
desktop while handling massive volumes of high bit rate network traffic in a 
scalable manner. 


"With the acceleration of global e-business demands, there is an increased 
need for an Internet infrastructure that is scalable, reliable and fast," 
said David Peterschmidt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Inktomi 
Corp." The integration of our Traffic Server technology into the Enron 
Intelligent Network will enable a rich suite of broadband applications and 
services targeted at the next generation of content delivery."


The enhanced performance of the Enron Intelligent Network, in combination 
with the Inktomi Traffic Server cache platform, lies in its ability to store 
content "one-hop" away from the user at the closest ISP server. Enron's 
network also provides greater scaling capability to handle peaks in demand 
without system failures. In contrast, the public Internet has a limited 
capability to deliver broadband services like streaming media, which is often 
hampered by packet loss, interference, and other disruptions that slow down 
transmission speed and compromise the end user viewing experience. 


"Enron Communications' unique e-business platform includes industrial 
strength routers and servers, combined with fiber and satellite distribution, 
to deliver more simultaneous streams which overcomes the challenges of the 
current Internet," said Mike Ortega, vice president of sales at InterNAP. 
"Integrating Inktomi's technology with the Enron Intelligent Network really 
takes our services to a new level and provides a huge competitive advantage 
in the delivery of broadband content to our customers." 


The integration of Inktomi technology with the Enron Intelligent Network will 
represent an industry-best end-to-end solution to deliver mission critical 
applications to vertical industries like financial services and media and 
entertainment. For example, the Enron Intelligent Network can host high- 
quality streaming video road shows for the financial services industry -- 
distributed live, interactive and on-demand. The Enron Intelligent Network 
offers investment banks, content aggregators and other financial entities a 
richer, faster and more reliable audio/video experience for their audiences 
than today's popular solutions, which are mostly public Internet based. 


"Enterprise businesses are looking for the right combination of technology 
that will enable their swift transformation to e-businesses, which is what 
the Enron Intelligent Network offers. We offer the end-to-end Internet 
solution for content distribution, not just a small enhancement to the public 
Internet," said Joe Hirko, president and CEO of Enron Communications. "The 
enterprise seeks online services like TV-quality streaming rich media, video 
conferencing over the Internet, and large video file transfers over IP, which 
are transmitted with even higher quality and reliability over the Enron 
Intelligent Network with the support of Inktomi caching." 


One of Enron Communications' streaming customers -- Countrycool.com, the 
official web cast site of the 1999 Country Music Association (CMA) Awards -- 
transmitted a live stream of the 33rd Annual CMA Awards over the Enron 
Intelligent Network. The viewing audience connected to the stream at 
broadband speeds of 150 Kbps and 300 Kbps. High-bit rate, data-intensive 
streaming media events, like the CMA Awards web cast, highlight the efficient 
delivery and robust performance of the Enron Intelligent Network. 


"We realized that Enron Intelligent Network was the perfect platform for the 
most efficient and reliable delivery of our premier streaming event, and in 
fact, they exceeded our expectations. The quality of this stream got such 
excellent reviews that our web site audience has increased by nearly 900 
percent over last year's numbers," said Carol Walcoff, Countrycool.com 
President and CEO. "Now add Inktomi's caching technology to Enron 
Communications' platform and we truly are able to scale our services and meet 
our increased user requests for on-demand content."

Description:	Is Latest Fiber Optic Play Enron?
Detail:	
Dow Jones News Service  2/3/00

Investors can't get enough fiber. And we're not talking about a bowl of 
Cheerios or Special K. 

 We're talking about fiber optics. 

 Telecommunications companies such as Qwest Communications (QWST), Global 
Crossing (GBLX) and Level 3 Communications
 (LVLT) are racing to build new fiber-optic networks so that high-bandwidth 
applications like video can travel faster and be clearer when
 they reach the desktop. The huge growth of the Internet has increased the 
need for more capacity on old fiber and copper wire
 networks. All sorts of new switches, routers, servers and software are being 
used to build the new networks and beef up the old ones. 

 The need for fiber and gadgets that enhance networks prompted Corning (GLW) 
- that erstwhile dishmaker - to announce Thursday that
 it will spend $750 million to increase its fiber-optics manufacturing 
capacity by 50% over the next few years. And the trend has sent
 stocks like JDS Uniphase (JDSU), SDL (SDLI) and Sycamore Networks (SCMR) 
through the roof. 

 The excitement over fiber optics and increasing bandwidth is also juicing up 
shares of an old natural gas and electric company called
 Enron (ENE). True, Enron isn't a typical energy or utility company: The 
Houston-based company is known for leading the charge of
 wholesale marketing and trading of gas and electricity. But Enron has never 
been considered a telecommunications company. 

 Until now. 

 After trading between $28.75 and $44.875 last year, Enron shares shot up 65% 
to a new high of $73.06 last month, after the company
 held its annual analysts' conference where it unveiled its new 
communications strategy and a surprising joint venture with Sun
 Microsystems (SUNW). Wall Street was smitten. "Although this is still an 
energy company, in our view, Enron fits the description of a
 'new economy' stock" because it has moved its wholesale trading operations 
online and announced a unique broadband strategy, wrote
 Donato Eassey, a Wall Street Journal All-Star analyst at Merrill Lynch. 

 Enron has been building its broadband business since 1997, when it acquired 
Portland General Electric, which started building a
 fiber-optic network. Enron invited both telecom analysts and the usual 
contingent of natural gas analysts to its Jan. 20 meeting. The
 company presented its new network, which is based on fiber; servers that are 
ramps on and off the network; "pooling points," which are
 essentially switches that connect its network to other networks; and 
software to control the transmission of data. The company is using
 networking gear mostly from Lucent Technology (LU) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). 
By the end of 2001, Enron expects to increase its
 network to 18,000 miles from about 13,000 miles now - a sizeable slice of 
the roughly 200,000 miles of fiber in the U.S. 

 The company also announced a joint venture with Sun Microsystems to develop 
a standard technology for accessing real-time
 bandwidth and supply Enron with 18,000 servers. With Sun CEO Scott McNealy 
at their side, Enron executives said Sun will purchase
 broadband video streaming services from Enron. "All we can say is WOW!" 
wrote Edward Tirello Jr. at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in
 a note after the show. "Just when we began to ponder the potential with a 
very healthy skepticism, Enron brilliantly anticipated the
 reaction and thrust Sun Microsystems' billionaire CEO Scott McNealy into the 
mix." 

 Fund managers have been intrigued by Enron's transformation, too. Back in 
December, the Janus Fund (JANSX) snapped up 15.6
 million shares of Enron, bringing its stake to more than 25.5 million shares 
and making it by far the largest holder of the stock, according
 to the latest monthly data from Morningstar. And Fidelity's huge Magellan 
(FMAGX) fund nearly doubled its stake in Enron to 4.6
 million shares in December. Says Marion Schultheis, managing director at J. 
& W. Seligman, who owns the stock in two growth funds
 and is looking to buy more: "Now there are real tech people looking at 
Enron." 

 Analysts think Enron's stock can climb even higher. "In January, it was just 
the first step of the market realizing what this company is
 doing," says Erik Ruben, an analyst at Janus Capital. "It is such an 
extraordinary story." Wall Street Journal All-Star analyst Rick Gross
 at Lehman Brothers agrees. The natural gas analyst is quick to point out 
that the stock is also reflecting strength in Enron's wholesale gas
 and electric business and the company's success in turning its energy 
services business profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter. 

 Enron plans to use its network in two ways. The first business is bandwidth 
intermediation, which involves using its own network and
 other networks to provide businesses and Internet service providers with 
full bandwidth needs. Enron aims to lower the cost of using
 networks by charging customers for only the time and space they use on the 
network. Right now, customers that need space on a
 network have to enter long-term contracts for preset amounts of capacity 
with major telecommunications providers such as AT&T (T)
 and MCI WorldCom (WCOM). Enron has also developed a standard bandwidth 
contract that pools existing contracts or unused
 capacity that can be traded in a marketplace (see story for more). 

 Basically, the company plans to make money on the spread between buying and 
selling prices for bandwidth, along with financing
 services. The company has already proved it can profitably buy and sell 
natural gas and electricity contracts in the same manner. Ronald
 Barone at PaineWebber figures that the bandwidth intermediation business 
will generate gross operating income of more than $500
 million in 2004, from an estimated $9 million this year. 

 The second business is providing broadband content services such as video 
conferencing and streaming. The company is using its own
 messaging software (acquired from a company called Modulus), along with 
Inktomi (INKT) caching software to control distribution of
 content across its network and RealNetworks' (RWNK) video streaming 
software. It is also using switch routers that control data flows
 made by a privately held company called Avici Systems. The company expects 
to generate content revenue of $2.5 billion in 2004, up
 from an estimated $45 million this year, according to Barone. 

 The whole broadband services unit is expected to spend $650 million and lose 
$60 million (before interest and taxes) this year, Barone
 says. But right now, the stock is hardly reflecting this business, says 
Lehman's Gross. "The non-broadband business is valued at $55 to
 $60, so there's very little in the stock for its broadband assets," he says. 
Many analysts have raised their 12-month stock price targets to
 $90 to $100, giving Enron's broadband business a value of $30 to $40 a 
share. 

 Enron's broadband strategy is catching a lot of attention, but some of the 
established telecom companies, such as MCI WorldCom
 (WCOM), doubt that it will be successful. Still, Global Crossing, which was 
the first to sell bandwidth between New York and Los
 Angeles to Enron in December, has indicated that it thinks the bandwidth - 
trading concept can work. It's just a question of when.
 "Enron is going to be a winner in bandwidth trading ," agrees Brad Bradshaw, 
senior director at the Yankee Group. "It's going to take
 a while, though." 

 Even if the broadband plans don't work out, Enron has a thriving energy 
business to fall back on. The company owns gas pipelines, sells
 wholesale gas and electricity in North America both traditionally and online 
and manages energy needs for large companies such as
 Chase Manhattan (CMB) and Simon Property Group (SPG). Says Janus' Ruben. 
"Its energy businesses are equally
 paradigm-breaking."

Scott:

Just to follow up on my e-mail and voice mail messaged to you:  language that 
would have barred internet companies from obtaining the licenses to transmit 
movies, sporting events and other broadcast programs was DROPPED from H.R. 
1554, the satellite TV bill (which is attached to H.R. 3194, the omnibus 
appropriations legislation).

Please see the CQ article below for more information on the legislation in 
general.   We will certainly continue to watch for language like this that 
might surface in future legislation.   In the context of ECI's larger 
legislative agenda, we may also want to explore the potential to develop 
legislation that would pro-actively ensure the broadcast of licensed 
programming over the internet.

Cheers,

Jeff

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: SATELLITE BILL SURVIVES A SCARE, CARRIES OTHER MEASURES 
WITH IT 
By Alan K. Ota, CQ Staff Writer 

Nov. 18, 1999 - The uproar in the Senate Thursday over deletion of a loan 
guarantee program designed to improve rural television service nearly 
obscured the significance of the satellite television bill that was linked to 
the fiscal 2000 omnibus spending bill (HR3194). 

The controversial provision would have created a new Agriculture Department 
program to guarantee $1.25 billion in loans enabling satellite providers to 
transmit local programming to rural subscribers -- service they insist is too 
expensive to provide without help. It was added to the satellite TV bill 
(HR1554) in conference but dropped when the final version (S1948) was 
referenced in HR3194.

Rural-state senators led by Max Baucus, R-Mont., blocked action on a stopgap 
funding bill (HJRES82) until leaders promised them a floor vote on the loan 
guarantee legislation or similar provisions by next April 1.

Also dropped from the final bill was language that would haved barred 
Internet service providers from obtaining the licenses necessary to transmit 
movies, sports events and other broadcast programming. Cable and satellite 
providers would be the only entities with such licenses. America Online and 
other companies lobbied furiously to strip the provision.

The final measure would for the first time allow satellite companies to beam 
local news, sports, weather and other broadcast programming to all of their 
customers, just as cable providers do.

And it would grant a reprieve to more than a million satellite subscribers 
now receiving local channels who otherwise would lose those signals by year's 
end. A court had ruled the subscribers do not qualify to receive local 
signals by satellite under current law.

Satellite companies would have to gain permission from local broadcast 
stations within six months after they begin retransmitting those signals.

By Jan. 1, 2002, satellite carriers that transmit local channels would have 
to carry all of the channels in that community, a "must-carry" requirement 
already imposed on cable providers.

The measure would extend for five years the licenses under which satellite 
companies retransmit the signals of superstations and distant network 
stations and reduce the copyright fees they must pay.

The bill would generally retain existing standards for determining which 
subscribers are eligible to receive distant network signals by satellite, but 
it would require the Federal Communications Commission to review its model 
for determining which areas are unable to receive acceptable-quality 
broadcast signals over the air.

Like the conference report on HR1554, the final satellite bill carries a 
number of pieces of unrelated legislation.

* Patent Overhaul. In a victory for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin 
G. Hatch, R-Utah, negotiators included a patent system overhaul bill (HR1907) 
that was strongly opposed by some inventors and by the Eagle Forum, a 
conservative group headed by political activist Phyllis Schlafly, who argued 
that it would permit foreign companies to steal American technology.

The bill would require publication of some patent applications, which have 
been filed both in the United States and abroad, within 18 months of filing, 
whether or not patents have been granted.

The measure also would require the Patent and Trademark Office to approve or 
reject a patent application within three years. It would provide patent term 
extensions for any not approved within that three-year period to guarantee 
investors a 17-year patent term. Currently, patents are for 20 years, but 
inventors often lose years waiting for approval of their applications.

* Low-Power TV Stations. The omnibus spending bill also included provisions 
of a bill (HR486) to create a new "Class A" license for low-power television 
stations equivalent to those granted to full-service "primary" stations.

The provisions are designed to help low-power stations that often provide 
"niche" programming in urban areas and local programming in rural areas 
become more stable and commercially viable.

* 'Cybersquatting.' The measure includes provisions of a bill (S1255) to bar 
unauthorized use of trademark-protected brand names in Internet addresses. 
The bill was passed by the Senate by voice vote Aug. 5; the House passed a 
different version Oct. 26.

* PBS Donor Lists. In response to disclosures earlier this year that some 
public broadcast stations had exchanged donor lists with political parties -- 
and primarily with Democratic Party units -- negotiators included a provision 
to prohibit such stations from sharing their donor lists with political 
parties. It also would bar disclosure of its donors to any non-affiliated 
group without the donor's consent. Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., had introduced 
legislation (HR2791) earlier this year to prohibit the list-sharing, but the 
bill did not advance.

service delivery side of the organization to enable us to be successful in=
=20
executing on our=20
     strategy. =20

It is with these goals in mind that we make following modifications to the=
=20
organization.  An organization chart for both EBS global and EBS Europe is=
=20
attached which details all departmental reporting relationships.  Some of t=
he=20
more significant changes are discussed below:

Commercial Coverage

We remain convinced that we must focus our efforts on customers rather than=
=20
products in order to be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in the=
=20
rapidly evolving broadband marketplace.  Further, while our service offerin=
gs=20
can still be broadly defined as intermediation and/or content services, our=
=20
marketing approach toward enterprise customers must differ substantially fr=
om=20
that of our media and entertainment content customers. =20

We also are more likely to offer bundled solutions combining both streaming=
=20
and/or bandwidth products to the enterprise segment, while our streaming=20
platform is forefront in the minds of our media and content customers.  In=
=20
addition, there is significant potential for integrated transactions among=
=20
the Enterprise, Technology Partners, and ASP/ISV customer segments.  To=20
capture the tremendous opportunities these customer bases provide, we have=
=20
segmented our customer coverage functions into three groups:=20

Content and Distribution Services will be led by David Cox and will focus i=
ts=20
efforts intensely on aggregating high bandwidth content and ensuring high=
=20
quality delivery through its Broadband Distribution Partner (BDP) customer=
=20
base.  Stewart Seeligson will join David Cox to provide day-to-day manageme=
nt=20
of our efforts in this area.  David will continue to focus on large=20
commercial opportunities and provide commercial direction over the deployme=
nt=20
of our streaming platform.  Stewart will focus on driving the commercial=20
activities of the group.  April Hodgson and Steve Luginbill will report to=
=20
Stewart.  In addition, due to the scale of efforts required to make the=20
Blockbuster agreement a success, we have formed a Video on Demand (VOD) tea=
m=20
consisting of cross-functional expertise.  This team is led by Frank Bay, w=
ho=20
also reports to David Cox. =20

Enterprise/ASP will be led jointly by Jim Crowder and Rex Shelby, and will=
=20
focus on providing bundled solutions to this rapidly evolving business=20
marketplace.  In addition, this group will continue to be responsible for o=
ur=20
key strategic relationships.   =20

The Wholesale Group, led by Ted Seitz, will continue to focus its coverage=
=20
efforts on the traditional telecom sectors of carriers, ISP=01,s, CLEC=01,s=
, RBOC=01,
s, global carriers and transcontinental capacity providers located in the=
=20
U.S. and Canada.

EBS Europe

Unlike many of Enron=01,s traditional businesses, the communications busine=
ss is=20
truly global in nature.  Therefore, it is essential that we extend ourselve=
s=20
internationally in areas where we can leverage our existing network and ski=
ll=20
sets.  We feel that the European region now presents significant=20
opportunities to EBS, and we are pleased to announce that Steve Elliott,=20
former head of Network Development, will be moving to London as President o=
f=20
EBS Europe to head up this effort.  Joining Steve in London will be Kevin=
=20
Kohnstamm as VP of Network and Business Implementation. =20

Steve=01,s former responsibilities will be shared by: Ted Seitz, who will=
=20
oversee the development of the network domestically from a commercial=20
perspective, as well as manage our Canadian initiatives; Jon Thomsen who wi=
ll=20
consolidate our Latin American activities in Mexico and South America.  We=
=20
will also be consolidating all of our Asian activities into one group, whos=
e=20
leadership we will announce shortly.  In addition, we are pleased to announ=
ce=20
that Raj Thapar has now joined us from Enron India.  Raj will manage all of=
=20
EBS=01, activities in India, where he will work closely with the Enron Indi=
a=20
team headed by Sanjay Bhatnagar.  Raj will report to Steve Elliott.

David Leatherwood and the Network Construction group will now report to Joh=
n=20
Griebling in John=01,s capacity as head of Network Engineering and Operatio=
ns.

Product Engineering

The rapidly evolving nature of the broadband streaming services business,=
=20
coupled with the robust capabilities of the EIN, provide EBS with almost=20
unlimited potential streaming application opportunities.  At the same time,=
=20
we must deliver on the capabilities of established products.  To balance th=
e=20
need for execution with the need to develop new products, we have segmented=
=20
the former Product Development group into two efforts: =20

Diane Hetzel will lead the newly named Product Engineering group, which is=
=20
charged with application development and deployment on our network of all=
=20
current EBS product offerings.  Diane will report to the Office of the=20
Chairman.  Also, Global Information Systems, managed by Laura Beneville, wi=
ll=20
now report to Diane.

John Bloomer will head the New Products and Technology group, which will=20
identify emerging product and technology opportunities with the goal of=20
eventual commercialization and integration into our product offering.  John=
=20
will report to Scott Yeager=01,s Strategic Development group.

Risk Management Systems

In order to succeed in developing a broad-based product offering that can=
=20
scale effectively, EBS must put in place an integrated state-of-the-art=20
transaction-processing platform.  This requires effective coordination of a=
ll=20
risk system development activities. =20

John Echols joins EBS as head of the new Risk Systems Development and Servi=
ce=20
Delivery group.  John brings a wealth of experience in transaction systems=
=20
development from Enron North America and Enron Energy Services.  To ensure=
=20
that we are developing appropriate risk reporting and customer service=20
capabilities to this effort, Barry Pearce and Penny Crane, who head these=
=20
respective functions, will report to John.  In addition, David Reece will=
=20
join John as Project Manager for all risk management systems=01, software=
=20
development.

Broadband Operating System (BOS)

The successful implementation of an Application Programming Interface (API)=
=20
for broadband applications remains a key component of EBS=01,s overall=20
strategy.  The ability of applications to have access to bandwidth capacity=
=20
on-demand is integral to the success of our network and the broadband=20
marketplace in general.  Larry Ciscon will continue in his role as Chief=20
Architect for the Broadband Operating System (BOS).  Everett Plante will=20
assume the role of Program Manager for BOS to provide the necessary linkage=
s=20
to the network architecture efforts of the EIN.

Structuring

A core competency of Enron has been its ability to identify, segment,=20
appropriately price and manage risks rigorously in emerging commodity=20
markets, while continuing to be flexible enough to rank by Fortune as the=
=20
most innovative company in America.  Across the company, an effective=20
structuring group with the proper representation of financial, technical an=
d=20
other assorted disciplines has been a key part of this success.  Towards th=
is=20
end, we have established the Structuring and Transaction Development group=
=20
under Brad Richter and Steve Barth. =20

We also have merged the Sales Engineering group, led by Merat Bagha into th=
e=20
structuring group to ensure the proper technical input for all potential=20
transactions.  It is essential that we support this group in its efforts by=
=20
allowing structuring to review all transactions emanating from the customer=
=20
coverage groups to ensure proper pricing, accountability, and documentation=
=20
of all related risks.  The efforts of this group are critical in establishi=
ng=20
the framework to allow our business to scale exponentially to meet the=20
accelerating demands of the broadband marketplace.

Trading and Risk Management

Jim Fallon, formerly Managing Director of Power Trading and Risk Management=
=20
for Enron North America, has joined EBS as head of Global Risk Management. =
=20
Jim and his team is charged with replicating the successful trading platfor=
m=20
he built in North America into a bandwidth trading platform for EBS.  Paul=
=20
Racicot, VP of Bandwidth Trading, will head the North America trading desk,=
=20
and Marcello Romano, Director of Bandwidth Trading, will head this function=
=20
in Europe, while reporting jointly to both Jim and Steve Elliott. .  As=20
previously announced, VP John Scoblick will head real estate risk, and IRU=
=20
Management, led by Andy Unverzagt, will also report to Jim.

Warpspeed Acquisition=20

We highlighted above the significance of the Warpspeed acquisition.  Terry=
=20
Stavropoulos, VP, Mike Golden, EBSS-CTO, and Andy Rundquist, architect, lea=
d=20
Enron Broadband Switching Systems, formerly Warpspeed.  We welcome the EBSS=
=20
team of 55 employees to the EBS team. =20

Staff Functions

Kelly Kimberly, formerly Senior VP of Marketing, Communication and PR for=
=20
Enron=01,s international companies, now leads that function for EBS as well=
 as=20
overseeing the Market Interface and Intelligence group, headed by VP Tony=
=20
Mends.  It is critical that our external message be consistent to ensure we=
=20
are communicating EBS=01, strategy effectively.  Toward this end, the marke=
ting=20
representatives, formerly in the verticals, will now report directly to Kel=
ly.

As was recently announced, Marla Barnard is now leading the HR function for=
=20
EBS.  We recognize that intellectual capital is our most important resource=
. =20
Marla will focus on keeping EBS competitive by developing strategies to=20
ensure that EBS is able to attract, develop and retain the best talent in t=
he=20
industry.

We are in a rapidly changing and dynamic industry. While our strategy and=
=20
overall objectives will remain unchanged, we must continue to be flexible o=
n=20
how we execute on our strategy and achieve our objectives to effectively=20
respond to the changing needs of our customers and to new opportunities in=
=20
the marketplace.  This requires timely modifications to our organization.  =
We=20
are convinced that we have a winning strategy and the best team in the worl=
d=20
to execute on our strategy.=20

While we have accomplished a great deal in the first six months of 2000, le=

remainder of the year.=20

Jeff:

Re Global Photon, I forgot to mention that they are also looking to acquire
a terrestrial system serving their key terminals.  Short term to allow them
to get up and running with customers, longer term they want dark fiber if
possible as a backup.  I think there is a lot of room for creative
structuring here.  The need for terrestrial could also be sectional, in that
one segment of the submarine system may be delayed behind others for
environmental purposes.

Hi Jim:

FYI. Lawyer's are taking a look at your proposed edits.  I'll let get in
touch as soon as I hear something.  And I got the Global Photon materials.
Thanks.

Scott--give me some guidance on how important or relevent this issue is for 
us so that I can get a better understanding of what I should/should not being 
spending time on.

The Minnesota PUC ruled yesterday the US West must open/share it's lines with 
competitors offering digital subscriber line (DSL) high speed interent 
access.  Apparently the order is the first for a state, but I understand that 
the FCC passed a similiar rule in the last month or so.  The Commission also 
ruled that USWest could charge an additional $6.00 for this access to their 
lines (in addition to the current rate of $18 that the customer pays) and 
that the DSL provider had the right to pass that charge on to the customer.  
The COmmission took a "soft" position on the $6.00, saying that they would 
review the amount of the charge over the next six months before making a 
final ruling on that specific issue.  I believe that this ruling came about 
due to an initial complaint by  a provider from Colorado.

I did not follow this case at all other than occassionally reading something 
about it. The major reason I did not was that I saw it as a "retail" access 
issue and I see our video streaming and bandwidth businesses as "wholesale" 
access/opportunity issues.  Certainly we always want to see open access and 
we want to see competitive parity, but I didn't see that our involvment 
and/or tracking of this proceeding was of great value.  Am I correct?

Kevin,

Pursuant to your request for a term sheet that would propose legislation to 
enable broadband access for every home and business in an attempt to bridge 
the digital divide, please see the attached document below.  The term sheet 
incorporates several federal solutions to funding a fiber or DSL build-out 
that will support high speed connectivity for residential and business 
premises, including a "take-back" of HDTV spectrum and subsequent auction 
thereof, as well as the establishment of individual tax credits or a 
"Broadband Buildout and Internet Access Trust Fund."

While the term sheet describes different opportunities for the government to 
endorse the build-out of last mile infrastructure, the federal solutions set 
forth do not have a high probability of enactment by the next congress.  
Thus, we are identifying additional means of promoting broadband access 
through state and municipal governments, as well as private initiatives.  We 
will forward a supplemental document to you in the coming weeks that 
describes additional avenues.  Perhaps we could meet at that time to discuss 
the full array of options.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts or comments.

Regards,

Lara

Jeff--my number changed last August, so it should be changed on your 
lists......#612-339-4599 (office)  #612-929-7669 (home)  #1-888-916-2264 
(pager)

I am traveling tonight and will be crazy tomorrow so if you could leave me 
the info via voice mail I'd appreciate it.  As I think I said in my message 
to you, I havn't been totally enthusiastic about anybody that I've 
interviewed in Chicago yet, so I wondered if the firm that you are using in 
California has an office in Chicago and if so, do they have a 
telecom/communications practice?  

Thanks a bunch.

Lara--I reviewed this report as well as the memo that Illinois counsel 
prepared for you.  A number of questions/concerns come to mind.  I briefly 
discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them 
before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. 

When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that 
the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into "regulatory" 
responsibilities vs "commercial" requirements.  In the regulatory column 
would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual 
identification of the CEO.  Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed 
every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart)  Other 
items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax 
contributions might fall into the commercial category.

These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but 
there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated 
with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.  And 
are there penalties in place if we don't comply?  

Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?

Attached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and 
CLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.  This project was meant to 
incorporate California and Florida; however, I have not yet received any 
information from our counsel in CA and I only received the pertinent 
information from our counsel in Florida late last night and this morning.  I 
apologize that I was not able to include any information from those states.  
I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation.

I have asked Gloria to provide some of you with copies of the material that I 
received from Florida  to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott).  
You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY.  

Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns.  Thank you.

Regards,

Lara

MR - This is the old draft from the Broadband "coalition" - the new one 
hasn't yet arrived and I want you to have something to forward to the Gov's 
office.  Make sure we can provide an updated version in the next week.  I 
don't anticipate many revisions from this version except for a stronger 
emaphasis on enforcement of Sec. 253 of the Telecom Act (dealing with 
barriers to entry).  Also, I'm uncomfortable with the draft language on 
state/munuicipal networks - it may go against our broader digital divide 
rhetoric.   We should portray this as the "Broadband Infrastructure 
Improvement Act of 2001" with the following goals:

1. Favor and encourage private  investment and private management of 
high-speed competitive broadband infrastructure and associated 
telecommunications and data services.  

2. Prohibit excessive state and local charges for high-speed broadband 
networks and competitive telecommunications and data services;

3. Continue to encourage that the content and commercial environment of the 
Internet remain free from unnecessary regulations or monopolistic policies; 
and

4. Encourage self-governance and public/private partnerships in addressing 
the issues of the Digital Divide.

Let's discuss in greater detail tomorrow in NY.  




ALL - EVERYONE'S COMMENTS/QUESTIONS ARE APPRECIATED.  We'll have a more 
detailed group meeting on this soon.  Thanks.

federal levels, as well as follow up with you on the issues raised on the 
Wasabi call with the DC lawyer. We'd like to get your input, as well as

OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA

EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E 
(about 800 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].  EES has natural gas 
customers within the territories PG&E and SoCal Gas.

Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada 
but only have 50 MW excess).  

We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in 
California or by transmitting power into the state.  Enron sells natural gas 
to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements.

Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by 
using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load 
shaping, and efficiency improvements.

Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&E.

OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGES

The current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result 
of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable 
retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model 
(for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the 
residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring 
direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' 
common costs). 

Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those 
naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against 
competition.  Enron disagrees.  What it proves is that not finishing the job 
of creating real competition can result in problems.  

Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for 
California.

In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly 
buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, 
(2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and 
(3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the 
Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy.

In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote 
retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to 
be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that 
the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove 
stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover 
wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to 
the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) 
California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop 
a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market 
volatility.

California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation 
assets or transmission facilities.  

California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which 
allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator.

KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA

We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be 
an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to 
creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF 
RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE].

The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.  Enron 
believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&E's and SCE's 
tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.  We filed 
a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.  We are confident that these funds 
will be recovered.  [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN 
AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE]

Hi Jeff,
Make sure the access to the network is defined as DS1 access...We would like 
DS3 access pricing because that is the minimum level of service we trade at 
today.  Also, please indicate that the current available capacity is about 1 
OC3, (the current OC12 network is running about half full and the ISO wants 
about an OC3 of overhead capacity with which to scale their customers' 
demand.  We need to determine the interval between the time the ISO requests 
the upgrade to OC48 from MCI and the time that upgrade would be made 
available...California OVER estimated the number of users...

Just a thought, but the ISO might be able to get MCI to reduce the Yearly fee 
they charge by waiving the right to the upgrade.  MCI would have to spend a 
significant amount of $ to do the upgrade.  Also, MCI is losing $ on those 
access loops.  If the ISO were to threaten to request 2000 loops that MCI was 
going to lose $100,000 per month on, MCI might reduce their charges if the 
ISO were to reduce the open call.

******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
**********
We have sent the attorney representing the ISO a standard EBS NDA to review.  
We expect to have the NDA signed within the week.  The following is a summary 
of what occured at the meeting.

The Network
MCI built the system.
The ISO currently shares its private, dedicated network 50-50 with the 
California Power Exchange, though the ISO like to take control of 100% of the 
asset.
The network consists of 4 OC-12s (?) and as part of the contract, the ISO has 
a call to upgrade an no or very little cost to 4 OC-48s.
This "scalability" was built in to accommodate what California believed would 
be a very large and rapidly growing number of users (mostly scheduling 
coordinators), but California greatly underestimated the number.  So the ISO 
is left with considerable excess capacity.
It's an ATM switched network with 11 A-PoPs and 4 B-Pops and it runs from 
Folsom (Sacramento) to Alhambra (around Pasadena).  The B-PoP locations are 
Hayward, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Claremont.

The Contract
The ISO pays about $30-35 million/yr under the contract---significantly above 
market.
The contract ends at the end of 2003.
The contract includes a costless, or very low cost, option to upgrade from 
OC-12 to OC-48.
The contract also permits interconnection to the network (by MCI) for $485, 
irrespective of difference from the grid.

The Goals of the EVP/CIO

Reduce costs immediately.   Needs to take a plan designed to mitigate the 
costs to the Board in 60 days.
Wants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows.
"Would like to do a short term deal, for "nonfirm" service and get  a high 
price," but he would do a long-term, firm deal if it reduced his costs 
significantly.

Fiber Optic Network Gets Hung Up on Indian Graveyard 
Posted December 20, 1999 04:00 AM PST 
California officials have slapped a stop-work order on one company's effort 
to wire the state with fiber optic cable, saying the project may be 
threatening traditional Indian burial grounds. Peter Allen, a lawyer for the 
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), said Friday that Denver-based 
Qwest Communications International Inc.had been instructed to pull its 
construction teams from the field pending resolution of the issue.
"They need to show that they are following the proper procedures and not 
going through any actual Indian burial sites,'' Allen said. The stop work 
order was issued Thursday after local Ohlone Indians spotted a Qwest 
construction crew digging a trench near a well-known tribal burial ground in 
San Jose, California.
"They should have known it was there. It was a recorded site,'' Larry Myers, 
executive secretary of the state's Native American Heritage Commission, told 
the San Jose Mercury News.
The 1,000-year old graveyard was unearthed a decade ago, and has been called 
one of the most important ever found in northern California, providing 
valuable clues about the Ohlone diet, health and social structure long before 
the arrival of European explorers. While the construction crew was operating 
several blocks from the grave site itself, state officials generally consider 
such areas to be surrounded by a "sensitive area'' of up to half a mile 
because bones and artifacts can moved by underground streams and shifting 
soil.
For Qwest, the order means that construction and repair work must stop for up 
to two months in California, an important part of its 24,500 mile network of 
fiber optic cable around the United States. "We're trying to meet this 
aggressively and head on,'' said Qwest spokesman Matt Burkett, adding that 
the stop work order applied only to actual physical installations and would 
not effect the company's existing service.
"We want to be sensitive to whatever issues (Native American groups) have and 
get a resolution that is fair to everyone as soon as possible.'' As part of 
its moves to address the issue, Qwest asked an Ohlone activist to serve as a 
paid monitor at the San Jose construction site.
Allen said the order against Qwest was the latest in a series of actions 
against telecommunications firms which Indian heritage preservation groups 
say are flouting environmental laws and measure designed to preserve 
archeological sites. Other telecoms firms that have been hit with temporary 
stop work orders in the past include Level 3 Communications, Pacific Fiber 
Link and Metromedia Fiber Network , which have been asked to stop 
installation work for periods ranging from six weeks to six months.
Allen said the Public Utilities Commission was concerned that upgrade plans 
within the intensely competitive telecommunications industry could lead to 
more environmental and historical sites being endangered by rampant and 
unsupervised construction.
"There's a lot of competition and a lot of competitive pressure. A lot of 
people are out there building as fast as they can,'' Allen said. "It's tough 
to balance the need to meet the demand for this telecoms infrastructure with 
the need to do an adequate environmental review.''

Fellas, please read below.  Do we have a need for extra capacity in 
California?  Mitch, could this be a re-sell opportunity?  Let me know if this 
is at all attractive.  Thanks.

Greetings Scott:
As we discussed, an acquaintance of mine is a lawyer whose client is the
California Independent System Operator (ISO).  The ISO contracted with MCI (a
couple of years ago) to build a broad band network ( OC-48) to support
electricity deregulation in California.  (Friends of mine at MCI worked on the
deal.) Since that time, the ISO has discovered that it has capacity
substantially in excess of what it needs to operate the grid (and certain
markets for power, e.g., ancillary services).  The ISO is none to happy about
having been sold an "overbuild" network by MCI.

But given MCI's reputation, the ISO is looking at marketing the capacity 
rather
than trying to re-negotiate the contract with MCI.  Sounds like the capacity
runs between Sacramento (Folsom?) and Southern California (Alhambra?).    
Could
be an opportunity for ECI to get some quality capacity at a substantial
discount.  I've let Tom Gros know about it, too (bandwidth trading
opportunity?).  Please pass along to ECI folks for their assessment.

Best,
Jeff

SB 1217 is sponsored by GTE.  AOL was initially a big supporter, but
with their recent merger they will probably will not maintain that
position.  The bill is sitting in the Assembly Utilities Committee with
no hearing date, probably due to Assemblyman Rod Wright's contempt for
the notion of open access.  I will fax you both a copy of a memorandum I
sent to Scott Bolton on October 28 explaining my point further.
According to Senator Alarcon's office, they do intend to bring the bill
up, but not until much later in the session.

Scott

Largest Classroom
Detail:	
Business Wire  3/1/00

England's Prime Minister Tony Blair part of 16-hour Global Leap video 
conference with U.S. astronauts, thousands of children and others 

PictureTel Corporation (Nasdaq: PCTL) has created the world's largest 
classroom, bringing American astronauts face-to-face with schoolchildren, 
mathematicians and others in a worldwide educational video conference. For 
Global Leap - a 16-hour distance-learning event - PictureTel furnished 
technical support and video streaming over the Internet via Enron Broadband 
Services' ePowered Media Cast(TM). 

Presented jointly with Slough, England's Arbour Vale School, classroom 
sessions included live, interactive "virtual field trips," where children can 
talk to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, astronauts at the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), divers at the Great Barrier 
Reef, mathematicians at Cambridge University, game wardens in South Africa 
and others around the world. Up to 20 learning sites were involved in each 
session, while 3,000 more participated via Internet video streaming. 

The event also marked the launch of www.Global-Leap.com, an online directory 
of educational videoconference links for schools. 

Global Leap 2000 was organized by Arbour Vale teacher Mike Griffith, who 
noted: "The Internet and other communications technology are making the world 
smaller by the second. That's why education must become more global in focus. 
Global Leap 2000 demonstrates the educational value of videoconferencing, and 
shows how technology breaks down cultural barriers by bringing students and 
others to places they may never otherwise experience." 

PictureTel, the world leader in video-based communications, has provided full 
technical support for the event, including the "electronic bridge" that 
connected thousands of children worldwide, through fully interactive 
videoconferencing. In addition, PictureTel's Enterprise Services Division 
made the event available to thousands more, through streaming video over the 
Internet. 

"Global Leap 2000 demonstrates the vast potential that distance-learning 
holds for students of any level," said Dr. Norman Gaut, PictureTel's chairman 
and chief executive officer. "By bringing interesting subjects from around 
the world inside the classroom - and allowing real-time interaction - Arbour 
Vale School enabled PictureTel to show that any obstacle to communication can 
be overcome."

Not too much.  ISO has been focusing on getting control over all of the
capacity, and I have been pointing out that the clock is ticking and that we
should deal with the large chunk we already have.  I have a call later this
week, so we'll see.  I believe they remain interested in reducing their
costs by offloading this.

Glossary of Communications Terms 
  
01/15/2001 
PC Magazine from ZDWire 
Copyright (c) 2001 ZD Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
Attenuation The decrease in a signal's power from transmission to reception. 
The received signal is lower in power because of such factors as line 
resistance, distance and network configuration.
Backbone The part of the network used as the main path for carrying traffic 
between network endpoints. 
CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) An LEC that competes with the 
incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) in a given market. A company may be 
the ILEC in one market and CLEC in another.
CO (central office) A telephone company facility serving a specific area. One 
or more phone lines run from a subscriber's home or office to a CO.
Crosstalk Interference on analog lines created by cables that are too close 
together. Crosstalk may produce static, buzzing, or multiple conversations on 
one line.
Digital loop carrier Equipment used to concentrate many local-loop pairs onto 
a few high-speed digital pairs or one fiber-optic pair for transport back to 
the central office. DLC systems reduce wiring cost.
DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) A relatively new 
industry standard defining how cable modems communicate over cable TV lines. 
Any DOCSIS modem will work on any DOCSIS-compatible cable data network.
DSL (digital subscriber line) A technology that provides high-speed, two-way 
data communications over analog phone lines. DSL operates on a higher 
frequency and doesn't interfere with existing phone service. The most widely 
deployed variety is ADSL (asymmetric DSL), which provides downstream speeds 
of 144 Kbps to 2.2 Mbps and upstream channels from 90 to 640 Kbps, depending 
on the distance from the CO. See HDSL, IDSL, SDSL, and VDSL.
ELEC (enterprise local exchange carrier) A corporation operating as its own 
LEC to obtain better carrier rates. An ELEC may sell services to other 
carriers from a separate profit center.
Firewall Software or hardware that filters or blocks traffic from a public or 
private network, preventing unauthorized or unrecognized access.
G.Lite An ITU standard for DSL technology that delivers 1.5 Mbps downstream. 
Pronounced "gee-dot-lite."
HDSL (high-bit-rate digital subscriber line) A flavor of DSL that delivers up 
to 1.544 Mbps of data symmetrically over two copper twisted-pair lines. The 
range of HDSL is limited to 12,000 feet; signal repeaters extend the service 
farther from the CO.
Head end The cable company's main signal reception and distribution facility. 
The head end is the cable TV equivalent of a phone company CO, and all TV 
cables for a given area route back to a single head end.
IDSL (ISDN digital subscriber line) A form of DSL providing a symmetrical 
speed of 144 Kbps over the copper wire provisioned for ISDN. Repeaters enable 
service up to 35,000 feet from the CO.
ILEC (incumbent local exchange carrier) A LEC dominating the local market.
IP address A numerical identifier for a device on a TCP/IP network. The IP 
address format is a string of four numbers, each from 0 to 255, separated by 
periods.
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) An all-digital replacement for 
analog telephone service. ISDN provides two 64-Kbps channels, called 
B-channels, over a single phone line, which can be used together or 
independently to carry voice or data. The data signaling channel, or 
D-channel, carries signaling and limited packet communications at either 16 
or 64 Kbps, depending on the service.
LEC (local exchange carrier A local telephone company.
POTS (plain old telephone service) Standard telephony for placing and 
receiving calls.
PPPOE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) A protocol that allows DSL 
providers to meter connection time and to acquire a smaller, cheaper block of 
IP addresses. PPPOE changes DSL from an always-on to an on-demand service and 
lets providers reduce the size and cost of their Internet connection 
infrastructures.
RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies) The seven companies that were 
created after AT&T's divestiture in the mid-eighties. Also known as Baby 
Bells.
SDSL (symmetric digital subscriber line) A form of DSL that transfers data 
upstream and downstream at symmetric rates of up to 2.3 Mbps over a single 
copper twisted-pair line.
T1 A digital carrier technology used for transmitting data through the 
telephone system at 1.544 Mbps.
T3 A digital carrier facility used for transmitting data through the 
telephone system at 45 Mbps.
VDSL (very high data rate digital subscriber line) An evolving form of DSL 
that can deliver data at a rate of 13 to 52 Mbps downstream and 1.5 to 2.3 
Mbps upstream over a single copper twisted-pair line. The operating range of 
VDSL is up to 4,500 feet from the CO.
VOIP (Voice over IP) Software and hardware that allow voice signals to be 
carried over an IP-based network with POTs quality and reliability. VoIP 
segments the signal into frames, which are stored as voice packets.
VPN (virtual private network) An authentication, encryption, and 
data-packaging technology that lets private network traffic travel over the

Steve,

It was pleasure meeting you this morning. 

Following is the MSA that we discussed this morning. I think all we will be 
required to do is amend the agreement to read "telecommunications services 
and bandwidth units". 

Further, on Monday, I hope to send you a draft of an "outsourcing" agreement 
between Enron Corp., and an affiliated entity.

Best regards,

Donald

Jeff, we are working on getting a guarantee.  The finance folks favor a 
guarantee from EBS.  Is that OK or do we need Enron Corp.?  Also, I am not 
sure how quickly this can be done.  Is there a problem if we don't file until 
next week some time?   Thanks.

Subject: Corporate Guarantee for ETI filing in California

Greetings Steve and Robin:

One requirement for ETI's filing in California (which we'll hopefully submit 
Friday or Monday) is a bank letter confirming $100K in liquid assets.  An 
alternative available to us, which we all decided is preferable, is a 
corporate guarantee.  Has that been cobbled together yet?  Is there anything 
you need me to do to help pull it together?  If so, just holler and I'll be 
glad to help.  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

thanks for the call today.  I agree with your perspective on CLEC status / 
implications for EBS.

What we need to think about doing (as we discussed on the phone) is to come 
up with a regulatory risk assessment of becoming a CLEC in CA --

id key risks
assess value at risk (quantitative and qualitative)
develop mitigation plans (incld working to end the need to be a CLEC), and 
assign people to manage the plans.

Happy to help as much as possible.  We should try and have this and then 
discuss with broader EBS WG.

Thanks.

JDS

Here is the NDA.  You need to select the Read Only option in order to open 
and print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an 
original executed NDA.  After the other party executes it, you will need to 
get an EBS attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on 
our behalf.  Please make sure I get an executed original back.  Thanks

Greetings all,

 Scott Bolton and I wanted to give you the "low-down" on the strategy meeting 
taking place next week in New Orleans.  

The meeting will be held at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside.  The hotel 
address is:  Poydras at the Mississippi River, New Orleans, 70140.

We have reserved a block of sleeping rooms (16 total) at a rate of $189.00 
per night.  The room reservations are for the nights of January 19 and 20, 
checking out January 21.  Each meeting attendee will need  to call the hotel 
directly to make reservations.  The number to call to make reservations is 
504.584.3999.  Tell the reservationist that you need one of the rooms in the 
"Enron Communications" block.  If you want a confirmation faxed or mailed, it 
must be requested at the time of booking.  Those flying into New Orleans on 
January 20 need to tell the reservationist that they will need the hotel room 
on January 20 as opposed to January 19 and 20.  Room reservations must be 
made no later than January 12. Each person will be responsible for his/her 
hotel room and charges.

The meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:30 AM on January 20 and end around 
2:00 PM on January 21.  The meeting will be held in the Cambridge Room.

We will be sending out a formal agenda by Thursday this week.  During the 
meeting , we will be developing  our team's objectives and strategy for 2000, 
hearing from a number of ECI commercial people, and conducting lots of Q&A.  
Please contact myself or Scott to confirm your attendance as soon as 
possible.  
 
Best Regards, 

Scott & Donald

Subject: Regulatory Info and discussions on digital divide  

Thanks for the note. I will call Royce. By the way there is a new book out 
called "Tele-Revolution" by Richard G. Tomlinson. It has the MFS story in it.

I will be getting  copy of my book for you in the next month or so.

Also attached is a new powerpoint I worked on over the weekend to use to 
discuss the Regulatory issues associated with the EBS business.

Look it over and lets talk. 

Here is the memo I sent out internally.


A regulatory conference call precipitated a bunch of discussion last week and 
I have been talking to Griebling and Jim F.about the need for an overall 
strategy from a regulatory perspective.  Below is my view of the issues and 
my attempt to scope the discussions that need to occur. We need to hire  
regulatory group that has dealt with these issues in Wash, DC, the PUC level 
the city Gov. level and Internationally. Jim F. has been given the name of a 
company that knows the issues and could help us decide how to proceed. I 
consider this to be a key strategic issue for the company.

Also, we must now be concerned about the rising movement in Wash. DC to 
charge a tax on all revenues associated with the Internet as well as creating 
a Universal services fund as a result of the Digital Divide Debate. This has 
huge financial implications if we set it up wrong and they create a tax or 
Universal Services fund for bridging the Digital Divide. This may be one of 
the hottest topics in DC. and the mood is very much for the Democrats to push 
for such a tax on all dollars spent via the Internet. This would be a huge 
drain on EBS and other companies.  Enron on line could also be hurt as well 
as all trading deals on the net. 

The other issue is the local loop for Wasabi and the implications of 
extending the pooling points to multiple carrier hotels in a city. Also later 
to the CO.  Griebling has suggested we could file for  a unique status, get 
some press, and bundle numerous ideas inot an entity that could sidestep the 
regulatory national and local loop issues in one fell swoop. Would be nice. 

We need to decide if the entity that goes to carrier hotels is the same 
entity that goes to the CO. If the entity that goes to the CO is a CAP or a 
CLEC or just does a commercial deal with the CAP that does business in the 
City. Should we do a deal with the CLEC to go to the CO or is the entity a 
CAP or CLEC?  Do we just do business with the numerous existing CLEC's? This 
has huge implications to the franchise fee we would pay to  be a CAP or CLEC 
which would be on all revenues so we would need to limit those taxes. If we 
choose to be a CLEC we would fall under the Universal Services fund and there 
could be other negative and  costly requirements. What entity and how we 
commercially get to the CO is a key decision to make. 

We also need to make sure the entity that sells bandwidth via the Pooling 
points is never taxed via the Universal services fund as it exists  today or 
could exist in the future. The other issue is the status of the company that 
owns the fiber and the DWDM equipment is it the same company as the poolling 
points and the IP layer the way it is today? What about the applications 
layer and what about the different commericial groups that need streams at 
the applications layer and the groups that need a Tiered QoS IP cloud? Can we 
claim we are not the internet and would hold a special status? Can the BOS 
and the EIN allow to claim a special status and would the pooling point 
extension to multiple carrier hotels allow us to have a special status? 

Luckily the Technology for All TFA efforts is something we can point to to 
show how proactive industry is being in bridging the Digital Divide and there 
is no need for the  new internet based universal service fund some are 
talking about. That is one of the reasons that Ken Lay is on the board of TFA 
nationally. We need to get the  TFA lab installed in the DC area to show off. 
Anyway, we need to now include that open issue  of a potential tax on all 
internet transactions in our discussions of how we structure the company and 
make sure we would minimize the taxes assocated with selling things on the 
Net.

Jeff -- here is a rough outline of the activities we will be doing in CA.  

ECI porposes to:

* provide managed virtual private line service using DWDM technology over our 
own proprietary network.  This is primarily an interstate service, but some 
segments may be marketed and sold between points in CA.

* acquire OC-48 capacity on other networks and "mux" them down into DS-3, 
OC-3 and OC-12 increments and then re-sold to other carriers and large 
enterprise users.  Some of this activity will be interstate and some 
intrastate but interLATA.  

* possibly buy,lease, or build local loop capacity to connect metro 
points-of-presence, probably in LA and San Jose.  These facilities would 
carry mostly interstate/international traffic, but add/drop within the city 
and LATA.

QUESTIONS:

- Do we need a CPUC Certificate for these activities?
- Is there more benefit to common carriage vs. private?
- Will ECI need to tariff services?

Thanks for your help and interest.

Brian/Jeff

I reviewed the articles on Global Photon for more detail, and found 
references to the following contracts:

6/7/00 $100 million contract with Alactel to build a fully integrated 
submarine and terrestrial Dense Wavelenthg Division Multiplexing network in 
California (a 2000 km network called the Global West Network)

4/19/99 Tyco International Ltd.'s Tyco Submarine Systems Ltd. unit signed a 
$93 million supply contract for Global West, a five segment fiber optic 
undersea cable system that will connect major cities along the California 
coast.  TYC said an operations, administration and maintenance contract will 
bring another $50 million, and two optional segments could increase the value 
by an add'l $25 million

The permits obtained to begin the project are referenced in a press release 
on the company website.  There is no other supporting evidence of these 
contracts or any other, nor further mention of Global Photon's Global West 
Network project.

Ethan,

Thanks for the research.  My cursory review of the articles turned up one 
interesting fact: they claim that GP has signed a $100 mm contract with 
Alcatel - a euro telecom company.  Please:
Re-review the articles to see if that is correct and any other contracts you 
can find.
Try to double check the press releases by looking at alcatel's published 
financials if any.

This is a pretty low priority thing.  Try to have it done by Friday afternoon.

Thanks,

Brian

First, let me thank all of you who have been drafted into the Enron 
Communications Army.  Communications is rapidly becoming a core business and 
function of Enron and as ECI expands both domestically and internationally, 
it will require a significant amount of the State Government Affairs group's 
support.  You all had high draft numbers because you have either expressed an 
interest in working on telecom and e-commerce, and/or are in a strategic 
position to assist ECI's efforts.  My understanding from Rick is that you 
will be out on point in your respective regions or in Aleck's case Country, 
in identifying issues of interest for ECI, provide advocacy and 
problem-solving for ECI's regional projects (i.e., fiber builds in the South 
-- Mr. Robinson), manage regulatory/legislative efforts, and help increase 
ECI's visibility with your local policymakers. That said, hopefully your 
interest will stay high and positive and this won't seem like the real Army 
-- the one with the drill sergeants and all. 

Now that we have an informal "Team" in place (and will likely add a few more 
folks) to actively monitor and participate in telecom, please feel free to 
call/e-mail/visit with myself, one another, or any ECI person to discuss any 
issue or answer any question.  I know that many of us feel pretty overwhelmed 
by these issues and I don't want anyone to be intimidated.  We have fantastic 
people here at ECI who can quickly bring you up to speed or provide feedback 
on a variety of concerns.  ECI is doing some revolutionary things and we will 
become well-known very soon.  You will get to be a part of that. 
 
Please let me know what issues seem hot in your areas, what types of things 
you feel you should know more about, and how much focus you believe you will 
able to give telecom in addition to the workload you already have.  There is 
always something going on in this industry and we will need to balance 
interests carefully.  Sue Nord and I will be getting out issue books to the 
whole State GA group here in the coming weeks.  This should be a useful tool 
to help you prioritize your workload.  I will be sending on to you more clips 
about ECI, our products, and internal info to give you a better feel for what 
we are trying to accomplish.  We may also start some conference calls (good 
god not another one!) and expect to caucus when we meet at group functions.   
Also, everyone should own a Newton's Telecom Dictionary, e-mail me if you 
don't have one.  

I am very excited to be working alongside all of you and hope we can keep an 
interactive dialogue of our progress and deeds.  

Best,
Scott

Williams Invites Telecom Carriers To Talk Bandwidth
Friday, April 7, 2000 04:36 PM

	By Michael Rieke 
	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Following up on its February pledge to be a leader in 
developing a liquid market for telecommunications bandwidth, Williams 
Communications Group (WCG, news, msgs) will host a meeting of telecom 
carriers next week. 
	Ken Epps, senior vice president for strategic marketing for Williams 
Communications, told Dow Jones Newswires that the first objective for the 
meeting will be understanding any concerns carriers might have about a market 
for standardized trading of bandwidth. 
	That's a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company 
wasn't impressed last May when Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) suggested 
trading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions. 
	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks. 
	Many observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams 
Communications. After all, 85% of its stock is owned by Williams Co. (WMB, 
news, msgs), which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and 
natural gas for years. 
	But Williams Communications didn't get behind the idea until February when it 
told industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group. The new group 
includes Sharon Crow, who had been a gas trader and risk manager with 
Williams Energy Services, a unit of Williams Co. She is now vice president of 
bandwidth trading for Williams Communications. 
	Since then, a number of other companies have said they want to play in that 
market - Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs); El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG, news, msgs
); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia Energy Group (CG, 
news, msgs); and Koch Industries. 
	Those companies all have one thing in common and it isn't ownership of 
telecommunications bandwidth. They all have years of experience trading 
energy commodities. 
	Last month companies from the energy side joined some carriers and others 
interested in standardized trading of bandwidth at a meeting put together by 
CompTel, a telecom industry trade association. 
	At that meeting they decided who would be considered principals in the 
bandwidth trading market - companies that will "take title to," or own, 
bandwidth. In other words, principals will be either telecom carriers or 
companies that will buy and sell bandwidth to manage risk in the 
telecommunications industry. 
	They also formed a committee of principals to study standard terms and 
conditions needed to establish a liquid market for bandwidth trading. 
	People who attended the meeting said two of the largest carriers were missing 
at the CompTel meeting. MCI WorldCom (WCOM, news, msgs) was there but AT&T (T
, news, msgs) and Sprint (FON, news, msgs) weren't. 
	The meeting next week, which starts Monday, is for telecom carriers only, 
Epps said. This week, he wouldn't mention names of the companies invited, but 
last month he told Dow Jones Newswires his company's meeting would include 
"the real players, the MCI WorldComms, the Qwests (Q, news, msgs), the 
AT&Ts.... It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to 
advantage the marketplace, how we build a good powerful market model," Epps 
said.

SB 1741; Telecommunications:  technology specific area codes, Author: Bowen 
Introduced 2/23/00
Sponsor: Author Sponsor
Summary:
Currently, in California,  area codes cannot be approved based on specific 
technology.
This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to request authority 
from the Federal Communications Commission to require telephone corporations 
to establish technology specific area codes based on wireless and data 
communications.  This bill would also prohibit the Public Utilities 
Commission from approving new area code splits or overlays unless a 
technology specific area code had been established in the affected area and 
further area code relief is warranted.

Position: 
What is our position on this issue? Should we watch this bill?
Attached is the bill.

AB 1784:  Internet Tax Freedom Act: Continuation  Introduced: 1/26/00
The California Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits, with specified exceptions, 
the imposition, assessment, or attempt to collect (1) a tax on Internet 
access, On-line Computer Services, or the use of the Internet or On-line 
Computer Services, (2) a bit or bandwidth tax, or (3) any discriminatory tax 
on On-line Computer Services or Internet access.  This act provides that it 
is to become inoperative on January 1, 2002.
This bill would remove this limit on the operation of the California Internet 
Tax Freedom Act.

Status: read first time. 



SB 1217: Internet broadband access.   Introduced: 2/26/99
Under the Public Utilities Act, the Public Utilities Commission has the 
authority to regulate public utilities, including telecommunications.
Existing law does not address nondiscriminatory access to the Internet 
through wireline broadband Internet access transport providers.
This bill would enact the Internet Access Enhancement Act of 1999. 
The bill would require a wireline broadband Internet access transport 
provider, as defined, to provide any other requesting Internet service 
provider, as defined, access to the broadband
Internet access transport services of that transport provider, as prescribed.

COMM. LOCATION:  ASM UTILITIES AND COMMERCE
LAST ACTION DATE:  07/12/1999
Status: Although no recent activity has occurred, this bill is a 2-year bill 
that is alive because it passed out of its house of origine last year.

MUMBAI 15 NOVEMBER


ENRON Communications (ECI), an affiliate of the $31bn energy major Enron 
Corp, is preparing for a major push in the Indian communications sector. 
Enron will start off by forming a joint venture with the public sector Ircon 
(Indian Railway Construction Company) to enter the telecommunication 
business. Enron will provide very high capacity broad-band networks as well 
as services, followed by bandwidth trading in India, said Enron South Asia 
CEO and managing director Sanjay Bhatnagar.


Enrons joint venture with Ircon is expected to help the former use the Indian 
Railways reach for laying the fibre-optic networks. Mr Bhatnagar did not 
confirm the JV proposal nor reveal precise details but The Economic Times has 
learnt that the Ircon board has already cleared the proposal. ECI, through a 
separate subsidiary, is likely to spearhead Enrons telecom businesses in 
India.


Speaking about ECIs plans, Mr Bhatnagar said, This will be a new business for 
us in India, though we have been doing it in the US for over two years.


Enron already has 32,000 kilometres of fibre-optic broadband network in the 
US connecting 18 cities. The next-generation broadband network will 
incorporate both terrestrial components like fibre-optic cable and space 
components like satellites. While the network and the services will be rolled 
out nationally within six to eight months, Enron, the worlds largest gas and 
electricity trader, will get into bandwidth trading activity in India only 
about two years from now, Mr Bhatnagar said.


Broad-bandwidth networks will be the infrastructure of the future, he said, 
adding, Enron will use its expertise in energy trading for bandwidth trading.


The networks and services will allow applications like video-conferencing and 
video-delivery. We will target multiple customers, including ISPs and 
corporates with requirement for high bandwidth, Mr Bhatnagar added.


Bandwidth trading will allow under-utilised networks to be used to full 
capacity, as excess capacity will be sold when not needed by particular 
customers. These initiatives will also allow hosting of burgeoning Indian 
content within India, thus facilitating the domestic Internet market, as 
Internet usage becomes easier and more cost-effective, he said.


Globally, there is great synergy between pipelines and fibre optic networks 
and it makes perfect sense for Enron to tap the communications potential, 
said an energy analyst. The pipelines are used as conduits for fibre optics 
which can carry voice, data or video information, he added. Even in India, 
some utilities like the MSEB (Maharashtra State Electricity Board) and the 
Indian Railways are already using this routing. Electricity and gas 
distribution companies have a natural monopoly in the form of their pipeline 
and cabling which has the benefit of a wide reach that can be used by others.


Ircon has been known for innovation in its business and has expanded its 
international operations in the past few years. The company recently got a Rs 
525-crore order from Malaysian Railways, where the company which could not 
pay in cash paid Ircon in kind. Malaysian Railway paid MMTC in the form of 
palm oil and MMTC paid IRCON cash in India. Ircon also paid its highest ever 
dividend of 225 per cent this year to the government. The company made a 
profit of Rs 56.2 crore .

Scott et al---the annual Council of State Governments meeting was held last 
week in Quebec City and one of the panel presentations during the week was on 
"Global E Commerce:State Roles.

The panel was moderated by the Conference of World Regions (Jmaes Gardner and 
Lucy Duncan).  Participants were: 
 
 Rep. Matthew Kisber--Tennesee  (he is also co chair of the NCSL task force 
on e commerce)
 
 Arthur Kerrigan---section chief of e commerce for the European Commission in 
Brussels

 David Cliche--Minister for Information Highway/Government of Quebec

 DAvid Hite--CEO of Veronex Technologies

 Todd Finch---President, Netscape/Canada

 Bernard McKay---Vice President, INTUIT


The government folks focused most of their discussions on the need to 
continue to be able to collect taxes on sales, but said they were not looking 
to increase those taxes--just to be able to make it easy to collect.  Kisber 
seemed  to be in the Governor Leavitt camp on e commerce solutions--he 
referenced Leavitt's proposals several times.  Cliche made some interesting 
statements about Quebec having all of it's government work being done via e 
mail by the end of 2001---anybody who wants to do business with the 
government will have to do it via e commerce.

THe private sector folks talked about the difficulty in dealing with 50 
different state rules and regulations in order to do their business and the 
need for uniformity and commonality.  Finch talked about the need for global 
governance of the internet rather than local or parochial which will only 
inhibit development of e commerce.  He also talked about if and when states 
or entities will start thinking about trying to tax information that is 
exchanged via e commerce and how this would be counterproductive.  McKay 
brought up the concept of government becoming a competitor with the private 
sector as e commerce changes the way we do business.

It was a fairly interesting discussion, but no real bombshells.

Scott--Kisber mentioned that there was going to be a meeting of the 
COngressional interent taxation committee next week in San Francisco (this is 
the Governor Gilmore group).  Are you attending that meeting?

Hi Jeff
I apologize for the late reply! I have been swamped with a few things these
past two weeks and your note got lost in the shuffle. But, I finally figured
out how to retrieve messages that I flag for follow up. I will probably not
be the right person for you to connect with here at Quokka but let's meet
and I can learn more about what you are doing and we'll go from there.
Please feel free to give a call at your convenience to set something up - I
am fairly open next week if that works for you.

Take care and I apologize again for the late reply.

Greetings Mark:

We met previously, but most recently at the West Point Inn.  (As a tangible
point of reference, Prentice Sellers and I go out.)   Anywho, I mentioned
our
broadband/video streaming services and think you folks would find that be
our
service offerings can add a lot of value to what Quokka's delivering to the
market.  Would very much like to get together with you and/or others who
might
be responsible for that side of the business.  Let me know if you think it
would
be useful to meet and when a good time might be.  In the meantime, you can
check
out our broadband business at enron.com.

Best,
Jeff

Brian,
It is my understanding that the ISO has the right to get flat rate, (no 
mileage charge) access into the ISO network from within the LATA of the A 
POPs.  If this access is at the right price it means that any customer 
wanting to get a circuit between say, Redding CA and Orange County, CA would 
have VERY cheap access and competitive Long Haul.  That being said, at this 
point I do not think the A POP information is crucial to our initial meeting.

We need to ascertain the following:
1) Can the ISO nail up discreet circuits on this network?  It is currently a 
meshed ATM backbone with traffic being routed dynamically.  
2) What conditions need to be met by the ISO to scale the network to OC48?  
If they cannot scale it we have only about an OC3 of available bandwidth and 
that is not worth our time.
3) What are the DS3 and OC3/12 access rated from MCI?  This will uncover our 
true opportunity in this deal.

Jeff,

Following are the categories of "telephony" services that should cover "all 
the bases" in CA. 

Intrastate private lines
local loop 
data transport services
lambdas aka  AFTS 
IP transit
*simple voice re-sale

* If we can get it - because it won't be to long before this included in an 
intermediation deal

Sue and Scott, can you think of anything else?

Jeff, I am attaching electronic copies of two documents you requested
yesterday -- a list of the documents required for a CPCN filing and the
verification needed for the application (as I mentioned, the
verification does not have to be notarized).  I have also faxed an
example of a bank letter of credit (we redacted the client name) and a
copy of the order instituting a rulemaking on CEQA that we discussed.
Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita.

Paul,

Thanks for your note.

A few comments that correspond to yours:

The DS-3 pricing is not material since it is only used for sending encoded 
content to the EIN.  It is not directly part of the Internet transit 
proposal.  We are awaiting a price from our provisioning group (who gets it 
from other providers).
I am awaiting a proposal from a colocation provider at the Westin on pricing 
for Activate.net.  It is likely that we will NOT get involved and have the 
customer work directly with this provider.  As such, we should not have the 
headache as well as the worry about pricing this element.
We would actually need fiber riser between our suite at the Westin and the 
Meet-Me room at the Westin; not Gigabit Ethernet.  No pricing at this point 
but I would expect this to be $1K per month maximum
My estimate on the 6509's is $100K each installed for a total of $200K.  For 
a GSR, I would put this at $200K each for a total of $400K.
I am awaiting pricing from our provisioning folks for the dark fiber that 
would allow us to run Gigabit Ethernet over this infrastructure.  They are 
working with Level-3.  I have also asked for OC-12 pricing if we don't get 
the dark fiber.
See response #4.  The only difference is that we would need to pay Level-3 
for a rack to be placed at their end for our equipment.  Estimate for this is 
$1K per month.
Pricing from L-3 for Internet transit is approximately $250 per Mbit per 
month as measured on a 95% percentile.  This might go down as you may have 
heard from Dorn due to market conditions and our bulk buying power as well as 
some price configuration changes by Level-3 (e.g., pay $200/Mbit/month based 
on the higher of upstream or downstream measurements).

A Visio drawing, its equivalent bitmap rendering as well as an Excel 
spreadsheet containing a very preliminary estimate of pricing is also 
attached for your reference.




What has to be added as part of any pricing analysis is the IP & AFTS 
transport that we might provide in the future to carry some of the traffic 
outside of the Seattle-area because Internet transit there might not be 
sufficient or too congested.

Matt and I will do more work on this proposal on Wednesday & Thursday and 
will plan to keep you informed.  Again, we owe a term sheet to the customer 
later this week.

Merat

Subject: Activate.net Costing Issues

Below are the Activate.net pricing elements we need for the economic model 
that will be discussed during tomorrow's TDS (aka. Transaction Development & 
Structuring) meeting at 11AM Pacific Time.

Local Loop Pricing (DS-3 from Activate.net to Westin)
Total cost of co-location at Westin
Gig Ethernet Cross Connect from Westin router to EBS router
Installed cost for 6509 Router and GSR 12012 Router at Westin;  [WE NEED BOTH 
ESTIMATES DEPENDING ON WHICH LOCAL LOOP IS AVAILABLE]
Local loop from Westin to L3 gateway (Gig Ethernet on dark fiber and OC12); 
WE NEED BOTH ESTIMATES DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY]
Installed cost for 6509 Router and GSR 12012 Router at L3;  [WE NEED BOTH 
ESTIMATES DEPENDING ON WHICH LOCAL LOOP IS AVAILABLE]
Pricing of Internet transit from L3 [Allen Hill and I need to talk to Dorn 
this afternoon and will address this pricing issue with him.]

Do you know if we will be able to have G Ethernet on dark fiber for local 
loop from Westin to L3?    I will look for the pricing elements tomorrow 
morning and we can discuss when I call you tomorrow at 8:30AM Pacific Time.  
Let me know if I can be of assistance in tracking down any of the information.

Thanks!

Hi Jim: 

As we discussed, your client, the California Independent System Operator, 
contracted with MCI to build a high-speed, broad band network (predominately 
OC-48?)as the platform to launch electricity deregulation in California.  
Since that time, the ISO has discovered that it has capacity substantially in 
excess of what it needs to operate the grid (and certain markets for power, 
e.g., ancillary services).  

Rather than try to re-negotiate the contract with MCI, the ISO is now looking 
at marketing the capacity.  Sounds like the capacity runs between Sacramento 
(Folsom?) and Southern California (Alhambra?).  Please correct any 
(unintended) inaccuracies I may have included in this very brief description.

Tom Gros is VP of Enron's global bandwidth trading group and can help 
determine the value/feasibility of having the ISO make use of Enron's 
bandwith trading platform.

Tom, meet Jim.  Jim, meet Tom

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:  ISO is still working on the specifications and interconnection points
of their capacity.  The delay is due to some discussions with a current user
which may result in more capacity being available.  I'll keep you posted.

SB 1626: Author Hayden -- Introduced 2/22/00
Author Sponsored
Summary:
This bill would, for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2000, 
and before January 1, 2005, allow a one-time refundable personal income tax 
credit, not to exceed $500, in an amount equal to 80% of the cost paid or 
incurred for obtaining a personal computer, printer, and access to the 
Internet, as provided.
This bill would require the commission to establish a class of lifeline 
Internet access service necessary to meet minimum residential Internet needs, 
set rates for that service, develop eligibility criteria, assess the degree 
of achievement of universal Internet access.
The furnishing of lifeline Internet access service is in the public interest 
and should be supported fairly and equitably by every Internet Service 
Provider, and the commission in administering the lifeline Internet access 
service program, should implement the program in an equitable, 
nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral manner for the Internet Service 
Provider industry.

Position
I assume we want to monitor this bill. Do you need any more immediate 
information? 

Attached is a copy of the bill

The DC office did a terrific job monitoring this ... we will need to look at 
what happens on internet licensing next year.

Description:	HEARINGS ON WEBCASTING ISSUE PLANNED NEXT YEAR 
Detail:	
>From COMMUNICATIONS DAILY, November 22nd, 1999




Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings next year to determine whether 
compulsory license rules need to be changed to accommodate Internet streaming 
media
providers, senior panel Democrat Leahy (Vt.) said Fri. Webcasting issue was 
one of last sticking points in reaching agreement on overall Satellite Home 
Viewer Act
(SHVA) rewrite. Senate was due to approve SHVA, part of general 
appropriations bill, after our deadline Fri., following House approval on 
296-135 vote late Nov. 18.

Senate Majority Leader Lott (R-Miss.) after our deadline Thurs. formally put 
Senate on record as committing to come up with program to help provide TV 
service to
rural areas. In response to objections from Sen. Baucus (D-Mont.) (CD Nov 19 
p3), Lott produced agreement, adopted unanimously, calling for Senate to act 
on rural
loan guarantee for DBS by March 30, even if bill hasn't been reported by one 
of Senate committees. In that case, either Lott or Democratic Leader Daschle 
(S.D.)
would be able to bring straight to Senate floor legislation calling for $1.25 
billion loan guarantee program that was stricken from SHVA bill to meet 
objections of Banking
Committee Chmn. Gramm (R-Tex.). Lott said he's "absolutely determined to get 
this done. I will not only live up to this [agreement], but I will do so with 
a great deal of
vigor and activity." House leaders made similar commitment.

One potentially interesting question that could arise next year is which 
committee will produce rural loan guarantee bill.

Gramm wants first shot at it through his committee, but there's some 
sentiment that Agriculture panel also should be included if Rural Utility 
Service will administer
program. Senate Agriculture Committee spokesman had no comment.

Leahy, also member of Agriculture and Appropriations committees, told news 
conference there apparently are "shifting jurisdictions" among Senate 
committees. He said
TV viewers don't care which committee produces bill: "We tend to be 
pragmatic." However, he said measure eventually will come to Appropriations.

One Hill staffer suggested that several committees could claim piece of rural 
loan guarantee, including Agriculture, Appropriations, Banking, Commerce. In 
that case, he
said, easiest path would be to move bill directly to Senate floor.

NAB Exec. Vp James May, who took part in news conference called by Hatch and 
Leahy to celebrate Judiciary Committee's scorecard for year, said he thinks 
Senate
will take up bill and put it on fast track for passage. In that case, May 
said, chances are good senators will try to attach other issues to it.

On Webcasting issue, Leahy said language added in House "raised unnecessary 
concerns" among Internet companies so it made sense to remove it from SHVA 
bill. He
said committee will "hold hearings on the subject first thing next year to 
see if it's necessary" to change copyright law. Leahy said language excluding 
digital online
services from cable and satellite compulsory licenses wasn't intended to make 
major change in law.

May said Webcasting debate may give NAB chance to take another look at its 
policy on compulsory license. Broadcasters always have favored statutory rate 
while
MPAA, whose members own content, want free market to decide. May said NAB may 
think about adopting MPAA's argument to allow broadcasters to "take
advantage of marketplace opportunities" and receive payment from Internet 
companies for Webcast material. RIAA Pres. Hilary Rosen said it will be 
interesting to see
how broadcasters reconcile those positions.

Senate also passed dozens of bills without debate or discussion. Among those 
were one authorizing use of digital signatures (S-761) from Sen. Abraham 
(R-Mich.) and
another (S-692) banning Internet gambling, sponsored by Sen. Kyl (R-Ariz.).

Senate version of digital signatures bill is very close to one rejected 
overwhelmingly in House, which adopted more wide-ranging bill sponsored by 
House Commerce
Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.). - - Art Brodsky

By , Inter@ctive Week
November 19, 1999 7:12 AM PT




This week's Webcast tied to ABC's "The Drew Carey Show" drew 1.9 million 
viewers,
making it one of the largest Webcast events in Web history. 

But anointing the Nov. 17 Webcast as the single largest multimedia event 
online depends
mostly on how you do the counting. 

The Web video -- produced by "Drew Carey" creator Bruce Helford and Warner 
Bros.
Television and intended to be watched simultaneously with the on-air 
broadcast of
Wednesday's "Drew Carey Show" episode -- was able to stagger its viewership 
over three
separate airings of the television show in the Eastern, Mountain and Western 
time zones of
the United States. 

Consequently, it's difficult to make comparisons with previous Webcast 
events. Online
broadcasts, such as February's online lingerie fashion show by Victoria's 
Secret and
Broadcast.com that drew an estimated 1.4 million visitors, typically have 
been one-shot live
events drawing all of their traffic during a single showing of the Webcast. 

Figures detailing peak online viewership levels are not yet available. Warner 
Bros. cobbled
together a network of online multimedia distribution companies to handle the

Webcast's traffic, making it difficult to compile detailed viewership data 
quickly, said Jim
Banister, executive vice president of Warner Bros. Online. 

Warner Bros. contracted with a string of companies -- including Akamai 
Technologies,
Enron, e-Media, Globex, iBeam Broadcasting, InterVU and Sandpiper Networks -- 
to carry
the Webcast feed. Because of the scattered nature of the distribution system, 
it is hard to
tell how many users were blocked from accessing the video feed or to 
determine how long
viewers stayed tuned in to the Webcast, Banister said. 

Still, Warner Bros. officials are heartened by the early results and are 
planning additional
online streaming events, including an online promotion for rock band 
Metallica slated for
later this month. 

"We are going to see exponential growth in the ability to do Web streaming 
events,"
Banister said. "It's only going to get better and better and more refined."

The first streaming Webisode of ABC laffer "The Drew Carey Show" from Warner 
Bros. Online attracted nearly 2 million visits, capturing more viewers online 
Wednesday night than most cable programming.


Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday it has inked a pact with actor Chris 
O'Donnell to begin producing original content for its upcoming entertainment 
hub Entertaindom, sometime in the next year.


While watching "Carey's" regularly scheduled TV show on ABC, Netizens also 
used Microsoft's Windows Media Player to watch what happens inside Carey's 
house when he's at work, including Ed McMahon failing to find Carey to hand 
him a $1 million check, and dogs and ghosts throwing a bash inside the house.


Warner Bros. is using the Webcast to tease its new online streaming video 
venture Entertaindom, which officially bows Nov. 29. Its event slate includes 
a weeklong Netcast of the new Metallica album.


The "Drew Cam" sweeps event was exec-produced by Bruce Helford and produced 
by Warner Bros. Online in association with Warner Bros. Television and 
ABC.com.


Tech partners for the event included Akamai Technologies, Don Mischer 
Technologies, E-Media, Enron Communications, Globix, Ibeam, InterVu, 
SandPiper-Digital Island and Sonic Foundry Media Services.


"This is a television-Internet first," Warner Bros. Online exec VP Jim 
Banister said. "Not only was the program entertaining and evolutionary in its 
cross-media creative expression, it also gave birth to a new paradigm in how 
to reach large audiences via streaming media."


Ratings for "Drew Cam" may have topped the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and 
MTV's NetAid events, which so far rank as the most watched video broadcasts 
online.


Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday that O'Donnell has handed over 
management of his Web fan sites to Warner Bros. home page community AcmeCity, 
the latest example of an actor attempting to protect his image on the 'Net.


O'Donnell has 57,000 fansites on Yahoo! GeoCities, alone.


Warner Bros. will also help steer the official Web presence of O'Donnell's 
George Street Pictures, which produced "The Bachelor" and the upcoming CBS 
telepic "Miracle on the 17th Green."


O'Donnell said he will produce yet-to-be-determined programming for 
Entertaindom in the coming year.


"I want to begin building a core audience of Internet-based fans today 
because producing entertainment programming (online) will mean a lot more 
than making movies in the future," O'Donnell said.

Greetings All:
When we spoke with Bowen, et al last week, we determined that there were some 
deliverables that Enron needed to pull together before we could get the 
application in order for filing.  According to my notes, those include:

Articles of Incorporation--Steve
Cert. of Status as Foreign Corporation from CA Sec. State--Steve 
Pro Forma Balance Sheet--Scott/Steve/Todd Henney (sp?)
Customer Base Estimates--Scott
Bank Letter Confirming 100K in liquid assets--Scott/Steve
Modifications to the price list, etc., in the draft AFTS 
tariff--Scott/Steve/Rebecca Lynch
Biographies of Key Management--Scott

We also talked about trying to have another call either on Tuesday or 
Wednesday.  

Two questions:  
What's the status of pulling together our internal deliverables?
Does it make more sense to get the deliverables pulled together first, before 
we have another call?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, 
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, 
etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes 
of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and Scott:

Thanks very much for giving me the opportunity to meet with you both
today.  As I said during the meeting, I think your business plan is in a
very good space, especially given the recent FCC order and the
insatiable demand for IP bandwidth, in California and elsewhere.  We'd
love to work with you on legal/regulatory/business issues.  I think we
could add significant value, for the reasons we touched on today.

Scott, I left a VM for the President of Cmetric, asking him if he's
interested in the opportunity presented by Enron.  As soon as he
replies, I'll forward his contact information to you.

Please get in touch with me at any of the numbers on my business card if
you have further questions or need more information.  I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

Regards,

SPB

Williams Communications Forms Bandwidth Trading Grp
Friday, February 11, 2000 12:50 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	
	By Michael Rieke 
	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, news, msgs) has 
formed a bandwidth trading group in a step toward embracing standardized 
bandwidth trading. 
	The company was initially opposed to the idea of bandwidth trading as a 
commodity under standard terms and conditions, so its change of opinion is 
being viewed by analysts as a key step toward creating a commodity market for 
telecommunications bandwidth. 
	Williams Communications now wants to be a leader in setting industry 
standards for bandwidth trading, Gordon Martin, president of Williams 
Communications' carrier services, told Dow Jones Newswires. 
	The company plans to draw on the commodity trading experience of Williams Co. 
(WMB, news, msgs), Martin said. Williams Co., an energy company that owns 85% 
of Williams Communications, has been trading energy commodities such as 
natural gas for years. 
	Williams Communications has named Sharon Crow as vice president of bandwidth 
risk and optimization management. She was previously a gas trader and risk 
manager with Williams Energy Services, a unit of Williams Co. 
	Williams Communications has one of the largest interstate telecommunications 
networks in the United States. It has recently been adding more 
telecommunications fiber on both the local and international level, Martin 
said. 
	
	"This is a market that may not be at a maturity level that others would like 
to think it is in terms of ability to trade," Martin said. 
	That's a clear reference to Enron Corp., which proposed last year that 
bandwidth be traded as a commodity under standard terms and conditions. Enron 
did the first such trade in December, agreeing to buy DS-3 bandwidth from New 
York and Los Angeles in monthly increments from Global Crossing Ltd. (GBLX, 
news, msgs). A DS-3 fiber moves data at a rate of 45 megabits per second. 
	Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron, said he 
welcomes Williams to the bandwidth trading market. "This is something that 
enables all of us to more effectively manage our bandwidth and offer more 
innovative solutions to our clients." 
	Williams Communications' Martin is quick to point out that his company has 
been trading bandwidth for about 15 years. 
	Those deals have typically been long term, as long as 15 to 20 years. 
Traditional bandwidth deals take weeks or even months to close as companies 
negotiate quantity, price, quality of service, creditworthiness, damages for 
non-performance and other issues. Each new deal would start again from 
scratch to negotiate those issues. 
	By setting standard terms and conditions to cover such issues, industry 
players can trade bandwidth more quickly and more efficiently, Crow said. 
	The resulting liquidity will add flexibility to the telecommunications 
industry, allowing producers and users of bandwidth to manage risk. Crow said 
Williams Communications wants to take the lead in forming a 
telecommunications industry committee to standardize terms for bandwidth 
trading. 
	
	That's an about-face for Williams Communications. Last May a company official 
was quoted as saying that bandwidth couldn't trade as a commodity under 
standard terms and conditions. 
	Last December another company official spoke at a bandwidth trading 
conference in New York City. He was still skeptical but softened the 
company's opposition to the idea. 
	Crow said Williams Communications and Williams Co. have had a committee 
studying the bandwidth trading idea for more than a year. 
	The group was looking at the issue from a timing perspective to see how long 
it would take to become liquid. Now Williams Communications wants to help 
spur that liquidity. 
	Part of Williams Communications change of opinion has had to do with the 
evolution of Enron's trading proposal. It was originally seen by Williams as 
a proposal to trade minutes of long distance telephony minutes, said a 
Williams official who didn't want to be identified. Later it evolved into 
trading of high-speed data transmission bandwidth. 
	It's also become evident this year that the stock market likes the bandwidth 
trading idea. Before Enron did its first bandwidth trade in early December, 
its share price was less than $38 a share. Then mutual funds came in to buy 
large blocks of stock in December, pushing the share price above the $50 
mark. 
	The share price got another shot in the arm when Enron played up bandwidth 
trading and its fiber-optic network at its analysts meeting Jan. 20. On Jan. 
19, Enron's stock closed at $53.50 a share. On the day of the analysts 
meeting, it closed at $67.38. The next day it closed at $71.63. 
	The market's reaction to Enron's bandwidth position "did invigorate our 
examination of the issue," said the Williams Communication official. 
	"The market had shown a willingness to reward the kind of capability we 
believe we had but that we hadn't brought this kind of focus to," he said. 
	All the Williams Communications officials stressed that a liquid market in 
bandwidth would enable the company to manage risk for itself and for its 
customers. 
	Under the traditional long-term deals, a bandwidth consumer has to buy enough 
bandwidth to handle its maximum needs. It continues to pay for all the 
bandwidth even if it's using only part of it at times. A liquid market would 
allow a consumer to more closely match its bandwidth purchases with its 
needs. 
	Williams hopes to be pushing liquidity in certain aspects of trading, like 
monthly deals instead of only multi-year deals, said a company official. 
	The more bandwidth trades, the more buyers and sellers learn about the value 
of individual telecommunications products, he said. 
	Crow said the company is still working on an "action plan" to put together 
its trading group. It could draft employees from the Williams Communications 
long-term trading and deal organization group, the Williams Co. energy 
commodity trading group and from outside the company. 
	As for organizing an industry group to set standards for bandwidth trading, 
she said that could be as simple as calling other telecommunication carriers.

Power Points: Trader McAndrew Tackles Nymex, Enron
Friday, February 18, 2000 12:14 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By Mark Golden 
	A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--When I first started covering the electricity industry 
almost three years ago, people told me to talk to Thomas McAndrew, one of the 
original power marketers, considered by many to be one of the best. 
	A nuclear engineer by training, McAndrew left a job at a Southern Co. nuclear 
power plant to get a masters degree in business from Harvard in 1994. He 
first traded at Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), and then moved to the Eastern 
Group, the U.S. unit of Statoil, Norway's state energy company. Statoil 
exited the U.S. power and gas industry late last year. 
	McAndrew and his trading team have been doing some consulting and trading on 
their own account since Feb. 1. They are looking to stay together and work 
for another firm. 
	Meanwhile, without a corporate spokesman over his shoulder, McAndrew was able 
to speak his mind about the troubled New York Mercantile Exchange electricity 
contract and power shortages expected this summer. He also talked about the 
success of Enron at trading both profitably and online, and the difficulty of 
doing both at the same time. 
	DJ: Why have the New York Mercantile Exchange's electricity contracts not 
worked? 
	T.M.: The Nymex clearly lost on electronic execution of trades because now 
you have Bloomberg, Altra and EnronOnline. With the Nymex, I had to call, get 
a quote, the guy didn't even stand in the ring, and maybe I would get two 
lots. I could execute 100 times as much over-the-counter with half the 
effort. 
	They still think they have a monopoly on clearing trades. They don't realize 
that there are at least four companies looking into it, and my guess is that 
within six months one of them will have a solution. Now the Nymex has 
nothing. 
	DJ: They will begin trading electricity contracts strictly electronically, 
not in the ring at all, starting March 2. Do you think that will revive the 
contract? 
	T.M. Not really. The industry pretty clearly told the Nymex last fall that 
what we want is electronic execution with clearing of (seasonal) strips, not 
just single months. But the Nymex has had the attitude consistently that they 
know more than the industry. They've treated the industry in a condescending 
way. All you can trade is the months, while there's a tremendous amount of 
volume being traded OTC on location spreads and strips. 
	I expect the best volumes ever in the next four months. All it takes is the 
top 10 guys to take 50% of their business to the Nymex and they would see 
tremendous growth. But the only way is to have strips available April 1, at 
the latest. If history is the judge, they won't do it. They should be 
embarrassed. 
	There's a lot of interest within the Nymex not to launch strips because of 
what they would have to do with crude oil and natural gas. They're an 
exchange run by the locals. 
	How can the Nymex succeed when EnronOnline supports 10-cent two-way spreads 
in the front part of the curve? It's hard to justify going to a market with 
40 cents between the bid and ask just to get clearing. 
	If the Nymex doesn't have a strip product in place by April 1, they're done. 
	DJ: What do you think of Enron's online success? 
	T.M.: If they continue to support it the way they are, it's good for the 
market. If they support it for six months and then spin it off, then that's 
not good. 
	DJ: Are they that good at trading to continue to support 10-cent spreads? 
	T.M.: No. Are they that much better than the market? They're obviously very 
good traders, but not that good. I don't know many traders that can do that. 
	Obviously it's a great story for them. The goal of EnronOnline in the short 
term is to generate revenue, not profits. 
	DJ: Enron has maintained very good trading margins for years. You used to 
work there. How do they do it? 
	T.M.: They hire really smart people, and they have a solid infrastructure and 
great risk management. I've been an Enron shareholder for years and will 
continue to be. I just bought some more. They are the blue chip of the new 
energy business, risk management and now broadband. 
	Do they do everything right? No, but when they do something wrong they 
contain it and correct it. They know when to ride their winners and when to 
cut their losses. 
	DJ: Are the California Power Exchange and other pools inflating wholesale 
electricity prices in their states? 
	T.M.: There's a fundamental reason for prices going up: tremendous increase 
in load growth without a corresponding increase in generation. Realistically, 
we should be trading in the West at the levels of PJM (the Pennsylvania-New 
Jersey-Maryland pool), but because of regulatory uncertainty we're not. 
What's the price cap going to be this summer? $500? $750? Nobody knows. 
	I think the California Independent System Operator is getting ready to find 
out about the law of unintended consequences. The price cap in place is a 
disincentive to building generators, which will lead to a shortage of power 
and higher prices. 
	In the rest of the country, metal is going into the ground and they're 
squeezing every megawatt out of existing plants. 
	There are a limited number of turbines. If you went to General Electric right 
now, you'd have to wait four years for a gas turbine. Where are the people 
that have them going to install them? In California with price caps? Probably 
not. Look at the price of a five-year summer strip at Cinergy. You're going 
to put the turbines in the Midwest. Even if you have to pay 50 cents more for 
gas, who cares? 
	You don't make prices go down by putting in price caps. You make prices go 
down by adding supply faster than demand growth.

Jeff:

Per your request, please find the 2 Memo's we prepared on
interconnection agreements - the first deals with general rights and
responsibilities, including options for obtaining ICAs.  The second Memo
focuses entirely on the specifics of how ETI obtains ICAs, and the
advantages and disadvantages fo each option.

Once you have had a chance to review the Memo's, we can discuss the next
steps in more detail.  Please feel free to let us know any questions in
the meantime. Thanks.

hope this helps you understand what's going on better. Call/see me if you have
any thoughts or questions. I also have a cd rom that is helpful in seeing the
network in action.

AB 2198 Telecommunications: local telephone service competition. Author: 
Pescetti Introduced 2/24/00
Sponsor: Author
Summary:
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to require the commission 
to remove barriers to local telephone service competition in all 
unincorporated areas of south Sacramento County, to the extent not preempted 
by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Position:
This bill requires a specific area of California to remove barriers to 
competition. Are there telecom Munis? is this preemptive to possible 
legislation on Electric Munis? Should we watch the Bill?

Attached is a copy of the bill

Sue:


To follow up from yesterdays' call with us, we are going to revise the 
California ETI tariff(s) to parallel your national Enron template.? We are 
also looking at Pacific Bell's Tariff CAL. PUC No. 175T to determine their 
current Dedicated Transport service tariffed rates, and will advise. 

We have a PDF version of the Master Sales Agreement, and are incorporating 
some minor revisions - and maintaining the Contract as governing over the 
tariff.? I believe we also needed input from Enron Broadband Sales on the 
California customer Forms for filing with the updated tariffs. 

If you could pass along the template so we can change the services, that 
would be greatly appreciated.? Please let us know any questions,

Hi Jeff,

Just a follow up to our call this morning.  If you get your guy on the phone, 
try and get the following information:

1) Route map, including both end points of the network
2) Amount of capacity they may want to lay off, (they are currently using 
some of the system, how much do they want to offer?)
3) Any contract details, (how long, terms, penalties, restrictive clauses 
like "cannot resell")

Once we get some details on the table lets get a call together with them and 
see if there is a deal here.  I will be out of the office from the 3rd 
through the 9th attending a trade show, so if we cannot get this together by 
tomorrow, lets do it next Thursday afternoon.

Thanks

SUNDANCE ONLINE FILM FESTIVAL
Enron Broadband Services will be sponsoring the first ever Sundance Online 
Film Festival (SOFF), an exciting new addition to the popular Sundance Film 
Festival in Park City Utah, January 18-28, 2001. The online festival will 
feature dynamic works such as animation, documentary and interactive pieces 
specifically designed for the Web. The Sundance Institute, a nonprofit 
organization, is recognized for promoting innovative, independent film 
projects and is promoting the Web as the next exciting new venue for 
presenting these creative ideas.  To read more about Enron's participation in 
the Sundance Online Film Festival, click here.




UPDATES ON PRC & BONUS
The Enron Year-End Performance Review Committees (PRC) concluded on January 
9.  Employees should expect review meetings with supervisors in the coming 
weeks.  If necessary, employees can take the initiative to schedule the 
review with their manager.  Verbal notification of bonuses and compensation 
increases should begin on January 26, and bonus checks will be distributed on 
February 5.



EBS EMPLOYEE JOINS BUSH ADMINISTRATION
Quincy Hicks, manager in EBS Public Relations, has recently left the 45th 
floor of the Enron Building for the East Wing of the White House.  Quincy has 
been named the future First Lady's director of scheduling.  Prior to joining 
EBS, Quincy had worked as chief of staff for First Lady Barbara Bush 
following her White House years.  First Lady Elect Laura Bush is reportedly 
filling her White House staff with veterans from her mother-in-law's 
administration.

HOLIDAY HELPERS 
EBS once again displayed its giving spirit.  During the month of December, 
Kevin Hannon led a group of EBS volunteers to SEARCH, an organization that 
responds to the needs of the homeless by providing them with job training, 
housing, education, and medical support.  EBS volunteers wrapped and 
presented holiday gifts to SEARCH clients.  The gifts, donated by EBS, 
included jackets and other cold weather clothing.  

To celebrate the season in Portland, the EBS office housed the Giving Tree.  
The tree was decorated with tags bearing children's holiday wishes.  EBS 
employees were able to select a tag and fulfill a child's wish.  The tree was 
picked clean, and more than 125 gifts were sent to children at the Morrison 
Center, a family services organization that focuses on breaking the cycle of 
abuse.  

EBS employees make a difference in their communities everyday in different 
ways, including volunteering and donations to their favorite charities.  
Enron has made it even easier for our employees to make a difference through 
the Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Programs (VIP).  Click here to

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES





Surgient Networks Secures $57 Million in Second-Round Funding
Cisco Systems and Enron Broadband Services top the list of investors 

Surgient Networks, an innovative company with a new architecture for content 
delivery network applications, has received $57 million in second-round 
funding as it moves ahead with its product development and planned deployment 
in mid-2001.




Trade Route
As bandwidth prices plummet, some telecom players are betting on electronic 
trading platforms to bring efficiency to the market.

For Kevin Hannon, chief operating officer of Enron Broadband Services, 
falling bandwidth prices are welcome news.  With bandwidth becoming a 
perishable commodity and prices in a free fall, the only hope for telecom 
carriers is a trading platform where bandwidth can be bought and sold for 
future delivery.  That way, they can hedge against price fluctuations and 
quickly unload surplus bandwidth.  Enron is building such a platform.





The Longest Last Mile

...Processing power of PCs and set-top boxes in homes is increasing.  And 
companies like Enron Broadband Services, Akamai Technologies, and Inktomi are 
installing servers and routers all over the country to minimize the length of 
fiber a movie must travel to get to the living room -- the so-called last 
mile...




HOLIDAY TIME
  Enron offices will be closed January 15th in observation of Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day.

Jeff:
Nice meeting you last Thursday. We will send the (lengthy) Application
for CPCN and tariff(s) this week for your review. I know Anita faxed
some additional material, but will also supplement that per our
discussions.
    I did lobbying in Sacramento and know the legislature's compulsion
for telecom. "consumer" issues - you mentioned SB 1217 (Richard Alarcon)
which did pass through Deb Bowen's committee and the Senate, but which
is going nowhere in the Assembly (Wright's committee).  This bill re
open access is contrary to Federal law and to the FCC's hands-off
stance, and appears dead.  There is still the ongoing debate in Portland
(and SF) which will turn on an upcoming 9th Cir. court decision (due any
day now).  The 9th Cir. could breathe life into this issue by allowing
Portland's open access mandate via the transfer of the franchise
agreement. Also note today's WSJ article re AOL's new found quandry.
The tide is against open access for the moment.
    Please call or email if you have nay questions whatsoever.
