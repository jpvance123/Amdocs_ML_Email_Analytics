Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.

Thank you!  I have tested the updated system and every thing seems to be 
working.  I did speak to the Help Desk last week and it was decided that we 
will run this program through Netscape Navigator vs Explorer.

Michelle,
Thanks for your patience.  It works now.
We don't know exact why it suddenly stops calculating marginal fuel.  Each 
piece of program worked correctly.  
We had to rule out possible causes step by step and to make sure the whole 
process work step by step.
Possible reason might be multiple version of calculation component being 
registered in the server and
the correct one was not used lately.  We cleaned it and re-registered the 
working version and it worked. 

Did you have chance to talk to help desk regarding internet explorer upgrade 
to 5.0 ?

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension.  
Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at 
current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have 
tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can 
exercise her ROFR.

KN (Oneok) called to get more information about the Right of First Refusal in 
their current contract.  The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract 
extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW 
know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise.

Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and 
they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out

Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

Completed an IT agreement with CIMA Energy, who owns 5000/day production on 
the Crawford lateral.  Gas will be transported to both the Willi Wick Farm 
Tap in the Texas panhandle area as well as to the West Texas pool.  The 
agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning Sept 2000.  
This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue (currently shipped 
under a Duke FT for 0.02).

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Call me if you have any questions, PT 3-0667.

Subject: Problems with the Deal Profitability Model?

Hello Marketing,
I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There 
were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved 
since no one is saying anything.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues 
you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on 
improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those 
I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Ken

I'll contact internet team with this problem.  In the meantime, if you could 
get out of explorer and come back in to try
it again, I think the message will go away and the point drop down box will 
work.   Let me know.  Sorry for the

Hi Teresa,
Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out 
where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for 
my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage 
instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon!

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,
Lindy

Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being 
auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday.  
Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will 
definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.

Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve 
Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural 
take or pay case.

Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in 
the auctioned capacity.

FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.  On contract #22538, 
there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.  For

Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The 
reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent 
transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal 
for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million 
gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California 
border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 
months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully 
this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.

Michelle, I am trying to get some quantification of actual benefits (in terms 
of $'s saved or loss avoided) of your use of the model.  Could you give me 
some feedback before Tuesday, as Phil Lowry is asking about use and actual 
benefits of this model.

Thanks

Kim

Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard 
with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, 
etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but 
are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They 
also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are 
all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

Subject: Re: Pogo Interconnect

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to 
Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The 
middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I 
have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or 
materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that 
they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of 
January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate 
and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject: Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner 
notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also 
the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so 
should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances 
Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we 
will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  
Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, 
flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The 
chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility 
without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just 
want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it

down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the 
facilities asap.

Subject: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!!  
Yes, let's allget together soon...call me! 

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was 
a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting 
much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all 
three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every 
night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one?

Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.

In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched 
outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there 
appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition 
to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from 
Accounts Receivable.

On Monday, December 4th, a new version of the Marketing Dashboard will be 
rolled out. In order for this new version of The Dashboard to work you will 
need to have Internet Explorer 5.01(IE5.01) loaded on your system. If you 
already have IE5.01, PLEASE RESPOND, to this message  with a confirmation 
that you have IE5.01 or higher loaded. (No other action on your part is 
necessary)

If you DO NOT have IE5.01 please follow the instructions below to install it 
. then respond to this email that IE5 has been loaded. 

If you are uncomfortable doing the upgrade alone or are unsure what version 
of IE you have please call the helpdesk 87-7454 and someone will assist you.

Again please respond to this message ASAP - we are looking to have everyone 
in Houston upgraded by Dec 1st. The total process takes less that 15 
minutes.  If you have any question, comments or concerns please contact the 
helpdesk at 87-7454,

Michelle is it possible to evaluate a park-n-ride in deal profitability?  If 
not would this be valuable?  If it would be Mei-Ling and I would like to meet

Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25.  
They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher 
energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.

Hi Mike,

Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just 
got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave 
temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!

How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you 
love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be 
speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and 
financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much 
shorter!

Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?!

Michelle,

Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It
sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able
to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The
speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i.e., may
have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing
scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation).

I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation
was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him
down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true).

What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa
mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job
function entailed.

Periodically keep in touch because inquiring minds like to know (and I might
use you for some research).

Regards,
Mike Triem

Great Expectations
Forbes - 10/16/2000
BY Lynn Cook
Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq 
Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet 
connections to its iPAQ Pocket.

Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.

Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left 
you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan 
and I are going to be on vacation in California.

Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs!

Subject: Hi!!


Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn

Below is a summary of available future capacity to the California border:

effective 11/01/2001-10/31/2003, 13,500 Needles and 14,000 Topock
effective 11/01/2002-10/31/2003, 21,500 Needles
effective 04/01/2002-10/31/2002, 14,000 Topock
effective 04/01/2003-10/31/2003, 14,000 Topock 

The spreads are still pretty wide even through 2002 at 0.75; and here's an 
opportunity to capture it before it tightens.

Market Services are the schedulers (Cynthia, Amy, Burt, Linda Ward, Terry,

Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?!

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=

ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

Enron is a great place to work.

Subject: Year 2000 Accomplishments

Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum tariff rate for 
California deliveries.  Took advantage of widening market basis spreads; will 
generate $2.7 million in revenue.  Because the original terms had ROFR 
language dictating up to max rate only, included was a revenue sharing 
mechanism if contract is ever released above max rate.  The mechanism 
provides an opportunity to generate market based transport. 
Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various 
pipeline pressures.  Dispute was originally at $3 million dollars, negotiated 
potential damages down to $100,000 in credits on prior transport invoices.  
Deal also included re-execution of Interconnect and Operating Agreement for 
lower volume commitments based on seasonality, thereby eliminating future 
potential dollar exposure.
Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 30,000/day of 
supply on east end of system.  Potential opportunity for future transport or 
park and ride agreement.
Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices.  
Located over $600,000 on Northern.  
Executed agreement with Cima Energy to be a new customer on Transwestern.
Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system.  
System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis 
quote feed to ensure more real time data.
Co-ordinated Open Seasons with internal and external contacts.  Worked with 
programmers to enhance IOS system to handle maximum rate bidding and other 
e-commerce efforts.
Provide backup to both Short Term deal origination and contract processing.
Working with Eprime and SPS on potential power plant interconnect of up to 
200,000/day on east end of system.
Working with Eprime to become a new shipper on system from San Juan to East 
of Thoreau.
Monitor daily basis differentials to maximize additional transport rate 
opportunities.
Working with Market Services and Contract Administration to identify 
underutilized transport agreements for additional marketing opportunities.
