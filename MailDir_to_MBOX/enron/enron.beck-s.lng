I am seeking information on where to find copies of LNG Contracts that were 
previously in the domain of the old Enron International company.   Enron 
North America will be establishing a risk book to manage LNG positions on a 
worldwide basis and we need copies of all contracts to set this up.  These 
contracts may or may not be related to the Dabhol project.  If you can 
provide guidance or information as to where to find these contracts, I would 
appreciate it.  You may respond via email or call me at 713-853-6079 in 
Houston.

Thank you for your attention.

We have delivered a copy of 2 LNG contracts to Scott Earnest's office 
tonight. One is between Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company Limited & Dabhol 
Power Company and the other is between Dabhol Power Company and Oman LNG 
L.L.C.   I understand the EGEP Legal group (Steve Watson) is currently 
working on a third contract but it is not executed at this time. He has 
advised that he will forward a copy when it is completed.

Bridgette -

By copy of this message, I have asked Sandeep Katwala (acting general counsel 
for Enron India) to help locate these contracts for you.  Let me know if you 
need anything else.  Thanks.

Gentlemen,

I was told that both of you worked on the Dabhol project, so I am hoping that 
you can assist me.  As the message below states, I am trying to find 
contracts that are related to this project.  Please see below for details.  
If it was a mistake to send this message to you, please forward to the 
correct individual.

Thank you,

Sally and Scott Earnest called this afternoon.  We will be setting up a new 
risk book to manage LNG positions on a worldwide basis.  Supposedly, there 
are several contracts from the old E.I. entity related to India for LNG.  
They may reference Dabhol Power project, fuel management, fuel oil, heating 
oil....

Scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts.  Can you ask around 
with some of the contacts you made on your India trip to see if you can find 
these and get copies ?

Hi Mary,

Sorry about not getting in touch with you earlier. (Just checked my e-mail) 
Unfortunately I will be out of Houston this weekend and will be headed back 
to India. Hence i will not be able to meet with you. I am looking into the 
commercial aspect of the LNG contracts and hence would like to discuss your 
plans. Can we still do this over the phone??

Sorry again, about not getting in touch with you.

Regards,

Anshuman

Mary,

One of our team members, Anshuman Srivastav, is currently in Houston.  It 
would probably be useful for the 2 of you to meet, so that we can understand 
exactly what your plans are with regards to LNG and what exactly you will 
require as far as contracts go.

Failing that,  the person, who is the official keeper of all our contracts, 
is Sandeep Katwala.  He should be able to get you whatever you need.

Let me know if you have any difficulties and I can try and hunt stuff down.

Heidi

The only conversation I have had with Jeff regarding this topic was when I 
was in Houston and he had inquired as to when I was returning, stating that 
he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas 
Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My 
thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is 
going to roll up to Jeff.  Do you want me to set up a conference call with 
you, Scott Earnest and myself to discuss?  Subsequent to that we should 
probably have a conference call with Jeff to get specifics.  Let me know what 
I need to do on this.

Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?

We are continuing to work with the Enron LNG team to set up risk books and 
capture the trading postions and P/L of their business.  At the present time 
we are focusing on the Elba Island transaction, however, the LNG team has 
requested information concerning an accrual book to accurately capture the 
risks associated with their LNG Vessel "Mystic Lady" as well as an additional 
vessel they are looking to acquire.

Eric Groves has built a curve generating model that will facilitate the risk 
books and/or any exotic option models that may be necessary.   As of Friday, 
we have not received the information needed to capture all of the FOB and 
Delivered Curves.  We have been in contact with Enron LNG and they will be 
forwarding this information.  We are expecting to sit down with the LNG 
commercial team late next week to obtain assumptions such as product sourcing 
locations and the timing of anticipated spot cargoes for delivery to Elba 
Island.

Once we receive the additional information for the curves and the sourcing 
assumptions, we will be in a position to sit down with the research group and 
determine the most appropriate means of valuing these transactions.  We are 
also working with the Europe Engineering group as a source of validating some 
of the information that we have received.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Regards,
Scott
