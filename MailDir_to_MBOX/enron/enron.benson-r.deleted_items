We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

Enron's Chairman Received Warning About Accounting

January 15, 2002

By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with ALEX BERENSON


An Enron executive told the company's chairman in August
that improper accounting threatened to bring down the
company, Congressional investigators said.

All,

Here is the schedule for TDS databases on Netco: (as confirmed by Diana Allen)

TDSP	:	Will be a copy from esttdsp as of Thursday, January 17 2002 at 4:00pm (the day before Netco goes live on Friday)
TDST	:	Will be a copy from tds8itst. As requested, whenever the Netco production migration is completed, this will be refreshed from tape as of prior Dec 19 2001. 
TDSD	:	Will be a copy from tds8idev. I have moved this database into a netco server.  As soon as Clement pushed the tnsnames.ora change, you will be able to connect to TDSD


Please let me know if you have question or modification.

Tantra.

I understand that John forwarded you resumes to review for the next cycle of TT  interviews.  I understand that the deadline is today, can you therefore let me know if you have returned these to John or if we need to collect them from you.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843
Waller		979-826-7643
Brazoria	979-864-1320
Fort Bend	281-341-8670
Liberty		936-336-4629

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Can you please let everyone know that our Power Decision Support database will be down today, and could possible stay down until tomorrow morning.

Hello Everyone,

The Oracle DBA team would like request NetCo production database downtime starting tomorrow Thursday 01/31/2002 at
10am to perform database reorg.  This reorg is important to ensure efficient data access after the data cleansing effort.

Attached is the summary of the reorg work and the estimated downtime.  All NetCo production databases will be ready
no later than Friday 02/01/2002 at 7am if not earlier.

 
Please response with your approval by COB today.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me or your dbas.

Thanks,
Mable

On October 15, 2001, the Midwest ISO filed an amendment to 
Section 17.5 of its Open Access Transmission Tariff to charge 
a fee for non-confirmed transmission service requests for 
transmission service greater than one week. Midwest ISO 
has requested an effective date December 15, 2001.
Interventions and protests are due November 5.

Let me know if you need further information.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Davis Besse would like to delay their  inspection till Spring outage but it appears that the NRC has a lot of issues and are concerned about there analysis of the situation.  It is more than 80% likely that the NRC will request them to do an inspection in late November or early December.  This information will be confirmed during the beginning of November

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Hello everyone,

	We already have a winner in this week's football pool. Rudy Acevedo only missed 5 games and picked Minnesota in tonight's game, while the other people who missed 6 games, all picked Minnesota as well tonight. There were 21 people who played this week, making the prize $63. 

	Among the games widely missed were: in college, mainly just the Alabama/Auburn game; in the pros, Atlanta/Green Bay; NY Jets/Miami; Cleveland/Baltimore; Washington/Denver and Chicago/Tampa Bay. 

	With the short week this week, there will not be a pool this coming weekend. We will resume next week. Here are the amount of games missed by each person who played this week.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

14:01 19Nov2001 RSF-INSIDE FERC: Midwest-Market 2: Lack of sellers forces high Enron bids - PGN311

Washington (Platts)--19Nov2001/301 pm EST/2001 GMT 

One trader said that she found arbitrage opportunities on some of the online platforms, capitalizing on a 5- to 6-ct differential between prices posted on EnronOnline and those on IntercontinentalExchange. She confirmed that few market players are willing to sell to Enron, which is forcing Enron to bid at a premium. 


Spot prices on ANR Pipeline in Oklahoma ranged from about $1.75/MMBtu early in the morning to about $2.36/MMBtu late, up from Friday's range of $1.38 to $1.58/MMBtu.

The World Wide RibFest "celebration of the Rib" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"
			          I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."	
		               She replies:	"No." 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing "personal reasons"

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
>From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

I just wanted to give you guys an update on the current Coned ISDA issues.  Will keep you posted on the progress.

I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.

We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.

Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:

(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal

(2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.

(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)

(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's

(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.

(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral

(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB

(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC

Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?

On October 17, 2001, Dynegy Midwest Generation, Inc. and Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (Dynegy)
tendered for filing a Complaint against Commonwealth Edison Company.  In its complaint, Dynegy alleges 
that ComEd has failed to properly enforce the network resource designation provisions of its Open 
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Dynegy further alleges that ComEd's actions jeopardize reliability, 
deprive Dynegy of revenues for capacity sales, and permits the improper prioritization of network transmission 
service for bumping and curtailment. Interventions are due October 26.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Attached is a spreadsheet that lists all the new generation projects that need artcicle X permitting for New York.  The newest generation coming online is Coneds 360 MW East River Repowering slated for Q4 2002.  However, after speaking to Coned this morning this plan seems a little ambitous and won't probably come online until 2003.  Construction on this project has not yet begun and will be GE Frame7s.  The only substantial MWs under construction is PG&E's Athens plant which is 1080 MWs in Zone F slated for Q3 2003.  Everything else posted is still in planning stages.  However, these numbers do not show any generation under 80 MW that don't require an article X permitting process.  The estimated amount of potential new supply for NYC is 380MW and 204MW for Long Island that could come online that don't require permitting.  

Overall supply recap,  no new sizeable generation slated probably until end of 2003 or early 2004.  Last summer on Aug9 the NYISO peaked at 31,050 MW and Coned peaked at 12,134 MW.  The NYISO predicts that given an extreme weather case the max demand  can goto 32,290 MW.  I will keep everybody updated on any new supply changes.  You can access this website  http://www.dps.state.ny.us/articlex.htm  whichs shows the new generation projects in NY.

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT 


Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a "material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," it warned.

Attacks highlight Enron's value


Energy trader helps customers manage volatility

By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com	 Newswatch <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/default.asp>
More Headlines <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/headlines/headlines.asp?source=>	
	
 	
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, one of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market maintained by Enron.

The attacks highlighted the Houston company's strength as a manager of risk during periods of heightened uncertainty. Through its trading centers, the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility in oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, as well as other commodities. 

Although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks, its trading activity resumed the next day.

By coming back online so fast, "we made the decision to provide some stability in the market," said Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman. "The customers really appreciated the fact that we were there, providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market."

In a financial sense, Enron ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) didn't suffer, Meyer said. But employees at the Enron Building in downtown Houston were badly shaken. Nick Humber, who worked for Enron's wind energy business, died aboard a Los Angeles bound flight that crashed into the World Trade Center. 

"We have offices in Washington and New York, and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way," Meyer said "We also had traders who were on the phone with people in the World Trade Center when the planes hit."

The decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the wake of the attacks "may have increased volatility, a boon to the group," said Bob Christensen, analyst at FAC/Equities. Companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business, he said.

Managing risk is what Enron does best, market players say. And that strength should help the company going forward as U.S. businesses try to recover from the impact of September 11. Through its EnronOnline platform, the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $3 billion a day, Meyer said.

"The world at large has become more risk averse, and Enron, which is in the business of risk mitigation, should benefit from that," said Glen Hilton, senior analyst and portfolio manager for the Montgomery New Power Fund, which has a stake in Enron. "With energy risk and prices potentially going up, they'll be the first number on many CFOs' speed dial."

Other companies do what Enron does, but it's the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading, measured in terms of volume. Duke Energy ( DUK <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=DUK>) is the next-largest competitor, but it has one-third of Enron's volume.

High profile departure

That's a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year, though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000. Other problems notwithstanding, including its money-losing broadband business and its failure to sell the Oregon utility Portland General Electric, Enron's largest black eye came in mid-August when Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive since February, resigned abruptly.

 <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/intchart.asp?symb=ENE>

John Hammerschmidt, senior portfolio manager of the Turner New Energy and Power Technology Fund, said he "freaked out" when Skilling left and managers immediately divested the Turner large-cap portfolios of Enron holdings. Despite its status as a growth player, Turner had re-entered the stock in June after a long absence because of valuation. At the time, Enron was trading in the mid to high $40s. 

"This is a premier company and a premier industry," he said, adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock. One of the rumors was that Enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing, Hammerschmidt said. That has not materialized.

Whatever the problems were, Hammerschmidt said, he felt them to be manageable. When Skilling walked out, Hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true.

"In our experience, when somebody in power leaves for no reason, there's uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous," he said.

Management continuity

Now he's looking to get back in. Enron, he said, works in both down and up markets.

"Enron's earnings are more solid today than they've ever been...and they're valuable because we're becoming a digital economy," he said. "We need high-quality power, and local power plants have trouble providing reliability. Enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system."

Of course there's still the issue about trusting management. After Skilling left, Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman.

"You cannot expect (Whalley and Frevert) to articulate the Enron vision the way Jeffrey did," Christensen said. "They may grow into it."

On the upside, Skilling predecessor Ken Lay, who Wall Street credits with building Enron into a powerhouse, is back at the helm, and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place.

"We have a great deal of confidence in Mr. Ken Lay as he was the original architect of ENE's (and for that matter the entire industry's) tremendous transformation for the past decade," Merrill Lynch stated in a research report the day after Skilling left Enron. 

What's more: "Ken Lay has promised more transparency at Enron, more insight into how the company makes money, which will help," Hilton said. "Trying to forecast Enron's earnings is difficult."

Christensen said that a "lack of data and clarity in regard" to Enron's wholesale operations has been an issue in the past. Enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its third-quarter results on October 16.

Ultimately, only time will assuage investors' concerns. But with the prospects that Enron has, the stock is a deal right now, Hammerschmidt said.

"I don't know what gets people back, but buy Enron at $25, and in a year, you're making money," he said. "I can see the stock getting back to $50 in a blink."

Christi
 
In preparing our business implementation plan, I am trying to identify and prioritize the relevant transmission agreements for each of the 3 northeast pools.  My assumption is that, for pure internal transactions in each of the three pools, we do not really need to be a signatory to the respective ISO transmission agreements, and thus signing of these transmission agreements is not of the highest priority.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
My sense is that we only would need to sign on to the ISO transmission tariff to facilitate inter-pool transfers and/or to serve load in the regions.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
Please email or call me with any insights you might have.
 
Regards
John

Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :		Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Starting tomorrow, 11/28/01 we will be included with the Gas Breakfast and Lunches.  However, there will be a cost of $5.00 each or $10.00 total when breakfast is provided.  They will have lunch everyday and breakfast only three days of the month, which will be during bid week.  

I will come around every morning and collect your money...I will then have to provide a list to the Gas people who will be checking your name off as you enter the breakfast/lunch line.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

REMEMBER...ONLY THOSE WHO GIVE THE $5.00 WILL BE EATING.

Thanks for your cooperation,

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Rika,

 Davis-Besse will probably be using Framatome to perform the repair work on the head crack.  You will probably see wire reports that Framatome expects to be complete with the repair in about 60 days.  We, however, totally disagree with that assessment.  Framatome may be estimating based on total amount of work they have to do, but they are not incorporating any delays for regulatory review and approval.  I believe our July restart forecast is much more realistic.
 
 
Thanks,
Dan

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I have updated the list to reflect all changes received. If you notice any more errors or if any counterparties have been reassigned, please let me know so that I can continue to make changes.
Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers.
Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right.
Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms. 

Please call me at 5-3614 if you have any questions or come by my desk at 06541.

Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Subject:	NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
2001/2002 Winter Assessment is shown below.  A copy is also available on
the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/~filez/pressreleases.html

If you have any questions, let me know.

Sincerely,

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions."

"Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably," he added, "although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter."  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

FROM Dr Arusi Agbara.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL BANK.
LOME-TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.
FAX:00228-222-45-84

DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr Arusi Agbara, chief accountant for the bills
and credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of

African International Bank Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.Arusi Agbara.

Indian Point 2 is expected to go into a midcycle outage starting this Friday (10/26/01). We anticipate they will be down for about two weeks. We will keep you updated as they are getting a lot of heat from the NRC and have a lot of pressure of the former Con Edison employees to perform, that are now working for Entergy.

We will need to be packed and ready to move for WEDNESDAY, 02/06/02 & THURSDAY, 02/07/02.  The move team will be moving our group during the day and the stenos will NOT be working until Monday, 02/11/02.


Also, please make sure that we LOGOFF again tonight...the IT group could not migrate us over the weekend due to incomplete items with legal.  They are going to try and take care of the migration tonight for the new UBS systems.


Thanks for your help.

There will be a UBSWE Migration TONIGHT....please make sure that you LOG OFF before you leave today.  

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Password.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enron rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your password, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....email will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  All material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO documents or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbox, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as access to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thanks for your immediate help in this matter.

It looks like 713-584 are the new prefix's, but they are as follows:

713-584-1091
713-584-1093
713-584-1050
713-584-1092

I've not been in that room, so I would guess that the first number would be sufficient.

Benny, I don't know if you knew Brad or not... but he used to work at Coral in Calgary. I think he traded Merc. Anyways, he has contacted me a couple of times to play hockey and really wants some players..
I told him I would forward this note.  I am going to try to get out one of these days.

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :	Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

In light of the current situation at our company, our desk VAR, per Lavo, has been lowered.  As a result I must do my part and change the VAR limits across the desk.  As before, I will allocate VAR according to profitability.

Benson- 4.5MM
Broderick- 700K
Gupta-900K
Rogers-300K
Quenet-300K
Davis-4MM

Again, there will be action taken for repeated and/or extended violation.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. 

Enron Messaging Administration
