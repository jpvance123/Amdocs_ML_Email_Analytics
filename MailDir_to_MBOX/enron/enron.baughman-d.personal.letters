Hey man;

This is Brian (David's brother, Sean's brother-in-law);

Just thought I'd yell at you to see what was going on.  I've been here with 
EBS
for 3 months now and have been meaning to shoot you an email or something....

Anyway; give me a shout when you get a chance....

re: sailing trip.

we are watching the weather forecast closely.  hoping we can avoid rain.
if it looks to be too shitty, the trip may have to be canceled. may be a
last minute decision.  be forewarned.

Something we really need is a gas-fueled camping lantern.  Reid claims
to not have one & neither does Tom Booth (by the way, Booth is going
too).  Do you have one?  That would be something you could bring.  We
need it to see at night in the cabin & whatnot so we can play trivia or
cards or whatever.

I'll have this thing drafted for Rudy soon.

Subject: Gift Declaration Document


Marc,

Thanks for creating this document for me!  Rudy says he will take us out
to
supper at a nice joint, next week sometime.  If your paralegal needs any
additional information, drop me a note and I will get it.  The following
is
the necessary data:

Gift Declaration

"I Yolanda Herrera,"the Benefactor", give my son  Rudy Acevedo,"the
Beneficiary", the Property on 1216 and 1218 Tulane St. (** possibly
extraneous ** The reason for me giving my son the property is that I
will
be that I can no longer afford to pay the mortgage.)  The Property,
approximately 6,000 sq. ft., currently has a duplex which is identified
as
1216 and 1218 Tulane St., in the Heights Subdivision, North of Downtown
Houston, Texas. This is a pure gift and no money will exchange hands.
The
effective date is January 25, 2001.  The Beneficiary assumes all
ownership
responsibility and liability of said Property."

(Identified spaces for  benefactor, beneficiary, two witnesses and a
Notary
Public)

Thanks again,

SnAKeBiTE

PS  We need to get our ducks-in-a-row regarding whom is acquiring which
supplies for the sailing trip!

Hola Hermano,

How are you? I have been busy ever since trying to get everything in order
to leave. I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until
I leave, not that I blame them. It even doesn't make me mad because I
haven't had time to think about it. Anyway the work has also been more
interesting in the last two months than the two before I left for holidays.

I now find myself in peculiar situation similar to maybe going off to
school. I am leaving somewhere where I have made a lot of close friends and
had heaps of great, and trying experiences and am preparing for the next
step in life, oh no a CAREER, ouch that hurts. I however am excited on where
this new road may lead me and as you know man I am ready to come home. I
sure wish you could have been here for the going a way party, it was so
fantastic, other than not getting laid. I am so tired of these foreign know
it all, fascist, snobby, anorexic, egotistical, meniacal, deceptive, nose
ring wearing, no dancing, big shoe sporting, tasteless,  putas! I really
can't wait to meet some nice Texas girls or someone with similar interest.

I miss you a lot too and can't wait to have some nice parties and dinners as
well, I am more of a budding Chef. My guitar playing is getting a little
better. So what's the scoop. Anything happening in work, relationship,
houseshopping, fishing hunting. So what's up there. Mom says you're working
like crazy and occasionally looking for a house. How's that going. I can
tell you, it never fails. No matter where I go I seem to run into decisions
all with the same gravity, I guess if there is third guarantee in life it is
decisions. If you haven't finished by the time I return I would like to help
you

I can't wait! I have had a great time here but I really am ready to return
home. I know now I never wish to permanenetly live outside of Texas. Anyway
I'm so busy packin and taking care of paperwork and contracts and bla bla
bla it takes all my time! My last day of work is Next Wednesday (28th) and
then I will travel and visit some friends for about three weeks. This
weekend, since I'm not at home for Mardi Gras I will go to visit a Thomas in
Cologne Germany and go to one of the greatest Karnival Celebrations in the
world. The following weekend my flatmate David and I are off to Rome and
then Budapest (Hungary). Then the last week (on my home) I will leave Zurich
on the 15th of March and stop off in Den Hague and Amsterdam (Holland) for 6
days to visit Natalie. Well I am not leaving for a while and will constantly
have acces to the internet so write back and let me know how things are
going. All the best on at work and on finding a house und so weiter. By the
way I am searching for some jobs there have you heard from anyone or can I
write to anyone?

Love ya bro,
Travis

Thought you might like to see this...... the shit just continues...........




Hmmmmmm, 

Let's see if I can address these issues....

I'm not 45....... 

I do not have Hypercholesterolemia, I don't even know what it is........ nor 
do I have any cholesteral problems...... 

I don't have Hypertension.......... 

My father had diabetes..... I do not and do not have any problems as such....

AND my father died at 62.... not before age 55...... so your little check 
marks seem.... let's see......... without regard to intelligent recourse.  

Therefore, my request is for you clear me for Enron's Fitness Program or 
remove me from such consideration... as I WILL NOT be getting any physician's 
release for me to perform any additonal exercise... AND I won't have him 
signing any release for me to jog at Memorial Park....... OR play my usual 
softball three times a week.... or clear me for Spring skiing at 
Steamboat............. 
 
Thanks for your attention to details.... unfortunately, I think you are way 
off base here......... so either clear my application or quit wasting my 
time.  

Thanks... Richard

As some of you know I have recently relocated to London to join the Shell
crude oil trading team. While I don't yet have a permanent flat address
(hopefully I'll have that taken care of in the next week), I do have some
contact info in the meantime.

Work phone #:  011.44.20.7546.2381
Mobile phone #: 011.44.781.018.2647
Fax #: 011.44.20.7546.4448
e-mail:  Charles.C.Uus@stasco.com

Once I get a flat address and telephone number I'll forward that along as
well.

Hopefully if some of you find yourselves in London in the future we will be
able to get together.

Regards,

Charles

Check this out.   On Thursday I emailed Ed Campbell, the guy that writes
the "Campbell's Guide to Cruising Texas."  I wanted to know what he
thought about me trying to take my sailboat up Bastrop Bayou.
Surprisingly, he replied almost immediately with a long, fairly helpful
email.

Marc:

My explorations of Bastrop Bayou have been done on "skinny water" craft.
However, I have been there during very low winter water, where the deep
channel was very clear. It does wind through shallower areas,
particularly
just north of the ICW. If you take it really slow and read the channel
with
a depth sounder or (more dependably) with a cane pole about 10-12 feet
long,
finding the deep water shouldn't be a problem. However, for parts of the
trip, I suspect carrying a six foot draft could be interesting (not your
problem, fortunately). I hope the FM road bridge is upstream from your
friend's house; it looks like a 45 footer (marginal for your 32, I'll
bet).

Maybe your friend has a boat, or a neighbor with a boat, and you can
arrange
to go for a "look see" ride armed with your cane pole. Just from casual
observation, I've often seen shallow spots crop up near waterfront
housing
from yard runoff, etc. that might cause more problems for you than the
bayou
itself.

I'd guess that the biggest problems for you will be at the ICW
intersection
(it's sometimes difficult to find the deep entrance there: just keep
poking
your nose in, slowly...it's there...) and at the upstream end of your
trip.
Of course, it's always fun to "divine" the navigational meaning attached
to
a particular piece of PVC stuck in the mud here and there.

Short of a prior "look see", you might consider what I often do. The
dinghy
is in the water. towed on a short painter and available for instant use.
If
I see a shoaling trend or lose my "feel" of where deep water lies ahead,
I'll anchor (short scope) where I am (although not in the ICW!) and
explore
in the dink using a sounding pole or lead line. Cindy and I worked our
way
across the flats on the Bahama Bank side of the Berry Islands using that
technique several years ago. Out there, they say you can tell depth by
the
water color - well, yes, but on the banks water that is 4 feet looks the
same shade of white as 2 feet...or 6 inches for that matter...problem is
that you can see where you left bottom paint... Ya' jus' gotta go slo'

Sounds like a fun trip. I'd like to hear more.

Regards,

Ed Campbell

Don,

What time are you getting married on September 22nd? Is the trip to Mexico
still on and if so, what is the date for that and who do I need to contact
for details? Also, do you have Travis's phone number so I can get a resume
from him to show to Duke Human Resources?

Sorry about the question barrage.

Don and Shannon,

Congratulations to both of you on your engagement from the Snapkas.  We also
would like to welcome you to the Bay Area!  I am sure the neighbors do not
know what they are in for.  We are always looking for someone to drink with.
We can even call it dinner.  I hope things are going well with the
arrangements.  If you invite us over, we would love to pee in your pool.
Take care!

Gerald and Cindy

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

Adios,

Jury awards patient $10.5 million for misdiagnosed testicular cancer
By KEVIN MORAN
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle
GALVESTON -- Two Texas City physicians should pay $10.5 million in
damages for failing to diagnose testicular cancer in a patient more than
three years ago, a jury decided Thursday.
The award in a medical malpractice lawsuit against Texas City's
Beeler-Manske Clinic, Dr. John H. Cochrane Jr. and Dr. Salvador Faus
came after a weeklong trial in the Galveston court of state District
Judge Frank Carmona.
The jury found that in May 1997, the physicians failed to diagnose
testicular cancer in Bryan Davidson, 41, said his Houston attorney, Mike
Mallia.
The cancer went undiagnosed for 13 months, after which Davidson, of
Santa Fe, underwent surgeries to remove not only one testicle but also
parts of his lungs, to which cancer had spread, Mallia said Thursday.
Cochrane and Faus had attributed lumps on Davidson's testicle to
side-effects of a vasectomy, Mallia said.
He said that Beeler-Manske physician David Nickeson finally made a
correct diagnosis.
Houston attorneys Richard Law and Robert Scheerer, who represented the
clinic, Cochrane and Faus, could not be reached for comment.
The defendants maintained that Davidson did not develop cancer until
after his May 1997 examination, Mallia said. He added that defense
attorneys did not indicate Thursday whether their clients would appeal
the case.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated about 15 hours over
three days before returning the judgment of $10.5 million in actual
damages.
Davidson, who is on medical leave after 16 years as a Texas City
chemical plant employee, and his wife, Debbie, also a plaintiff in the
case, did not seek punitive damages, Mallia said.
Had Davidson's cancer been detected early on, he might have avoided
extensive chemotherapy and lung surgery, Mallia said.
After one round of five chemotherapy treatments, Mallia said, Davidson
was declared cancer-free. But the disease cropped up again, he said,
forcing Davidson to undergo harsher chemotherapy.
"Early diagnosis would have meant that he would have had just surgery to
remove that testicle," Mallia said. "Some doctors, conservatively, would
have given just two rounds of chemotherapy just in case something has
metastasized microscopically."
As of September, Mallia said, Davidson had been cancer-free for a year.
He was scheduled for a three-month checkup at Houston's M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center after the trial ended Thursday.

Everyone have a merry Christmas It has been a great year.  Our P&L stands at 
$4.2 million.  Our budget was $10 million at the start of the year, then it 
was changed to $5million when they took the 5% away from us.  After the slow 
summer and when doubt settled in on our ability to achieve our goal it was 
knocked down to $3 million.  However, when we proved that we were fighters 
and not quitters and soared right through the $3 million, the crawfish came 
along and knocked it up to $4 million and then up to $5 million.  Regardless 
of all the crawfish boils we have been invited to this year, the bottom line 
is that you never quit and I can say that I am DAMN proud of our group.  We 
have been given 4 different managers for this year.  We started with the 
infamous Jason Haile. He left in February because he had his doubts about us 
achieving our goal.  Then Mr. Mark Dana Davis took the interim until he was 
able to bring in Jeff King.   Jeff was with us from April until July and did 
a great job, he represented us well and knew how to bring out our strengths.  
In August we inherited Mitch Robinson.  We had to pack our bags and move into 
Mr. Robinson's neighborhood.  Mitch taught us the operation side of the 
utilities and we showed him that trading real time is not as easy as it 
looks.  Mitch also fought for us,  I was in several different meetings in 
which I saw him fight for us,  I know we had our differences but at the end 
of the day he really stood up for us.  He came to a conclusion that his 
skills and interest are dealing with assets.  Now going into the New Year we 
have been given a new challenge.  I would like to say that I strongly believe 
that we are and can stay at the top of the industry as the best.  In order to 
stay at the top we have to believe and become the best that we can be.  You 
never stay the same, you either get better or you slide down the hill.  
Everyone of us has an opportunity.  There are always going to be days that we 
feel like what in the HELL am I doing here.  However if you stay positive and 
take care of your responsibilities we will stay on top.  Patience, 
Perseverance, and Organization are our keys to success.  To keep from 
rambling I will close with this great philosophy.  Every one of us has 
talents and desires and they are all different.  We are still a team and 
always will be a team and to be a successful team we have to have  the utmost 
respect for one another and you have to take it upon yourself to not give any 
of your teammates a reason to not respect you. My only expectations are for 
you to give 100% and know your role.  If you do not know your role come see 
me.

Thanks and God Bless
Big Daddy

Pat Hallisey has volunteered to organize the events, circumstances and data
that occurred last week concerning the storm.  He has presented a very
thorough outline of  the document.  He is asking for comments from all of the
residents.  We do realize that many of the residents do not have time right
now to write their  experiences and many people are not receiving the emails.
 It is very important from an historical point of view that we do document
events so that presentations can be made on behalf of the residents at future
meetings and planning sessions.  Thank you. Mary G. Strickland

MESSAGE FROM PAT HALLISEY  --
Ok, Just as a starting point below I will list the beginning of an outline
for the Clear Creek Village view of Tropical Storm Allison.  I hope each of
you will add a section or sub-section to it and supply information.

If I understood Peggy Zahler correctly, I think what she asked for  a
perspective that would chronicle the events, circumstances and data that
occurred from Tuesday June 5-10, 2001 for the purpose of having a historical
perspective of how Tropical Storm Allison and its remnants effected Clear
Creek Village.

Please keep in mind this is only a beginning, all data can be sent to Pat

Things are going well here. Lot's of credit events keeping us busy.

I plan on coming to Houston in summer 2002, hopefully we can do
some fishing or something. I will give you a call once I make plans.

Hope things stay in your favor with the merger.

Best regards,

Jeff L.

Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly
impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look
like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due
to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract,
about a month ago.

How is your gig?

Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

Hi Don,

How are you?  Mark told me that you had mentioned to him that I could send
my resume to you again regarding the analyst position.  Thank you very much
for offering to help again, I really appreciate it! I think the position
sounds very interesting and I would love to have the opportunity to speak
with someone about it.

I have attached my resume in Word 2000. Please feel free to contact me if
you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

Thanks again.

Christine Walton

Hello Everyone,
=20
This is in reference to this years Bocktoberfest in  Shiner another weekend=
 getaway. =20
(Like I need another  one)
=20
October 12,13 & 14th
=20
Below is a list of performers for this years  event.
=20
We are again going to rent an RV to drive to  Shiner again this year and wa=
nted to know who would all like to join  us.  We will be leaving in the RV =
on Friday afternoon/evening and be  driving down to Moulton (or maybe somew=
here else) to eat, drink and be merry  there on Friday evening.  Then we wi=
ll go to my Grandmother's house (she  doesn't live there any longer) to spe=
nd the night.  At the current time we  are planning on renting one RV.  The=
 RV will sleep 8 people and  the house sleeps 8 people.  There has been tal=
k/interest in maybe renting a  second RV.  Also for anyone not able to come=
 down on Friday they can meet  us on Saturday and stay over with us on Satu=
rday night again at my Grandmother's  and in the RV.  There are no close ho=
tels in the area and the few there are  have already been booked.  We have =
made this trip twice in the past and  both times it has been very enjoyable=
.  We are able to park the RV across  the road from the festival and this h=
as made it nice for everyone to just hang  out and enjoy the music from the=
re or go into the festival and still have a home  base to come back to.  An=
yway those of you who have attended in the past  you know the routine and t=
he new people, I say welcome.  Please don't  spread the word to far about t=
he trip because we definitely don't have room for  everyone. There=20
are a few more people invited than just the ones on  the above list.  Signi=
ficant others are invited.
=20
And now you ask the price for all this fun and  excitement?
=20
If wanting to participate in the RV ride-down and  keg beer on board along =
with some snacks the price is a cool $85 maybe  $90 a person for the entire=
 weekend.  That is with 8 people coming  along for the ride.  If just comin=
g down on Saturday and partying, hanging  out and spending the night the pr=
ice is whatever you want to pitch on how  much snacks and beer you feel you=
 consumed or just bring your own.  The RV  trip is the most fun.  I have ex=
perience. I know.  We may get two RV's  if enough interest.  In years past =
I have been able to come up with free  tickets.  This year may not be so ea=
sy.  Concert tickets are around  $20 apiece.  Beers inside are $3.00.  That=
 is why we like having our  own party it is a little cheaper on the other s=
ide of the fence.  We will  also cook Fajita's or something simple in the a=
fternoon.  Any questions let  me know.
=20
We would like to know something by the end of this  week or first of next a=
t the latest.

This is a message I got from Joe yesterday about Saturday night.  It makes 
me no difference if ya'll want to go out for an evening on the town.  Sounds 
good to me.  Some of us are heading over to Roger Creager at Garden in the 
Heights Thursday evening.  I don't know if we really need to meet to discuss 
the weekend or not.  I am handling all of the food for the weekend and the 
only other issue is who is riding with who.  Jay is taking his Expedition. 
We are leaving from my house Friday afternoon.  So, Don, Travis and Gerald 
will be coming from the Clear Lake area and I guess are planning on riding 
together.  The question is do ya'll want to meet us at my house?  I have a 
map I can fax over or you can look up where we are staying on the internet 
and get directions.  The web-site is willowcreekranchtexas.com.  There are 
directions on the web-site.  Jay wants to meet tomorrow at the skeet range 
off of Westheimer if anyone is interested in doing that.  You can call him 
at 281-844-0071  that is his cell. number.  Please read the message below 
also.

Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

Don and Shannon,

Congratulations to both of you on your engagement from the Snapkas.  We also
would like to welcome you to the Bay Area!  I am sure the neighbors do not
know what they are in for.  We are always looking for someone to drink with.
We can even call it dinner.  I hope things are going well with the
arrangements.  If you invite us over, we would love to pee in your pool.
Take care!

Gerald and Cindy

Subject: Unclassified rules


These are  the rules, no exceptions especially 15.


1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally
killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.

2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game
e. When your Date is using her teeth

4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours.

5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move
a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident

6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:
a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is  off
limits forever, unless you actually marry her.

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's  running

late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl,  you
have
to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic

1-10 scale.

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is
forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.

10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for  another

man. (In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly
optional.)

11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops,  not the

weakest.

12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies'  girlfriends
within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make  nice
with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports
bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a  double
standard because it's twice as true).

13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do  not
appear in public wearing more than one swoosh.

14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you  may
always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never  ask
who's playing.

15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have  brought
her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the  purpose of

flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.

16. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed  to
kick another guy in the nuts.

18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.

19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.

20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't  see
nothin'.

21. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated  as
spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the  ability to
pick a buffalo wing clean (chicken wing).

22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the  death of a

girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire
and threw it into a ceiling fan.

23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman  must
remain sober enough to fight.

24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice  of
pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.

25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be  talking
about his choice of beer.

26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of  yours,
except if she's withholding sex pending your response.

27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting
weights:
a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!
b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!
c. Another set and we can hit the showers!
d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?

28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal  footing:

both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other  situations, an

almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.

29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than  you
are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone;  Hang
up if necessary.

30. When a buddy is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him  only in

a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.

31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a  massive
hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he
thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the
loudspeaker every seven minutes.

32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a  friend"
have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and

guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion  about
what a big mistake it was.

33. Always split aces and eights. No arguments.

Don't forget that it is August again and time to  renew those hunting license's.  We will be leaving to go to Mason on the  evening of Aug. 31st and hunting early that Saturday morning.  Just a  reminder to get your license before we leave on that Friday.  We are  staying at the Willow Creek Ranch homes.  I just wanted to let everyone  know so someone can remember where we are staying.
 
Also, Wednesday evening seems to be a good time for  Pizza and Beer at Kenneally's on Shepherd.  Around 7:00 p.m.  I will  see you there.  Well those of you who can make it.
 
Scott
