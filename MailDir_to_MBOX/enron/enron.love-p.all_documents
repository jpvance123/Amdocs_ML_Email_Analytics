We have made some slight changes to the orig schedule and may make a few more 
per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.  It is 
vitally important that we do two things with this file now.  We must fill in 
all columns on the first tab - orig schedule and we must put all orig deals 
in the schedule - even if no orig is granted.  THis policy is in effect 
starting today.  Shout with any questions.

Just a quick reminder to please go into your books and flip all the ECC deals 
to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today for both January and February 
start dates.

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in 
TAGG, so please see her if you have questions on this.

Please let me know when all the January deals have been fixed so I can start 
the invoicing process.  

Thanks for your help.

Phillip,

Andy Lewis is setting up a new gas daily index and I need to map the correct 
indexes in EOL.  I am assuming for IF GD/D NGPL MidCont, it needs to be 
mapped as IF-NGPL/MIDCON and I need the GDP index for NGPL/MIDCON.  Can you 
please let me know at your earliest convenience?

Thanks,
Dawn

Tell you what Chad, you win.  I really am tired of banging my head against a 
wall talking to an irrational person.  I was not trying to make fun of your 
school, you chose that route.  I was trying to make a simple point that 
recruiting at Enron does not make a school elite.  Does NASA recruit at LSU?  
Does IBM?  Who cares? The point once again, we were talking about SPORTS!!!!  
See you in Baton Rouge in September.  Go ahead and respond, so that way you 
have the "last word".

 Scott was placed on the injured list by the Spurs with tendinitis in his=

points and eight rebounds. Don't expect any type of Fantasy production from=
=20
Scott this season.  =20

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Cato joined the team in San Francisco and will practice Wednesday.  He is=
=20
not expected to be activated for Thursday's game with the Warriors but expe=
ct=20
him to return befor next week.  Cato is a good rebounder  and shot blocker=
=20
but he doesn't play enough to have value in smaller Fantasy leagues.     =
=20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Richardson missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is=
=20
listed as day-to-day. Richardson has played well since Tyrone Nesby was=20
traded to Washington, but his Fantasy value is still very questionable. Kee=
p=20
track of  Richardson to see if he can post any consistent numbers before=20
considering him for your roster.  =20

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 12/13/00=20
 Miles missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is liste=
d=20
as day-to-day. The rookie has averaged only 6.2 points per game thus far, a=
nd=20
has no real Fantasy value at this point in the season.  =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/13/00=20
 Bryant jammed his right little finger on a dunk during Tuesday night's los=
s=20
to the Bucks. He continued to play with his finger wrapped, finishing the=
=20
game with 25 points on only 8-of-31 shooting. The diagnosis on the finger w=
as=20
only a sprain, and X-rays were negative. The injury doesn't figure to slow=
=20
down Bryant, who has become one of the strongest players in the world of=20
Fantasy this year.   =20

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Sura did not dress for Tuesday night's game against the Blazers. He is=20
battling a strained left hamstring, and is listed as day-to-day due to the=
=20
injury. Sura has averaged 8.5 points and 5.5 assists through his first 11=
=20
games. The former Florida State star does have some Fantasy value, especial=
ly=20
in deeper leagues, but don't expect a double-digit scoring average like the=
=20
one he posted a year ago in Cleveland.   =20

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Head Coach Tim Floyd said that Miller could return from his broken hand as=
=20
early as next Tuesday against Indiana. A more likely scenario, however, wou=
ld=20
have Miller coming back on Dec. 21 in Orlando. Miller, who has missed 17=20
games thus far, was averaging 6.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. With th=
e=20
lack of talent at center, Miller could be useful to those Fantasy owners in=
=20
deeper leagues.    =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/13/00=20
 Coleman returned to practice this week and looked good during workouts,=20
according to Head Coach Paul Silas. "He's moving, practicing and running th=
e=20
court well," said Silas. The Hornets hope to have Coleman back for their=20
six-game West Coast road trip beginning on Dec. 28. Coleman does have some=
=20
Fantasy value, but don't expect his numbers to equal his 1999-'00 totals=20
until he gets back into playing shape.  =20

 Bryce Drew , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Drew, who has been sidelined with a strained hamstring, participated in hi=
s=20
first full practice on Tuesday and may return to the Bulls in time for Frid=
ay=20
night's game against Atlanta. Drew had averaged six points in four games=20
before going on the injured list on Nov. 11. With a number of point guards =
on=20
the Bulls' roster, minutes are likely to be spread around, which decreases=
=20
Drew's Fantasy value significantly. He isn't worth a roster spot at this=20
point. =20

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Thorpe, who has been out the last month with a foot injury, was activated=
=20
for Wednesday's game against Sacramento. The veteran has very little Fantas=
y=20
value, especially on a very talented Charlotte frontcourt.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/13/00=20
 After a successful return to the court on Monday night, Hill may have take=
n=20
a step back during Wednesday night's loss to the Supersonics. He left the=
=20
game with 1:39 remaining because of discomfort in his ankle, the same ankle=
=20
which has hampered him all season long. "My ankle felt good in the first=20
quarter, but as we got into the third and fourth quarters, it got sore," sa=
id=20
Hill. "It was hurting a lot and I was a liability out there for our=20
ballclub." His status for Orlando's game against Portland on Friday night i=
s=20
uncertain. The news can't be encouraging to Fantasy owners who have Hill on=
=20
their roster, especially if he can't play effectively on a nightly basis.  =
 =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=
ht=20
ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games th=
is=20
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, s=
o=20
keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the=20
waiver wire.   =20

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=
=20
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=
=20
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries an=
d=20
will be easy prey for Wallace.  =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of=20
Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver sa=
y=20
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel=20
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston=20
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll=20
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Congrats on the future addition.  We are all doing good.  Jackson is 20 
months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our 
toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate 
program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is 
Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the 
requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he 
interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be 
able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is 
not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every 
form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for.

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

David, per my telephone message to you today, I am attaching a resume for 
Lena Zhu.  Lena is needing to relocate from our Portland office as soon as 
possible.  We have to find a home for her immediately.  Her choices are very 
slim; therefore, she cannot be very picky at this time.  She was originally 
needing to move out of the program in August, 2001 but her time has been 
extended to December, 2001 at which time, she will need promote to an 
Associate.  Please review her resume and if you are interested in talking to 
Lena, you may call her directly.  I will contact you to discuss your interest.


Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Second Presidential Debate Transcript
>
>Jim Lehrer: Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice
>President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on
>these rules:
>I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question and deliver
>rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters. The
opponent
>will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens

>into voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper
>softly while he continues to spew  incomprehensible statistics for three
>more minutes.
>
>Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name of
a
>downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
>strains the bounds of common sense?
>Gore: As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love
>the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage,
the
>downtrodden have a clear choice in this election. My opponent wants to
>cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand,
>want
>to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad lockbox so they can't hurt
old
>people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight. Mrs.
>Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for

>gas so that
>she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me. Also,
>herpoodle
>has arthritis.
>
>Lehrer: Gov. Bush, your rebuttal.
>
>Bush: Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying
>with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I
>want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my

>opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush.
>
>Lehrer: Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic
>were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able
to
>pronounce his name?
>
>Bush: The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy
>and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about
>that
>guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick would
>present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then Dick would
>tell me
>which one to choose. You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough
>foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New
>Mexico.
>
>Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your rebuttal.
>
>Gore: Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in.
>I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of poison
>gas in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And
>when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a
>way
>that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. If I'm entrusted with
>the office of president, I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat,
>foreign or domestic, by putting it in an iron clad lockbox. Because the
>American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple
>metaphors.
>
>Lehrer: Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security
>system?
>
>Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I have
>proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to
>every
>senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny
>until
>the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the next
10
>years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free
>to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them
>with the child-proof cap.
>
>Lehrer: Gov. Bush?
>
>Bush: That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to
>do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm
going
>to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof
the
>sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.
>
>Lehrer: It's time for closing statements.
>
>Gore: I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but I
>will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the

>White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.
>Bush: It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no
>onebut Republicans.
>
>Lehrer: Good night.

Did you watch our boy Rudy Saturday night?  170 yards rushing and was the man 
in OT.  He is a stud, luckily he has said that he will be coming back next 
year.  Are you guys still thinking of maybe joining us skiing?  Hope so.

kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly.

The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Patrick Mulvany

Phillip,

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the 
following pages in the
p/l found in this directory...

O: Erms/1Intra/Central/Midwest P&L/2001/0101/EMW0117.xls

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Thanks for the help,

Kevin

Hello!

I will meet you in the middle. . .work until noon on Friday, and then get out 
of here.  It is hard to justify our team taking the entire day off since our 
responsbilities are not completely dependent on daily trading activities or 
nomination activities.  That, of course, IS TRUE for Logistics and Risk.

To be consistent, I will give the OA team the same info.  Volume Mgmt. and 
Settlements will be jealous.

Thanks,
Carrie

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

According to the trader, this is a gas daily daily for the balance of month.  
This may be a hedge for them for a physical deal, but it is financial from 
our perspective.

Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central

highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I 
then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and

Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank

It was good to talk to you live.  I miss our chats, but this is the wrong 
time and place to discuss that.  Please do not fret at all about not asking 
me to stand up.  For what it is worth I didn't ask you either.  I think you 
are correct it would have been akward for both of us.  This week is a time 
when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that 
are pulling at you.  So you know, do not worry about us, we are there to 
celebrate with you and meet your family.  Take care of the other high 
maintenance people, because you will be suprised how many there are.  Try and 
relax and enjoy it.  I am looking forward to seeing you in that dress.  See 
you soon.

Hey Phillip, I am in the office now...but will be leaving soon and will not
be working the rest of the week.  We should chat live.  But...as for as
Friday goes...I am giving each room a guest box.  And in the box is a
map/tour guide of things you can do.  The luncheon....well, other than my
brother (and not totally sure he is coming...but will know tonight) you are
the only guy invited...and Ashely of course.  If you were a girl (which I
am happy you are not) you would be in my wedding party....and the lunch is
a way to say thanks to those close to me.  If you and Ashley can't come b/c
Grandma, etc....I totally understand.  Please do not feel obligated.  But,
can you please let me know...I have to give the restaurant a head count.  I
am still working on Thursday night.  BUT....worst case...check with the
front desk.  I will leave where we are, or what the plans are if in fact I
am not there.  I'll try and call you tonight.  OK..I am not nervous...but I
am losing my mind right now!!  Too many things to do!!!  Anyhow...did want
to let you know that I really thought about having you in Jason's wedding
party....but then thought it might not be the most appropriate.  Might have
been a little weird.  Just wanted to let you know that I did think about
you.

I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any
way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?
Since we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?
I know there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?
Wasn't really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her
grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.
Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon.

I recieved the following message from Phillip in which you requested our 
physical book org codes and what Tagg book name it is associated with.  Below 
is a list for the central desk.  If you need any other info let me know.

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy
The Associated Press
3/18/2001 
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the 
worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not 
be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. 
When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was 
essentially fired. 
"Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the 
season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told 
that and came and negotiated out of his contract," Muse said. 
More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum
Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose 
team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did 
not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. 
"That's how David and I worked," Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview 
from his Orlando home. "We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted 
me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be 
enough (to save his job)." 
Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the 
meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. 
Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until "the wee hours of the morning," 
then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and "urged 
him to stay until the end of the season." 
Muse said that was "the most celebrated case" of Lowder taking such a direct 
role in athletic decisions, but "there are many others." 
Bowden often commented that "Mr. Lowder hired me" and that the coach had 
"regular contact" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke 
with Lowder "weekly, if not daily" during his first two or three seasons, but 
"never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I 
should do it." 
Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search 
committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 
1993. 
"Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me 
hired," said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. "There's no doubt 
about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn." 
Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his 
coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling 
the strings on that decision. 
Bowden "always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of 
Lowder's influence," Muse said. "So he believed very strongly that he had to 
maintain that relationship." 
Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime 
defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. 
Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's 
successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff 
Ellis has "very, very frequent contact" with the Montgomery banker. 
Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. 
Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' 
athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide "support and input" to the 
president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive 
accomplishments and "stop bickering."

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks

Can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount (numbers at the bottom of 
your schedule) for Ontario thru 0008.  It appears that the number will be 
roughly 25K in income, making the number 255K unexplained and that will be 
for the months 0009-0011.

Can we also do the same on Central through 0006, this will be roughly 56K in 
expenses.  This will clean up that as well.

Please shout if there are any problems.  Thanks.

Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back with you, I had to leave town 
unexpectedly and just returned today.  All of that sounds great, how about 
putting the file in the O drive under erms/1intra/central.  Please name the

The Aurora liquidation tagg is N65007.2

The NGPL variance is primarily the following:
                                                           
N50101.X                   2,221.50
              N70658.3              131,316.55            
                                                           
NQ1900.1               (15,596.02)

Sorry, my notes were getting a little hard to follow on some of those cells.

0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora 
liquidation tsf from the East
Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn 
storage?

 WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara 
#384296 12/00-2/01.  This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own 
line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.

cc: =20
Subject: Capital Book

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=
=20
target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book 
variance as well on the other side.  Portfolio accounting should have a 
variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will 
look).  This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.  I will 
start looking for dec info you just requested.

Here is the email reminder of the curve setting process.  After you set your 
curves(do not hit finished file), go to the GD Pmgr tab and change the date 
in the left hand corner to two business days out(Friday set for Tuesday).  
Then go to the CurveFetch tab and place your file on automatic calc(can not 
hit F9).  Then hit fetch Prices button.  Prices should be brought in for 
current date.  Go to the AutoCurve tab and hit paste curves.  When this is 
done, hit finished file and the date will be updated so that I know your 
curves are ready to load in ERMS.  Please feel free to shout with any 
questions.  Thanks.

Ok, Phillip, here's the story I was given by Jim Little, you tell me if it 
makes sense.  In January this liquidation was out of the intra-month book.  
Sometime betwen January and August, the liquidation was changed to the  
FTbook and we don't liquidate out of the FT book, so the expected offset 
didn't happen.

I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...

Cathy please seperate two items from your original list.  TAGG#N50101.C for 
$897,332 and TAGG#N70687.7 for $659,979.  These two liquidations relate to a 
NGPL storage deal on the desk that should have variances for several months.  
The net amount of these two liquidations is $237,353.  For now, please  put 
this item on the backpage on it's own line.  We will reconcile the other 
storage lines in the next few weeks and see what if anything needs to be 
added to this line.  At that time we will work out the necessary steps to get 
this item off of the backpage.  Scott is still looking at TAGG#N38268.L for 
$1,443,519 for the remainder of the balance for May.  Shout with any 
questions.

Subject: Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information 
(dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to 
Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen 
email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's 
internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would 
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared 
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are 
questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the 
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being 
distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info 
back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called 
Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential 
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email 
address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the 
IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  
Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their 
terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

Invitations will be going out this week.


We need your photos!  Open the attachment or check it out online to find out
more...
http://www.clhs90.com/release4.pdf


The following is the plain text version of the attached file
-------------------------------------------------------------

SEND US YOUR PHOTOS!
http://www.clhs90.com

"Memories...all alone in the moonlight..."

Remember that song? Well, now your moonlit memories can be forever captured
in cyberspace. (Well at least for a while anyway!)  We're putting together
an electronic "scrapbook" for our website, and we need your help to make it
truly representative of our class.

So how can you help?  Well, we'd would love it if you would send us five to
fifteen pictures to help us get it up and running.  When you send us your
photos, we'll group them by theme (e.g. "football" or "drama") or by your
name.  If you want, you can even write a few lines explaining each photo.
To see what the scrapbook section will look like,  please visit:
http://www.clhs90.com/scrapbook/

Basically, we think it would be boring if all the pictures in the scrapbook
were of us.  So, please, please, please send us your pictures!  C'mon. It'll
be fun!

If you want your photo memories up on the web, you have a few options.

1.  Mail them to Geneen Pipher-Boyd at 4519 71st Street #1909; Lubbock,
Texas 79424.  She'll scan them and mail them back to you within 48 hours.
2.  Send them via e-mail either as gifs or jpegs  (check for acceptability
of other file formats) to csgp@ttuhsc.edu.

Question: How do I get my photos in electronic format?
Answers:  Use a digital camera to take your pictures. Scan traditional
photos.  This can be done with your own scanner or at a print shop like
Kinko's (most locations offer scanning services for a nominal fee). Finally,
many drugstores now offer to put your photos on a CD-ROM when you take your
film in for processing.

3.  Or, if you're in the Houston area, you can arrange a photo swap with
Kathy (Voigt) Nuernberg. You can arrange this by contacting Kathy at
kathy@nuernberg-online.com .

I am planning on taking vacation 5/11 and 5/14.  Attached you will find a 
copy of the Deal Validation desk procedures that will help you out with the 
Deal Validation process.  It would be to your benefit if you took some time 
next week to sit with me for a couple of days in the morning before I go on 
vacation so that we can go over any questions or concerns you may have.  
Please take time to read these desk procedures before next week as it will 
help you better understand the Deal Validation process when you sit with me.

Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed in 
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own 
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will 
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we 
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so that 
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even 
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie

this is the kid from opelika correct?  I heard when he committed last week, 
all the publications took him from a 5 star to four star.  SOunds like a 
little biased alabama propaganda.

I talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in PaPa's 
name.  He was telling me to call him anytime I am down there and he will get 
us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center.  Sounds like 
a lot of fun.  Let me know if you are interested during football season.

Hello!

As you know (all too well!), your job does not offer you all of the 
flexibility that you might like.  In an effort to give you a little more free 
time, we will start with the following plan.

What's a late day and who gets them?
Each book calc'er will sign up for a  one late day a month.  A late day is 
defined as a  one in which you do not come into the office until 3 p.m.   

When can I have one?
The late days to sign up for include any day Monday-Friday (excluding bid 
week thru 2nd workday).  Only one person can be out with a late day each 
day.  

Who's my back-up?
When you enjoy your late day, your back-up as defined below is responsible 
for your activities until 3 p.m.  If the following back-up schedule needs to 
change, let's make that quickly.  If you need additional security access to 
back-up someone, then put that request in immediately.  Each of the back-ups 
should "swap" jobs for a few days (until 3 p.m. to practice your 
responsibilities).  

If the back-up plan is successful, then we can potentially expand our 
creative work schedule possibilities.  We must prove that it will work, 
however, before can take any more steps.

When do we start?
All regions will implement in June. . .Irena will coordinate the calendar 
next week.

Let me know what you think!
Carrie

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify 
accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the 
second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes 
second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are 
out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams 
remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a 
charitable deduction for your $10).

Subject: duplicate deals

Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating 
duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate 
books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight 
deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the 
problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this 
afternoon.  

Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate 
deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.  
Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late 
last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward 
this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the 
Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it.

I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this 
may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Thanks,
Dawn

So am I.  I heard through the grapevine that we will be heading out to 
Ditka's for your birthday on Thursday?  I also heard rumors that they may be 
closing that casino down.  I hope it is not before Jazz Fest.

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

Phillip - this fall is nearing it's end for recruiting.  Schools are selected 
by an executive committee and program management.  I suggest that early next 
spring, you contact Celeste Roberts and discuss your request with her.  
Celeste is my Director, however she is out on maternity leave at this time.

Thank you
Shelly

I just wanted to update you guys on the status of the EMW reports for 
Hunter.  The EMW Positions_1 file is now updated and accurate.  Every night 
when Kevin finishes his P&L file and updates the EMW Positions file, he will 
email the entire central team.  If one of us is still here, we can print out 
the necessary reports and leave them on Hunter's desk.  If no one is here, 
the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to 
Hunter with the Var report.  

For the time being Hunter will be the only one needing these reports, I will 
communicate any change in distribution that he requests.  Also for the time 
being, we will be going into Kevin's P&L file, which is in the same location 
as our intra month P&L's that we sign off on, and printing the four tabs that 
he has identified in the email attached.  When Hunter has time to review this 
format with me, we may make changes to the reports we print out.  The EMW 
positions_1 file is in the same location as our CE Positions_1 file.

Please as always, shout with any questions or concerns.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip,

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the 
following pages in the
p/l found in this directory...

O: Erms/1Intra/Central/Midwest P&L/2001/0101/EMW0117.xls

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Thanks for the help,

Kevin

Attached are the fred files for the requested months.  I have to revise the 
0002 column on the summary schedule.  I lumped everything by mistake into the 
FT adjustment column.  We have to have 2 of the liquidations tsf to 
Transport.  On this one, look at the recon variances tab and answer my 
questions.  On 9911 look at the AVAR tab.  The deals highlighted in brown is 
the one that gas accounting - Jim Little should be reviewing.  On 9909 look 
at the AVAR tab and the three deals highlighted in yellow.  You will notice 
some of the same deal numbers here.  Let me know what you think.

The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.  It 
appears the files were not prepared by risk.  I have prepared the files and 
attached them.  Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing?  
Thanks for your help, please call with questions.

FYI - not sure if anyone ahs been putting vacation time in on a time sheet.  
I got a report and most everyone's was blank.  If you believe this to be an 
error, see me and I will show you the list.  I am not calling anyone out for 
cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.  I draw your 
attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end 
of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to 
carry over 40 hrs.  Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 
hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.  I have attached the 
site for your time sheets.  You will need your P# and password to access, 
contact security if you do not have either.  If you need help filling this 
out, let me know.  I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two 
weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.  Thanks.

This deal is booked correctly.  The external fee, labeled exchange fee is the 
.145 cents per mm that we owe them for the exchange.  The confirmation letter 
is wrong.  The fee per Geoff Storey the trader is .145.  This is also known 
as a spread fee.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call 3-7376.

Subject: Consumers Energy

Elizabeth,

Can you check out Deal #'s 411921 (Sale) and 411937 (Purchase)?  Looks like a 
buy/sell where we sold to Consumers Energy in October (1,000,000 total at 
5.20) and bought it back from them in November.  Both deals have 0 rates so 
that's not a problem.  The problem is - there's an exchange fee on both deals 
of $0.0725.  But it's a negative fee on the sales side and a positive fee on 
the purchase side.  That means I would owe them a netted amount of $145,000.  
Is that right??  Should the sale side maybe be positive so the two sides net 
to 0 - or do we owe them this money??
Also, the confirmation letter for the sales side mentions a "spread fee" to 
be paid by Seller (ENA) of $155,000.  Could that $145,000 netted amount be a 
part of that?  And if so, where's the other $10,000?

So many questions!!  I have copies of the confirms if you need to see them.  
Let me know...

...Chuck

Sorry I did not get back with you yesterday.  We have been really busy around 
here.  I called the person that I gave your resume to and she is on a 
business trip until early next week.  Her assistant is going to have her call 
me when she returns.  Apparently she left the day after I gave her the 
resume.  I will keep you informed.  If you look on our website www.enron.com 
and you see anything that interests you, let me know and I will put the 
resume in.  Talk to you soon.

Per Bass-
like last year we get 13 guys, one must remain on IR for the entire week.  
Note - the person does not have to be injured.

Pickups and drops are every monday.

If you do not know how to add/drop, ask any of us from last year.

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

Here is the file.  We used Victor's transport model that he uses for all of 
the other transport deals.  The omicron volatility curve that we used was 11 
- the same as other Chigate deals.  Give me a shout with any questions.

How are things in Denver?  I haven't heard from you in a while and I thought 
I would drop you a line.  I have the picture of all of us from that mexican 
food restaurant off of Westheimer under my mouse pad and I was thinking about 
you.

How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new 
living situation?  It can be tough at first, but as long as you are patient, 
everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  

Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible.  
They blew another 7 run lead last night.  At least the stadium is really 
nice, otherwise I would be very dissappointed that I got tickets.  I hope 
your parents are still enjoying the seats. 

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Dependent Child Information

If you have viewed your benefit elections on eHROnline, then you may of 
noticed the missing coverage amount for Child Life Insurance.   For Child 
Life Insurance, you will be able to see the coverage cost of $.42 per pay 
period.  However, the amount of coverage will reflect $0.00.  

During conversion to SAP, we discovered that there was no dependent child 
record created, we need immediate action from you

Please respond to this email by Thursday, June 29 by 3:00 p.m. with your 
child's name, date of birth and social security number.  Once we have entered 
all dependent data in SAP your amount of coverage will reflect $10,000 per 
child in eHROnline.

Thank you,
Ginger McCain
Benefits Analyst

These deals are not even on my desk.  All but the physical forward belong to 
the Price Desk.  the physical foward is a Texas desk deal.  You should 
contact the leads of those two risk groups - Errol McLaughlin and Dave 
Baumbach respectively.  Sorry I can't help.

Thanks for the thoughts.  Sorry it has taken me a few days, work has been 
really crazy.  Sounds like you are doing a little more travelling huh?  How 
do you like it?  I will keep your cell number and try and give you a call to 
talk in real life.  Looking forward to seeing you guys during easter.  
Hopefully we will not be heading to alabama for the weekend.  Talk to you 
soon.  Thanks again.

Hey Phillip-

I am really sorry to hear about your grandfather.  It must have taken alot
of courage to say the eulogy, and I am sure that your grandfather would
have been proud.  If you do want to talk about it in "real life" please
call.  I am on a plane to St. Paul for the next three days, but can be
reached on my cell phone.  That number is 303.669.2296.  I am glad that I
was able to give you some sort of peace, even if it was in a dream.  I
always hate to hear someone I care about is hurt, especially when I can't
do anything about it.

Easter is only 2 1/2 months away........

Sounds good to me.  We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.  We look
forward to seeing you in April.

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the
funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I
bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my
emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts.
I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.  Wild
huh?

Talk to you soon.

Hey Phillip-

I talked with Jason...and I think we have to lean towards not this year.
We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I
believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to
bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other
kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week.

The Paul Harvey Philosophy

These things I wish  for each of you.....
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that  we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like  for them to know 
about hand-me
down clothes and homemade ice cream and  leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I 
really would. I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you 
learn honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn  to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I 
really
hope nobody  gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.

It will be good if at  least one time you can see puppies born and your old 
dog put to
sleep. I hope  you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.

I hope you  have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all 
right if  you
have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to  crawl 
under the
covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When  you want to 
see a movie
and your little sister wants to tag along, I hope  you'll let her.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your  friends and that you live 
in a
town where you can do it safely. On rainy days  when you have to catch a 
ride, I hope
you don't ask your 'driver' to drop you  two blocks away so you won't be seen 
riding
with someone as uncool as your  Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad
teaches you how to make one  instead of buying one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read  books. When you learn to use 
computers,
I hope you also learn to add and  subtract in your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you  have your first crush on a 
girl, and
when you talk back to your mother that  you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a  mountain, burn your hand on a stove and 
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a beer once, 
but I hope you don't like it. And if a  friend offers you dope or a joint, I 
hope you realize he is not your  friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma and  go fishing 
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.

I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a  baseball through a 
neighbor's
window and that she hugs you and kisses you at  Christmas time when you give 
her a mold of your hand.

These things I wish  for you: tough times and disappointment, hard work and 
happiness.
To me, it's  the only way to appreciate life.

Send this to all of your friends that  mean the most to you but, don't send 
it back to
whoever sent it to you. They  have already read it and you don't need to show 
them that you are a good friend.  They already know!

"We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by  doing them."

Paul Harvey - "Good Day"!

There appears to be about 7 people that are not going to make it, leaving us 
about 5 people.  Therefore, as we agreed several seasons ago, every body 
needs to drop ten bucks in the kitty for the forfeit deposit.

the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.  This 
also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in 
the curve table.  This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.  Thanks for

As is the case will all FT-Ontario deals done at a US point, the deal must 
flow physically from a US book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long 
term income/loss from the deal.  This is a commercial decision that risk has 
to abide by.  The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the 
deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat 
performances.  This deal in question began in 11/00 and since you are doing 
december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.  I suggest 
forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.  Thanks.

I just wanted to respond to your email and let you know the thought process 
of the book move for Ontario.  This move was requested by the trader 10 days 
ago.  We notified Curtis Smith and Bill Kasemervisz the following business 
day last Monday - July 24th.  For future reference, please let us know 
exactly how much notice is required and if you think there are other groups 
we may have missed notifying so that this does not become a problem again.  
Thanks for your help.

Hello!

As we enter the new year, I think we should all be reminded of Enron's work 
hour policies and the environment in which we operate.

Enron supports and encourages flexible work hours (7:30-4:30, 8:00-5:00, 
8:30-5:30, part-time, etc.).  Additionally, the policies allow us generous 
personal time, family time, sick leave, vacation time, etc.  We are supported 
and encouraged to put our health and families first. 

This culture allow us many freedoms, and it does not dictate a 
"clock-watcher" mentality.  However, we are all paid to give Enron a minimum 
of a 40 hour work week (or some other agreed upon part-time amount).  This 40 
hours does not include your lunch hour.  

As you are all aware, many of our fellow co-workers on the 30th floor are

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

I put together a spreadsheet to look at the lone liquidations we have on the 
summary pages that we will be presenting today and then looking at what is 
going to hit in the next month.  All the turnarounds you mentioned to me for 
January did happen, but in total we booked another $4 million of expense.  
This spreadsheet lists the lone liquidations from November and December 
production down the far left column and ties to our current summary 
schedule.  I put the new liquidations from January production on the right.  
I hope this is useful to you.



Thanks,
Cathy

Dawn,
thanks for putting this information in the paper.  Hopefully a student from 
Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.

A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H. Burgess has been set up at the school of 
Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.  The scholarship has been ear 
marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an 
interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess 
dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he 
practiced for 35 years.

If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you 
can do so as follows:
Auburn University Foundation
c/o Sam Hendrix
317 South College Street
Auburn University, AL 36849

Please make checks payable to the Auburn University Foundation
Any contributions are fully tax deductible
Any questions, please contact Dr. Burgess' grandson Phillip Love 281-486-7026

Please feel free to modify this in any way.  Thanks for your assistance.

Subject: New Bridge Monitor

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

Subject: Trader Web-site Information

Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

Shirley McDowell
Project Manager/Trader Web-site

I have made a slight revision to the template regarding CPR Cash In and CPR  
Cash Out for consistency between Accounting, OA, and Economics.  

OA CODE 15 CASH IN  SALE
OA CODE 14 CASH OUT PURCHASE

Please replace the previous template with the one below.  





Thank You ,

Attached is a file listing all of the curves we had that posted as 0 price 
for 3/31/01.  We need these pub posted as the same price as the 30th - prices 
are included in this file.  We need these pub posted ASAP so that we can 
flash march detail.  Risk does not have authorization to override an existing 
pub posting, this is why we need your help.  If you have any questions, 
please give me a shout.  Thanks for your help.

Sounds good to me.  We just wanted to invite you guys anyway.  We look 
forward to seeing you in April.

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the 
funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I 
bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my 
emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts.  
I actually had a dream this morning about talking to you about it.  Wild huh?

Talk to you soon.

Hey Phillip-

I talked with Jason...and I think we have to lean towards not this year.
We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I
believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to
bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other
kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week.

below.  This should eliminate interdesk variances.  You will need to add th=

Follow these steps when entering data:

exactly as it does on your desk level summary report from CPR. =20
2. Select the "counterparty name" involved in the transaction.  It also=20
should appear exactly as it does on your desk level summary report.=20
3. Enter the Volume and Dollars.  No need to summarize the numbers under on=

Please provide me with any feedback by Thursday, February 22 if the templat=

These two deals, 249262 & 565833 are changed for February out.  I will tell 
the risk team that all new deals at NGPL/Nipsco should be at NIPS/NGPL - 
9260.  Is this correct?

Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

Shirley McDowell
Project Manager/Trader Web-site

Attached is the file with the appropriate liquidations that should match the 
transport expense variance.  We are within a few thousands dollars of the 
variance using these calculated liquidation amounts.  They are all physical 
annuities in the FT-Ont-Central book.  I am getting the post ids unarchived 
to verify that they were in the flash financial liquidations.  Please tell me 
if you have these in the FT file, I have already checked Jim's intra physical 
and financial files for Ontario and came up empty.  My thinking(hoping) on 
this issue is that  the liquidations will be flashed and not captured in the 
GL.  Give me a shout with any questions.

Phillip,

I think I told you that my boss, LTC Dowling, has decided to retire from the
Army.  He is real interested in moving to Houston.  He has family there.  A
guy he knows (who apparently works for Enron, but I'm not sure) suggested he
try there for a job.  while we were travelling together last week, we were
at Applebys, eating dinner and watching the Astro's.  I mentioned that mys
son's company paid a bunch of money for that stadium.  When Ed heard that,
he asked if you might take a resume in for him.  I kind of volunteered you.
Then I got to thinking, I think I remember you saying that you get some kind
of reward if they hire someone you recommend.

In my opinion, and you know I have those, any company that gets this guy has
found a gold mine.

If it's a problem, I'll understand.  But if it's possible, I'd really
appreciate you taking a copy of this to Enron.  And, by the way, I told Ed
several weeks ago, before I knew he was retiring, that if and when he needed
my help, call me and I'd come work for him again.  So, who knows, if he gets
on in Houston, I might get an opportunity to move there too.

Thanks,

Pop

P.S.  Don't forget, I'll be out of town most of the week.

Congratulations.  I thought you said you were done after one?  I am sure your 
son will absolutely love having someone to play with.  I just got back from a 
week off, so I am swamped.  I am now the business controller for our desk, so 
I have reviews and a million other things to catch up on.  We will have to

Sorry for losing my cool with you earlier.  I have had a difficult few weeks 
with some people in your group and took some of my frustration with them out 
on you.  Thanks for your help and thanks for not ripping on me too hard.  
Hope you have a good weekend.

All of our documentation says 4.78.  If they want to pay us a penny more, I 
will take it.  I changed the price for January.  If this same problem arises 
again in Feb, let me know.  I am curious why they agreed with 4.78 for 
nov-dec.

Government News Keywords: MILITARY COURTESY TO THE PRESIDENT Source: CNN
Posted on 02/15/2001 11:44:53 PST by Hurtgen
This morning CNN showed George W. leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step
saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right
face to stand facing GW's back...something that was missing in eight years
of the Clinton presidency.
The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new
president. That one goes back to the days in the rigging, when the marine
orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of
movement, to be ready to receive an order.
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone?
..And for eight years, they did.

I meant to email you over the weekend to let you know it was on it's way.  
Just be sure to fill out the matching gifts form.  Please let me know if 
there is any hold up on that.  

Looks like we will not make it back to Auburn until the fall for football 
season.  I will give you a call a few weeks before we come in to set up a 
tour of the raptor center/vet school.  Thanks again for your help in 
completing this special occasion for my family.

Talk to you soon.

Phillip ... wanted to let you know the check arrived this past week and
I've taken it to accounting for deposit.  We will await the Enron match.

Thank you again, and especially for thinking about having Enron match the
family's gifts to this memorial scholarship. That will help it add up in a
hurry.

Do you know when you will be in Auburn next?

Attached is the liquidation support for July.  I am still in the process of 
tying these deals to the General Ledger and currently the difference is 
sitting in the Texas Region as the problem is most likely related to the 
financial deals on Co. 12.  Please do your research as usual and I will give 
you a detailed list of any changes if it relates to your region.

Southern Company Energy Marketing, LP has changed its name to Mirant Americas 
Energy Marketing, LP.  It was a name overlay so you won't see Southern in the

Phillip, if I left anyone out of your group, please forward this on.

Thanks!!

The rest of that list is misleading, etc. etc. etc.!

Glenda,
Hope everything is going well for you guys.  I just wanted to take a minute 
and thank you for the easter  gift you sent Jackson.  It was very 
thoughtful.  He has enjoyed coloring the book and everything else he can get 
his hands on.  He also ate all of the chocolate as fast as he could.  He is 
getting really big and really independent.  We are headed to Jazz fest this 
weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.  Take 
care and we will talk to you soon.  Thanks again.
Love,
Jackson, Ashley & Phillip

FYI - those of you running firm books.  These adjustments described below are 
due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.  In the future, we 
need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E.  Schedule C should be 
used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other 
adjustments.  Shout with any questions.

Jeff,

I need your help with a few items.  In the DPR rolls for several books this 
month there were topside adjustments inserted.  It was my understanding that 
all topsides would be included on the associated roll schedules (Sch E and 
Sch C).  Investigating all of these is greatly increasing our reconciliation 
time.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Here are a few 
books that had topsides:

MTM Topsides that should have been on Schedule C
GD-Central
FT-Texas
FT-Central
Liquidation topsides that should have been on Schedule E
GD-Central
FT-Northwest
FT-Ontario

Let me know if you need more information or if there is anything we can do to 
help.  Thanks.

Does Denise have any interest in learning to ski?  I think it is an absolute 
blast.  How are the negotiations going between Gwynn and the Padres?

Jeff-

How is it going ?  My friend, Brett Turner, just graduated from LSU with a 
Masters in Finance.  He has a job offer from Credit Suisse First Boston in 
their London office, but would like to investigate opportunities in Houston.  
I reviewed his resume and it looks like he could be a good fit for Risk 
Management.  Brett is a sharp guy who is extremely motivated.  Could you 
please review his resume (attached) and let me know what you think.  

Try not to hold it against him that he is an LSU Tiger and a friend of mine.

Thanks,

CKL

Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 
Sithe's P&L.

1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this 
revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction 
in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe 
Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a 
financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's 
invoices.
3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the 
FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be 
modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial 
annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule 
B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the 
FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the 
FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).

These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish 
the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks.

Kam--

There was a typo for the gas volume that was used in Stacey's worksheet
to calculate the gas price.  The original spreadsheet had 11,240 Dth/day
and a gas price of $11.126/ Dth.  When you use the correct volume of
22,263 Dth/day, the gas price drops to $5.6172 for Day 1 in the attached
file.  This corrects the double-counting I told you about this morning. 

The spreadheets you sent to me calculate the power keep whole expense
on the "Gas Price" sheet.  On the sheet, it is the sum of $3,880,560 ( i.e. 
the correct
number if Day 31 is actualized rather than estimated by the power curves).

Unfortunately, Stacey's calculation does not include the transport commodity
savings, the tax expense and the amount of sharing due Sithe.  Those numbers
were provided in my memo on Friday.  If we do one of these deals again, we 
can provide Stacey with the additional expenses and revenues so that it can
be perfect calculation.  

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth

Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
$265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.

Sam-
Here is a little something about my grandfather:

 Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic 
Institute, now Auburn University.  He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years 
in Haleyville, Alabama.  Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 
grandchildren and one great grandchild.  Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and 
tremendous football fan.  He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 
years.  Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University 
in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.  Dr Burgess was a World War II 
veteran.  Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and 
both grandchildren to school on the plains.  Due to his love for Auburn that 
he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation 
Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.  Dr. Burgess was also a proud member 
of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.  Dr. Burgess was born in 
Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.  

Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the 
things I stated above.  Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and 
the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.  Auburn is very 
fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important 
school within the University. Talk to you soon.

maybe you guys can finally beat us now that we have so many guys going to the

Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man




The ties that bind 
Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times
10/03/00
By PHILLIP MARSHALL 
Times Sports Staff 


AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.

Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as 
head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years 
of trouble, despair and losing.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. 
''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.''
On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a 
small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback 
Heath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter 
turns it can take.

A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters 
and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about 
football. It was about matters of the heart.

''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip 
linebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the 
itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. 
We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just 
lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''

Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November 
night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has 
grown ever stronger.

It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's 
Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi 
State.

Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in 
the most difficult times.

Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly 
under control, threatened his senior season.

''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you 
for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my 
health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and 
every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was 
crying.

''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through 
something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to 
look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''

On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. 
Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad 
times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for 
their teammates and their school.

''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get 
along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys 
urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to 
get better.

''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and 
understand what it's going to take for us to win.''

The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.

''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little 
group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in 
your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''

It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college 
football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then 
came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.

They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They 
take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.

No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He 
went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when 
hardly anyone thought he could.

Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.

''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 
'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is 
worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. 
Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this 
team are like brothers.''

Leard says nothing that happens can change that.

''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special 
seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. 
We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.

''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to 
practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being 
pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''

Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of 
blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one 
who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.

''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example 
of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger 
people but for all of us.''

WHat time are you coming to Jock's & Jill's tomorrow?  I will be there around 
11 a.m.  Are you doing anything tomorrow night?  I hear the Gold club 
calling.  I am staying at the Holiday Inn at the Airport.  There is also a 
big boxing match tomorrow night - Vargas and Trinidad - should be a dandy.

I agree with Bryan.  Judging by the number of email's he is sending, it looks 
like he doesn't have enough work over there.  I am sure the Texas boys could 
use his help on calcing the books.  I will try and limit my smack talking 
next week and I think someone else needs to jam Mick's finger before next 
week's game, it seemed to help him free throw shooting last night.

I just went to look at the file and the data is yesterday's data.  We need 
the current prices that are set each day at roughly 12:10 for the gas day of 
the next day.  Please let me know if this does not make sense.  Thanks.

FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does 
not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the 
value.
Thanks again.

Subject: changing deal locations

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.

Hello, everyone.  I just wanted to let you know as of December 1, 2000,
this will no longer be a valid email address.

My new email address is Lostincorpus@aol.com

It seems fitting on several degrees.  I hope everyone had a good
Thanksgiving.

Love Ya,

Ines.

Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system 
for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing 
tonight.  Thanks.

Jim

There are two items in the June Central Fred file that we need help with:

NB0242.B    $768,761    Phillip says this is not Central's.  Can you take a 
look?
Transport    $480,272    Can you provide any detail for what is included here?


Thanks for your help.

Cathy

One of the saddest parts of the demise of Alabama coach Mike DuBose is his
growing inability to control the bad apples in the program.
A few of Alabama's players, sensing DuBose's lame-duck status, have been
acting like thugs. The latest example of the inmates running the asylum:
On the final play of the Tide's loss to Central Florida, senior fullback
Dustin McClintock blocked Central Florida freshman Commer Rucker to the
ground, sat on him and reportedly punched him several times in the face.
DuBose told one reporter he didn't want to comment until he spoke to
McClintock.
According to media reports in Alabama, DuBose is "concerned" that something
like that had happened for the second week in a row. Concerned enough to
take harsh disciplinary action such as suspending the guilty party for part
of the next game?
Cheap shots are getting to be a habit at Bama. In the closing minutes of the
Tennessee game, Alabama's Hirchel Bolden took out his frustrations with a
shot to the chin of UT punter David Leaverton, who was nearly 45 yards from
where the punt was rolling on the turf. Leaverton required 9 stitches to his
face.
Because no penalty was called, some Tide supporters defended Bolden. The
following day, DuBose said such behavior wouldn't be tolerated. However, his
threat rings hollow because he never backed it up with stiff sanctions.
McClintock obviously never got the message. His actions and DuBose's
reaction (or lack thereof) speak volumes about the state of the Tide's
program.

Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.
Julie

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.

The tagg number for the january piece is QP7914.  This deal was put in after 
the fact - Feb.  so, we will have a variance in January that should be offset 
in February.  This is due to the information not getting to us in time to 
change the customer price in Sitara before we flashed Jan.  The sitara number 
that this all relates to is 543246.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

Good afternoon Phillip.  My name is Scott Schaunaman.
We spoke yesterday regarding engineering opportunities
at Enron.  I am currently seeking a position as a
junior-project engineer.

My background is in gas pipeline simulation and design
as well as miscellaneous project management for
pipeline terminals.  I currently work at Fluor Daniel
in Pipeline Engineering.  I am seeking a position with
an operating company as a junior-project engineer with
responsibilities in project cost, scheduling,
engineering, safety, environmental, and construction
supervision for pipeline projects. If you are aware of
any such opportunity, I would be interested in
pursuing a career with Enron.  Please see the attached
resume for more details regarding my qualifications.
If you have any questions or require additional
information, please feel free to contact me via e-mail
(saschaunaman@yahoo.com), or at 281-263-5667. Thanks
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to
hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Scott Schaunaman

P.S. Great game last night.  I was getting concerned
about losing our first game on our new turf.  The last
2 innings were great.  Have a good one.

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
Phillip

Attached is the book request.  Could you please process as soon as possible.  
We are flipping Geoff Storey's book tonight to a us book(price and basis 
split out) and we will need an index book.  Sorry for the short notice, we 
were working with IT to get the conversion and just found out today that they 
did not set up a new index book.  Thanks for your help, and call with any 
questions.

Jim,
Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.  
This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.  The 
Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.  
Please shout with any questions.  Jennifer, this should eliminate the current 
outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have 
been cleaned up.  The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due 
to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.  I believe the 
variances will be a gain.
Thanks for you help guys.

three books....Get the point.  We are all busy, welcome to Enron.  I think 
the point of the message, which I think should be directed at a few 
individuals that have shown a pattern..DON'T COMMITT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING 
YOU DO NOT INTEND TO DELIVER UPON.

Just to keep you posted....

The offsetting liquidations($1,000,000 in revenue) for these two deals was 
sitting in the West Fred file.  It looks West already took this to the desk, 
so Theresa will get with Darren to reverse their take and reclass this to 
Central.

Thanks for your help with this.

the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - 
QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 
should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the 
other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 
respectively.  Shout with any questions.  This should explain about 900,000 
of the lone liquidation problem from January.

Due to the significant amount of activity on EnronOnline, and the large 
number of users logged into the system during peak trading hours, please 
inform your respective teams that they should not use the EnronOnline 
applications (Reports, Product Manger, Profile Manager, and Data Manager) 
between the hours of 7:30am and 10:00am.  Only those actions that are 
absolutely critical should be performed (i.e. credit headroom adjustments, 
etc.).  

The IT group is reviewing the database in an attempt to make our queries more 
efficient, but until further notice, these guidelines should be followed.

Please call me if you have any questions.

There is a file that may be useful to you guys.  It will show you all first

If you ever have a question about your gas daily swaps and what curves to use

Jim

In addition to the problem with Central June that I emailed you a follow-up 
note just a few minutes ago, we also need help resolving the following:

In October, there is a variance for NY6237.1  for $200,880.00 between the 
NG-Price and the Intra-Central books.  Per Phillip, there should be an offset 
for this and there shouldn't be a variance.

In September there are the following variances that we need help identifying:
Oil-NG-H         $150,239.97
Exotic-T             324,397.00

In August, there is a variance for EW4539.2 for $(744,999.95).  Per Phillip, 
this should be offset with leg 3 and there should not be a variance.

Jeff Gossett is adamant about getting the financial liquidation variances 
cleared before next month and we really need your help resolving these.

Thanks,
Cathy

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.

Brain,
 Also Jackson Logan should not be in 103817, but should be in 103833.  

 Mick Walters went to HPL, effective March 15.  And before then he was in 
cost center 103833, not 103817.

P lease reclass and let me know when this is complete.
 

tThank you,

Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical 
liquidations:


Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the 
pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.  All three of 
these equalled the 3.7 million.  You should use the revised and the capacity 
hedge file.  When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a 
variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).  This amount should be a 
"desk adjustment".  We have accounted for the variance in our current month 
(0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.  Please shout with 
any questions.

Subject: Risk Meeting notes

Here are the top issues which the top performers in risk identified in this 
morning's meeting in no particular order:

1.  All physical curves out by 2:30.  All financial curves out by 3:15.  
2.  Streamline nightly checkout process.
3.  No more deal tickets.
4. Systems person or persons on the floor.
5. Notification of any curve change in the system.
6. Specific cut off time for all deal tickets.
7. Cross regional training
8. Stock options
9.  Back-ups for all big books
10. Combat Pay
11. Only 2nd yr analysts.
12. Automatic notification when a deal has been changed.  (Canada,  
Logistics,  or trader)

I don't think any of these requests is unreasonable.

Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.  After 4 days in Vegas, 
please check your scores - I am still in a daze.  Kansas - please forward 
attachment to your friend Kris, Denver forward to Josh Stevens and John 
Swinney please forward to Rob Fullen.  Here are the list of people I still 
need money from:
Josh Stevens
Denver Plachy
Jimmy Simien
Eric Bass
Flannigan
Jason Wolfe

Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score 
is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).

Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is 
$307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  

The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game 
by COB Today(total score for final game):
Jason Wolfe
Denver Plachy
Scott Earnest
Chad South
Doug Friedman
John Nowlan
Lee Jackson
John Swinney
Rob Fullen
Josh Stevens

If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  

Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
differential.

Thanks everyone for playing.

There has to be an adjustment in TAGG, because both the FT ONT and FT NY 
books have captured this value and received the offsetting liquidation.  If 
the IM NY and IM ONT books have offsetting value you can roar reclass the 
difference.

Jim,  Were you able to locate this liquidation for April.  I realize it has 
been booked in TAGG between FT books, however, can you somehow get the value 
in  IM Ontario?  Let me know if I can provide you with any additional 
information that will help resolve this issue.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

Sounds great.  We will have to meet up somewhere.  We are staying at the 
NY,NY under my name.  

I feel the same.  I really enjoy seeing you, but as usual, the visits are too 
short.  We will just have to make more frequent trips to Denver.

I will write more later, trying to get caught up from a week off.

Jackson did get the gift for Christmas from you, the thank you card should be 
in the mail.  Thanks.

First....like always it was awesome to see you and the family.  I always
hate saying good-bye to you....but what can you do??  Second....did Jackson
ever receive something in the mail from me for Christmas?  I received a
note from Amazon asking.....and thought that was weird...so thought I would
ask you.  Oh...I think Jason and I will be in Vegas the same weekend as
you!!!!  The only down side is that he will want to spend time with the
other people going out...they are his best friends from Iowa...........I'll
figure something out....even if I have to break away by myself.......

> An election for new members of the Auburn Alumni Association's board
> turned so ugly Saturday that first the voting was postponed and then,
> after a state judge was called in, the whole thing was scrapped. The judge
> ordered the association to hold a new election in two weeks.
> Voting for a new slate of alumni leaders is traditionally a low-key
> affair, but it turned into high drama when an alternative slate of
> candidates was put forward at the last minute and at least 150 people
> showed up to vote. Beneath all the accusations -- that proxies were

> whether to amend the state constitution to change the way that Auburn's
> trustees are elected. If the referendum passes, as it is expected to,
> leaders of the alumni association will have a say in the selection of
> trustees.
> The amendment calls for the creation of a nominating committee consisting
> of the governor, two trustees, and two directors of the alumni
> association's board. Currently, trustees are appointed by the governor.
> On Saturday, seven nominees -- a new president, vice president, and five
> other members -- were to have been elected to the association's board. The
> slate, which was put forward in July by the association's nominating
> committee, included some people who have pushed for changes in the way
> that Auburn's trustees are elected. The proposed changes on this year's
> ballot include a measure that would establish term limits for Auburn's
> trustees and that would allow alumni who live outside of Alabama to serve
> as trustees, as well as involve alumni leaders in the selection of
> trustees. That's the legislation that will go before voters.
> Less than a week before the alumni association vote was to take place, an
> alternative slate for all the posts but president was put forward by the
> nominee for president, Golda McDaniels. Ms. McDaniels could not be reached
> for comment, but critics of the new slate believe that Ms. McDaniel was
> nervous about whether she would really be elected and sought proxy votes
> in her behalf from many alumni, including a controversial and long-time
> Auburn trustee, Robert E. Lowder.
> Mr. Lowder has opposed efforts to change the way trustees are selected,
> and his critics speculate that he saw an opening when Ms. McDaniels asked
> for his support: He planned to get her to put forward a whole new slate
> for all the other posts to be elected by proxy votes. The suggestion is
> that Mr. Lowder wanted to "take over" the alumni association so he and his
> allies could maintain control over the Board of Trustees.
> "We failed to realize the steps that Mr. Lowder will go to to not allow
> any alumni involvement in the election of trustees," said Andy Hornsby, a
> nominee to the alumni association's board and an outspoken advocate of
> changing the trustee-selection process.
> Mr. Lowder called the charges "ridiculous." He said his only involvement

> give it. "I was just trying to help the lady," he said, noting that she
> would be the first woman elected president of the alumni association. "I
> get blamed for everything over there," he said. Mr. Lowder accused the
> supporters of the original slate of improperly adjourning the meeting
> because they didn't have enough proxy votes to win.
> While Auburn's homecoming game against Louisiana Tech was going on, alumni
> leaders were meeting in Lee County Circuit Court, where Judge Jake Walker

LTC Dowling, 
I will do everything I can to get you to Houston, for selfish reasons.  I 
know if you move here, there is a good chance my Dad will follow you.  Thanks 
for the info and if you see a position on the website that I miss, just let 
me know and I will get your resume down there.  Have a good weekend.

Subject: Canadian Logic uploaded this weekend into EOL

Jeff and Kathy,

After much testing, the logic will be placed into production this evening 
that will book the two legs for the counterparties that have master 
agreements with ECC and hit a US product.  I have had Victor Guggenheim 
review the following deals in tagg stage but you may want to review as well 
and let me know if everything looks alright.

QT8025  Dynegy Canada
QT8034  TransCanada

This logic will create the two legs for the price and basis swaps when a 
counterparty with a master agreement with ECC hits a US product.  The first 
leg will be between ECC and the external counterparty and risk assigned to 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS.  The second leg is simply the flip from FT-US/CAND-ERMS to 
the appropriate US book (the book mapped at the product level).   These 
examples illustrate this logic.  This logic is also set up for the 40+ 
counterparties that have the master agreements with ECC.

If you see any problems with the example deals or in the logic described 
above, please call me before end of business today so we can stop this from 
going into production.  Please forward to you groups to inform them of the 
change.  Please let us immediately if something is not correct on these deals 
on Monday.

Thank you,
Dawn

Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?  I figure you spend 
so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.  I have a coworker going up 
there next month and it is their first time to chicago.  I gave them Etta

other?  Thanks.

Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central 
1 & Central 2.  The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.  I 
highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I 
then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and 
let us know what type of detailed support you will need.  Thanks.

Did you not hear me.  I said I was talking athletics.  Do you want me to 
break out academics with you?  I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn.  
Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.   Behind the service 
academies, more astronauts than any other university.  Top ten among 
universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.  

The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.  Just 
because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior 
academically.  I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or 
Auburn, in terms of academic stature.  You should know that recruiting at 
Enron has and will always be political.  You have to have someone from that 
school in upper managment request trips be made.  I can promise you in the 
next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.  I and anothe alum have 
already discussed it with HR.

The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - 
QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 
should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the 
other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 
respectively.  Shout with any questions.  This should explain about 900,000 
of the lone liquidation problem from January.

FYI,
The system is now open and you should have recieved an email regarding 
access.  You need to select 5 people to review you.  Please select people 
from different groups and I would suggest putting your trader on the list.  
Also, please send me a list of accomplishments for this six months.  This 
will help me in drafting my review to help represent you in the review 
meetings.  If you were not an enron employee on 1/1/2001, you will not be 
ranked with other members or your job classification, but you will still 
recieve a review.  Please shout with any questions.  Don't forget the 
deadlines from the original email.

If you look in tagg, the sitara deal number is in the comments section - 
#372156.  If any of you guys want us to come up and show you how to use tagg 
or what we do to find these numbers, give me a shout.  The deal is 
liquidating in the Ontario book because the Ontario trader did the deal.  If 
that trader does a deal at a US point, the gas has to physically flow out of 
a US book, not a canadian book.  This deal is only for one month, so this 
will not make Jim Little's recurring list that he automatically transfers for 
you guys.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  I also got some 
message from Souad that you need some help with a People's deal.  She thought 
you said you emailed me on the deal and I do not have an email, let me know 
if you still need assistance with that issue.  Thanks.

Phillip,

I have tried unsuccessfully to detemine the SITARA number for
TAGG deal #NW0078.3

I suspect it should be in CENTRAL and not ONTARIO.
Please advise.

Thanks,

Aurora N65007.2 0008 lone liquidation belongs to sitara #307241.  We should 
have had a form on this.  The deal came to the desk at mid and would require 
a liquidation.  You should have a variance on your compare reports.  If not,

Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a 
financial liquidation problem from 0007.  I have a deal NR2989.1 that is 
showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production 
month.  When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to 
NG-Price.  I do not believe this should be in the central region.  Any 
assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had 
yesterday regarding financial liquidations.  Thanks for your help guys.  
Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin. liq.

FYI, I got a message from Elizabeth Hernanadez that we are missing a few of 
these sitara numbers in tagg when we are booking deals.  She fixed the ones 
we missed yesterday.  Please put these numbers in because it is vital to 
resolving OA variances that we are able to tie tagg deals to sitara.

We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in 
sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated 
properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.  Would 
you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the 
other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines 
on other desks.  For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one 
sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.  This would simply be an 
additional step to verify all deals are being captured.  Hopefully this will 
eliminate any future problems.  If you have any suggestions for ways to 
better handle this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Questions for Hunter:
1. What are the position limits for the traders on the central desk, maximum 
long or short?
2. What are the steps to evaluating a trade with a third party?
3. How does a trader set their curves?  What information/knowledge is 
required?
4. What information or tools, besides NYMEX, do you use to gage the market?

Carrie, that is all I can come up with right now, I will keep thinking and 
let you know if anything comes up.

FYI,

I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind.  
So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new 
deal problems.  Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and 
new deals should be tied out before calcing.  I know you guys almost always 
do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be 
watching us even closer now.  

Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra 
month trader.  I also heard this request from Hunter.

Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work.

Phillip and Kam

I put together spreadsheets summarizing the variances for Enron Canada 
purchases and sales for the Ontario region for August and it looks like we 
have a similar situation to July in that there are two liquidations on the 
purchase side that don't reference any particular Sitara deal that are 
directly offset in the liquidations for Transcanada Pipeline sales.  If we 
net these two liquidations, it significantly reduces both variances.  The 
Taggs are N63076.8 and 2 and N63076.C and 6.  



Thanks,
Cathy

I apologize.  The deal confirmation group down here instructed me to book 
these deals this way.  I am in the process of rebooking these deals as we 
speak.  They will be fixed within the hour.

That deal is one deal.  My trader likes to see it broken out in two deals.  
You will see that one deal is priced at zero and the basis adjustment in on 
the other leg.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

What's up in the hood?  It sounds like you guys live in Compton instead of 
San Diego?  Make sure Emma starts packing when she starts kindergarten.  If 
she is strapped, she can shoot back at these SOBs.  Yet another reason Texas 
is better than Cali - we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because 
they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass.  

Do you guys want me to order you Jazz Fest tickets when I order ours?  I am 
putting in an order for alot of people because if I mail order them it only 
costs $3 total as opposed to ticket master's $3 fee per ticket.  Since I am 
ordering ours this way, I can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket 
price(I eat the $3 because I am doing ours this way anyway).  The tickets are 
$15 through the mail per day as opposed to $20 at the gate and $18 through 
ticketmaster.  Let me know.  I am ordering all three days for ashley and I 
hoping we go all three days.

Asa & Joy,

I just wanted to take a minute and thank the two of you for your generosity 
this past week.  My friends and I had a terrific time and everyone really 
enjoyed your condo.  The weather was terrific and the fish put up a 
formidable challenge.  We are very interested in renting the condo from you 
guys during the season this year.  I requested that the cleaning charges this 
time be put on my credit card.  Please let me know if  they charge you guys 
anything.  Thanks again.  We look forward to seeing you guys soon.
Phillip

Subject: NCAA tournament

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

Subject: Gas Curves

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.


 






SIncerely,

BM

We will take the MTM variance for 0010 - 441K - this is partially offset by 
Central's variance.  This is related due to the changing fo the transport 
book from GD-Central to Intra-Ontario.

I have to say, I would be offended by that prayer too.  FYI, I will be in 
town this weekend(Haleyville).  We are packing up PaPa's stuff on Saturday if 
you want to come by and hang out.  Mom and I are probably going to head out 
Saturday afternoon.  Just a thought.

Please provide me a list of deal numbers that need to be changed.  From you 
email I gather you are saying that all deals done by ENA with a Canadian 
Counterparty need to be ECC/3rd party and then flipped to ENA 
book/FT-US/Cand/ERMS.  Is this correct?

I changed the first deal, the second one NZ3403, Kam got a call from credit 
that this should be with ECC.  We have a sheat from Bruce Mills that says all 
deals with Dynegy Canada should be through ECC.

You can ask fabiola.  We are not in a bind we are still waiting on a few 
people to get back with us.  I think ashley was calling Monica and Jaime to 
see if they were interested and Ricky and Tanya.  The only bad thing is they 
have to let us know tomorrow if they are interested.  Sorry you are unable to 
make it, maybe next year.

Hey...it looks like we aren't going to be able to make it.  Jason told me
to go with girlfriends.....and I really thought about it.  I remembered
that I had a wedding in April (girl at my wedding from Tampa) and found out
yesterday that it is April 21.  So..if I am traveling every week and am in
Tampa the 21 (Jason is not going)..and then Jazz Fest the following
week...it will be three weeks that I don't see him.  I just don't think
that is a wise move on my part.  Although I really want to go!!

Does this put you in a weird bind re: not enough people in the rooms, etc.?
If it does, please let me know.  I know Fabiola was leaning on going...so
maybe I could follow-up with her.

I don't know if this is true but I know I am going to check it out for
myself.

Subject: all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine are being recalled

A friend sent this to me and I just wanted to pass it on. I know I'm going
to clean out my medicine chest. Before I forwarded this message to anyone I

wanted to make sure that the information was true.  I checked with Rachel's

pediatrician and she verified that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine

are being recalled. I also happened to be at CVS Pharmacy and they have a
sign stating that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine have been pulled

from their shelves.

You  may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and
inquire about a refund.

Please read this carefully, as I know that some of you use some of these
drugs (Alka Seltzer Plus for one).  Also, please pass this on to everyone
you know.

Stop taking anything containing this ingredient. It has been linked to
increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in brain) among women ages 18-49 in
the three days after starting use of medication. Problems were not found in

men, but the FDA recommended that everyone (even children) seek
alternative medicine. The following medications contain
Phenylpropanolamine:

Acutrim Diet Gum Appetite Suppressant Plus Dietary Supplements
Acutrim Maximum Strength Appetite Control
Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold medicine (cherry or orange)
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine Original
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Cough Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Flu Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Sinus Effervescent
Alka Seltzer Plus Night-Time Cold Medicine Effervescent
BC Allergy Sinus Cold Powder
BC Sinus Cold Powder
Comtrex Deep Chest Cold & Congestion Relief
Comtrex Flu Therapy & Fever Relief Day & Night
Contac 12-Hour Cold Capsules
Contac 12 Hour Caplets
Coricidin D Cold, Flu & Sinus
Dexatrim Caffeine Free
Dexatrim Extended Duration
Dexatrim Gelcaps
Dexatrim Vitamin C/Caffeine Free
Dimetapp Cold & Allergy Chewable Tablets
Dimetapp Cold & Cough Liqui-Gels
Dimetapp DM Cold & Cough Elixir
Dimetapp Elixir
Dimetapp 4 Hour Liquid Gels
Dimetapp 4 Hour Tablets
Dimetapp 12 Hour Extentabs Tablets
Naldecon DX Pediatric Drops
Permathene Mega-16
Robitussin CF
Tavist-D 12 Hour Relief of Sinus & Nasal Congestion
Triaminic DM Cough Relief
Triaminic Expectorant Chest & Head Congestion
Triaminic Syrup Cold & Allergy
Triaminic Triaminicol Cold & Cough

I just found out and called the 800# for Triaminic and they
informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following medicines
because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures
in children.

Orange 3D Cold & Allergy
Cherry (Pink) 3D Cold & Cough
Berry 3D Cough Relief
Yellow 3D Expectorant

They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number on the

box so they can send you postage for you to send it back to them, and they
will also issue you a refund.

If you know of anyone else with small children, please pass this on.

His sister was older and she lived in New Jersey, no idea of the name.  
Unfortunately I was going to check on the internet for death records and any 
inmate records(he was a little wild).  Do you have any idea about that stuff?

Your career by the way sounds very exciting, I would like to hear more.  
Thanks for the efforts, I have really been wondering about this guy for a few 
years.

There were two negative originations in the central gas daily book.  One in

Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of 
SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.  
Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.

Jim

It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative 
originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July 
through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are 
you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance?

Thanks,
Cathy

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD

Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti 

From: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
To: "'Jonah H.  Peretti'" <peretti@media.mit.edu> 
Subject: RE:  Your NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

Attached are the spreadsheets you requested.  The first tab - 100 is the same 
sheet as the one we discussed earlier.  The second tab 60.40 is the sheet 
that assumes Tom only gets 40% and Sharpe gets the asset deals.  The third 
tab is the revised summary sheet for all months if the 60.40 split is the 
route we choose to go.  Please feel free to give me a call with any 
questions.  Thanks.

Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system 
for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing

I'm not sure if you were forwarded this message yesterday, so I'm sending it

Could you please flip the deals that are in your book to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS

Hi guys,

Could you please go through all your books and see if there are any ECC deals 
in them for April or May settlements.  I've gone through a few and here are 
some deals that need to be flipped before noon tomorrow at the latest as I 
need to invoice them tomorrow.

FT-EAST



G-DAILY-EST



GD-CENTRAL



Please make sure that all these deals are flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book 
before noon Houston time on May first.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey

Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have 
attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 
1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination 
was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.  
The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by 
originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will 
update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value 
was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you 
every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let 
me know.

If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please 
let me know.  Thanks.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Jim

There are two items in the June Central Fred file that we need help with:

NB0242.B    $768,761    Phillip says this is not Central's.  Can you take a 
look?
Transport    $480,272    Can you provide any detail for what is included here?


Thanks for your help.

I wanted to let you guys know that I changed the files.  I had one deal with 
FT Central that was in the physical file that was financial.  I transferred 
the deal to Sheetal's file.  I also added the sitara numbers to the physical

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

We can take the 265k if you find that we already took the existing variances.

Phillip, 

I can reclass this to synthetic storage.  It looks like we may have netted 
the pre-existing synthetic storage valance with some other variances and 
taken it to the desk in the October,November time frame....

Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
$265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.

I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

I am going to try and capture the accomplishments I feel are relevant.  
Hopefully you will agree:
1.  Cleaned up oustanding Ontario operational analysis variances that 
extended up to 18 mos. of age
2.  Assisted in the transition of the ontario book to a US book
3. Resolved roughly 5 million in operational analysis variances due to 
synthetic storage
4.  Assisted in the training of new team members
5. Assisted in the modification of the Operational Analysis process(phase 2 
requirements and form completion)
6. Survived first six months in risk

The price is $5.40 canadian dollars as referenced on TAGG #NI7771.2.  Due to 
TAGG constraints, the deal had to be booked as two legs in tagg to capture 
the canadian price.

I left Bob a message last week and again today that teh Utilicorp price is 
right in sitara and tagg, the confirm should have gone out at IF Ventura + 
.1825.  My understanding from the conversation with Bob was that the confirm 
had not gone out yet, however, the trader got a phone call today that the 
deal got confirmed at the wrong price.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
PL

Hi Philip,

Is the price for Deal NI7771 5.40 or Index because TAGG = 0 and Sitara = 5.40.
Please advise.

Also, Bob Bowen has spoken with you on Friday regarding a confirmation that 
was sent with the wrong price, counterparty is Utilicorp.
Has the price been updated in the system and could you forward me the deal 
number and I will revise and re-send?

Thanks
Jennifer

I got an update from Bryce.  In the back of the publication for 1/2/01(page 
7), there are prices for the 30th & 31st.  It appears the 30th & 31st got pub 
posted at the first page of the 1/2/01 publication.  Therefore, we are going 
to see OA on these deals.

FYI,
I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the 
central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced 
deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came 
out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated 
the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on 
the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed 
gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 
2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's 
price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to 
give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be 
seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my 
logic, please give me a shout. Thanks.

Darron talked the higher ups here into making me the business controller for 
the Central desk.  So now my hours are longer and responsibility greater all 
for the same pay.  I guess I did n't have to do the stupid thing and accept, 
but oh well.  We will see if I can handle another year in risk.  Talk to you

Subject: Schedule

All,

John Valdes asked us to prepare a list of the items that we need/would like 
to see and when they are needed.  We have been putting together a timetable 
of Gas/Portfolio Accounting data as well and it is included at the bottom of 
this email.  Keep in mind that the timetable for what we would like to see 
and our data is based on all handoffs happening smoothly (ie if the desks 
don't flash until the 3rd workday we know we will not get WACOGS until that 
point).

Here are the items we have come up with to this point as being needed from 
the OA Group:



We would also like to be included in the Regional OA meetings to help resolve 
some matters up front rather than from a schedule.

Here is a timetable for our data:



Additionally, all buyer reallcation entries should be received within 24 
hours after expense hits the GL.


Starting in January 2001 the 1999 OA packages were not produced.  The data is 
still available for research and is included in the matrix detail report from 
SAP.   To keep the number of OA packages to a manageable level we are 
proposing to drop a quarter at a time after we reach 18 months of data.  We 
will drop these on a non-quarter end.  For example, in July 2001 accounting 
we will stop producing the OA's for the first quarter of 2000.  By this point 
PMA's should be minimal and OA variances should be minimal.

Remember that the dates above are a guideline that we are shooting for and 
can change if the handoff of information is not timely.  Each group is 
working to clear the roadblocks they face to make this process work.  The key 
to the process is communication and fixing any problems at their root cause.  
Also keep in mind these deadlines are based on the current 6 workday close 
process.  If close is accelerated, the above will have to be reworked.  
Please feel free to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

       Greg x35399

Thanks for the invite.  We are going to JasonTidwell's wededding in Galveston 
Saturday - it starts at 6 p.m.  We are not planning on staying too long and 
should be back in Clear Lake before 8 p.m.  We will go pick up Jackson and 
shoot over if that is ok.

Who bought the house?  I hate to hear that they are leaving so soon.  When 
does your dad have to go back to the middle east?  

I do not care if what you guys have to drink, thanks for thinking of me with 
the no bud products.  

When do you guys get in?  I am off tomorrow, so give me a call at the house.  
See you soon.  Looking forward to seeing you guys.

Subject: Easter Weekend



Hi All!

Jason, Steve, Drew and I will be in town for the weekend and would love to
spend time with you all.  You are all (including kids, of course!!) invited
to my folks house on Saturday for a bbq.  I am thinking 5:30 ish (or before
if you want to hang out!!).

Most of you know, my parents purchased a house in Colorado.  Last week they
sold the house in Houston...actually some people who graduated in Phillip's
class bought it (Phillip - I need to ask you about this one!) and will
moving out at the end of May.  My Dad will be renting an apt. close to his
office (near the airport) until retirement (hopefully soon) and my parents
will commute back and forth b/t the two places.  For those who aren't able
to make it to Denver, this may be the last time to hang with the folks.

Please let me know if you and guests are able to come over and hang (food
and drink).  Also, any food/drink preferences (e.g., Phillip hates Bud
products).

Love you all,
Rach

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Good to hear from you as well.  Last I heard, you were running a dating 
service...What happened with that?

I have been at Enron for close to 3 years.  Ashley and I have a 18 month old 
son, Jackson.  Mom is doing good, as we all are.

How do you like Enron so far?  I absolutely love it.  I am in the Risk 
Management Group for Natural Gas Trading.  Dealing with the traders can be 
fun, but is usually quite challenging.  Unfortunately we have a lot of late 
nights waiting on systems - like we are right now.  What group are you with? 

Where are you living these days?  We just built a house in PineBrook in Clear 
Lake.  We had our ten year reunion last weekend...quite strange.

I don't know if you know them, but several CL graduates work here.  Meredith 
Mitchell, Dawn Kenne, Mike Pyer.

Our curves just came out, so I am going to start calcing my P&L.  Talk to you 
later.

FYI, 
Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.  The 
reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that 
should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as 
opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.  What 
typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes 
to the desk entirely at mid.  This is causing some substantial OA variances.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

good luck.   I would also suggest having a fire extinguisher handy as well.  
You can also always say the turkey is a Texas tradition - blackened.

Deer Valley is in Utah - 45 minutes outside Salt Lake City.  I got airfair 
from Houston for 200 per person.  

Have a happy turkey day.

OK - 
Here's the demographics on the south Florida voter - 

They can play 10 
bingo cards at a time and not miss a number. 


They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as 
well 
as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. 


They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in 
the 
Tri-fecta at the horse race. 


They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 
300 
yards away. 


They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 
200 
yds. 


They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the 
Greenpeace 
hotline. 

They can take 37 different colored pills every 
morning and never mess 
it up. 

But they can't read a 4-line 
ballot both published in the newspaper AND 

mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... 

You 
figure it out !!! 




Suddenly Florida makes Alabama and 
Mississippi look like geniuses.... 

? 

? 

"COME 
TO FLORIDA - The NEW Alabama......"

Subject: 2000 Individual goals

Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed in 
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own 
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will 
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we 
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so that 
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even 
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie

Spoke with Sheetal and she had a similar question.  We are putting our deals 
in TDS.  We do not have paper tickets.  I understand there is a meeting 
scheduled for the end of the week to discuss this issue.

Just wanted to follow up with you guys on a conversation we had in a recent 
staff meeting.  I personally have noticed a dramatic improvement in the phase 
I process that Elizabeth is responsible for.  She has definitely become more 
comfortable with the process and we are seeing significantly less entry 
errors.  I checked with the others, and these comments seem to reflect 
everyone's feelings.  Just thought I would update you guys.  Thanks.

How are things going?  Good I hope.  Give me a call when you get a chance I 
need to see about getting your phone number so that I can have you cut my 
mom's grass.  She is in need of a new lawncare service.  You ought to have 
your number listed so we can get a hold of you.  Thanks.

His name was Keith Corbo.  He graduated with us and went to Texas A&M.  He 
was is a fraternity Beta Theta Pi.  He dropped out and moved to Florida and 
worked at a bar(his dad had moved their).  The last time I talked to him was 
when he was in Florida in 1992 or 1993.  I can not find him anywhere.  He 
would definitely be in our senior year book.

I will try and put something out there today and I will get some pictures to 
send as well.

FYI - 
I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and 
booked to GD - Central.  This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to 
the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were 
incurred related to this orig.  Per Misti, this amount will come through in 
November and needs to be reclassed to July August adn September.  Cathy has 
the correct amounts on her back pages.  Please shout with any questions.

Phillip and/or Kam,

Jim Little booked some liquidation pmas in 10/00 GL for 05/00 production for 
Central region.  I'm not able to tie these taggs to a Sitara deal so I'm not 
sure what to do with them.  Can you help?

ND2875.3     Consumers Gas  93,000 revenue  Jim says this should probably be 
reclassed to Ontario, but I don't have any open issues related to Ontario and 
I       don't know what the Sitara link is.

EC3704.7     Enron Canada            19,848 revenue  The tagg references 
Sitara #313723 but when I try to open it, I get an access denied message, any 
clues what this       is? 

ND9423.1    Enron Canada 23,249 revenue I didn't see a Sitara reference on 
this tagg, either.

He also booked a pma for 760,000 of expense for Consumers on tagg NF9881.1 
but it looks to me like we've already booked this one in the original 
liquidation file, so I've asked him to research that one.

Thanks for your help.

Cathy

Can you please advise your groups to contact either EOL or Jay Krish or Dat 
Truong when you find a sitara hedge not linked to the sitara physical deal?  
Once you find this, please do not create or kill the hedge until the sitara 
team has a chance to look at the deals.

FYI - 
wanted to let you guys know about a few things:
1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there 
quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this 
opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for 
career development.
6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your 
training plans.

Please shout with any questions.

My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a 
better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.

I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms 
are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are 
usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas 
causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.

postings - if there is a particular job(s) he is interested in - have him 
forward the job number so i can try and get his resume to the correct

> As Accusations Fly, Judge Orders Auburn Alumni Association to Hold New
> Election
> By COURTNEY LEATHERMAN <mailto:courtney.leatherman@chronicle.com>
> An election for new members of the Auburn Alumni Association's board
> turned so ugly Saturday that first the voting was postponed and then,
> after a state judge was called in, the whole thing was scrapped. The judge
> ordered the association to hold a new election in two weeks.
> Voting for a new slate of alumni leaders is traditionally a low-key
> affair, but it turned into high drama when an alternative slate of
> candidates was put forward at the last minute and at least 150 people
> showed up to vote. Beneath all the accusations -- that proxies were
> improperly collected and that fax machines were jammed to prevent opposing
> votes -- is the real issue: Next month, voters in Alabama will decide
> whether to amend the state constitution to change the way that Auburn's
> trustees are elected. If the referendum passes, as it is expected to,
> leaders of the alumni association will have a say in the selection of
> trustees.
> The amendment calls for the creation of a nominating committee consisting
> of the governor, two trustees, and two directors of the alumni
> association's board. Currently, trustees are appointed by the governor.
> On Saturday, seven nominees -- a new president, vice president, and five
> other members -- were to have been elected to the association's board. The
> slate, which was put forward in July by the association's nominating
> committee, included some people who have pushed for changes in the way
> that Auburn's trustees are elected. The proposed changes on this year's
> ballot include a measure that would establish term limits for Auburn's
> trustees and that would allow alumni who live outside of Alabama to serve
> as trustees, as well as involve alumni leaders in the selection of
> trustees. That's the legislation that will go before voters.
> Less than a week before the alumni association vote was to take place, an
> alternative slate for all the posts but president was put forward by the
> nominee for president, Golda McDaniels. Ms. McDaniels could not be reached
> for comment, but critics of the new slate believe that Ms. McDaniel was
> nervous about whether she would really be elected and sought proxy votes

Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

Yeah man, tell me about that crazy night before.  You know us married guys 
have to live vicariously through our single friends.  Next time you are 
headed this way, please do give me a shout, we will have to get together and 
catch up.  We can shoot a little pool at my house or go out to a bar.  Good 
luck with the financing, please keep me informed.  Thanks for the nice 
thoughts, same goes from me bro, I have been thinking about you for some time 
and hoping things were going well, I am glad they are going well.

Funny, somebody else sent me the same e-mail, actually my ex-girlfriend.
How are you?  I don't think I mentioned that it was a tru pleasure to see
you, hug you, meet your lady, and re-experience the energy I get from being
in your company.  I'm very happy for you and where life is.  Now that I know
you're local, I'll e-mail you before I come down next time so we can
hopefully hang or where I can at least pop by.  I'd love to play with the
little one.  Allright bro, just wanted to share that with you,

Much love,

Tarek
 P.S. Tell Dawn I was disappointed I didn't get to see her.  By the way I
gotta tell ya sometime about the night before the reunion, it was rather
wild.  Also, keep your fingers crossed, we will have an answer on financing
for the after-hours joint by next Fri, everything is in.

I think Ashley sent Fab some info on the fest.  We have had to lock into the 
rooms last week, so I do not know if we will be able to help her get a room 
unless they still have some available when she makes a decision.  

Sorry to hear about your work life stinking.  I definitely know the feeling.  
The way I rationalize it is that I will take a job that has better hours 
before Jackson gets into school.  

On a happier note, we are going to dinner with your parents this weekend.  
Should be fun.  Talk to you soon - don't work too hard.

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...

Per your request, attached is the hedge strip file that we use to calculate 
your bench every night.  On one of the tabs R2, you will find your positions 
and a conversion factor.  I have tied these to the benchmark groups 
conversion factor numbers.  Let me know if we need some of these points 
changed, i.e. CGPR-DAWN's conversion factor is 0.  Shout with any questions.  
Thanks.

Please do not try and compare Louisiana to Alabama.  There is only one 
university in Louisiana.  You can not hold it against Auburn that 
Napoleonville has only been able to support one university.  Tulane is 
strictly academics and we are talking sports.

Subject: Gas Curves

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.


 






SIncerely,

I have been meaning to email you all day.  I  have been extremely busy as 
wel.  I am sorry to hear that.  Ashley and I were looking forward to going 
out to dinner with you guys on Saturday.  Maybe we will call your folks and 
see if they would like to go out for your dad's bday.  I will have to give 
him a call tomorrow to wish him happy birthday.  Do you have his number at 
work or an email at work?  Thanks.

We look forward to seeing you soon.  Take care.

Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Here is my breakdown of the December number of $1,460,000:
Fin Liq N05499.7    164,300
Fin Liq N08617.3    164,300
Transport Exp     174,300 (I will bring you detail)
Golden Gate Purchase Liq(N086173.1)  774,225
Pacific Gas & Electric Pur. Liq (N63900.5) (31,000)
Pacific Gas & Electri Pur Liq.(EV9437.7)  217,808

I have left out the California Energy Hub actual variance, because it nets 
with a PG&E Energy Trading(N05499.3) variance.

Hi guys,

Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that 
still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today.

FT-CENT     

QU4059.1

FT-NORTHWEST



FT-ONTARIO



FT-WEST



GD-CENTRAL



NG-EXOTIC

QY3631.1

NG-PRICE



These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking 
for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If 
you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your 
help

Stacey

All of these deals had their facilities changed by logistics on the last two 
days.  I have reiterated to Lisa Kinsey the importance of her group letting 
us know when they make a change in facility.  All of these were physical 
basis trades, so they came at contract - the desk price difference is not 
more than .04 on any of the deals.  OA therefore should be minimal.

holiday, so we can hang out.  Give me a shout.  Looking forward to it.  Did 
Jason go to Vegas this weekend?  I thought you had said he was going.  I had 
a blast, won about $650.  Talk to you soon.

That is all fine with me.  Just ask mom what she wants to do.  She will not 
flip out again, I think.  We can see if she wants to do anything on his 
actual birthday.  What are we going to actually do after the Gymboree thing, 
are we inviting anyone else over?

FUCH - it is great to hear from you.  How did you get my address?  What have 
you been up to?  

You won't believe it, but I am married(about 4 years) and have a son 
Jackson(not named after Bo) that is 15 months old.  We finally sold our old 
house and moved into a new one, that is about a mile south of my mom.  
Everything is going great for us here.  We are enjoying our new Astros 
ballpark, which happens to be named after my company.  Unfortunately, we are 
not getting any free tickets(at least the little people aren't).

Where are you living?  Are your parents still in Auburn?  How about your 
lovely sister?  I bet she is married with several children.  We go back to 
Auburn every football season for about three games, if you are ever in town, 
we will have to get together.

Clear Lake is having our ten year reunion this fall.  Should be fun.  I think 
you and I are the only two from that school to ever go to Auburn. 

Talk to you soon.
PLove

That is what I had for your address, just checking.  We had a blast with
your uncles as well.  We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.  I
guess we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at
the wedding.  I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.
I guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  Since I have a
small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have
special friends that you consider family.   Plus, you know how special you
have always been and will be to me.

Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.  Sad to hear you are
working my kind of hours now.  Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but
counting the days till my rotation to a new group.

Talk to you soon.

Hello!

I wanted to pass on a compliment that you all received this weekend. . . 

Jason Williams told me that the entire Central risk team was "extremely 
helpful and patient", that you "respond to requests with a great attitude," 
and that he was especially impressed with your responsive to the traders' 
requests even though these things cause you to stay later in the evening.

Keep it up!  You impress people!
Carrie

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Patrick Marchand, 5-5636.

Phillip,

Each month we (in accounting) pull the forward detail for the post ids which 
were officialized at month end.  For February 2001, these post ids are on the 
Report page in the FT Intra Ontario file but they are not officialized in 
RunM:

1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689

Were there other post ids which were officialized for these particular 
rolls?  If not, would you please officialize these so I can pull them.

Best regards,

Rachel

IF- Monchy,
according to the trader, the change in the basis curve was due to the

FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about 
unofficialized post id's.  We run a macro every night to verify these are 
officialized.  I just want to remind everyone that this is very important 
that we do this.  Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these 
errors continue.  Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on 
this currently.  Thanks.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

Oh....the old profit and loss.  I haven't had to deal with that nightmare 
since
MBA, which I can say I am happy about.  No, I did not throw away any pictures 
of
you.  Just Tom and the 2 I have of Justin (a.k.a. ass).  I would never do 
that!!
Should I even toy with the statement "things would be alot different"?  Just
kidding!!  No, I am sure we would be the best of friends like always.  Hey, do
you still have that picture your mom took of us forever ago?  Back in the day?
Just curious....sometimes I like to see how much I have aged!  About coming
home, I have no immediate plans for a visit.  I have been swamped.  My wedding
plans are coming along good and I am getting ready to move into Jason's (Dad 
is
not too happy about that one).  I think I will be in there by the second week 
of
May.  Anyhow, as soon as some time frees up I will come home.  When I do, do 
you
think you really will have a free schedule.....doubt that one!!  Family life 
(I
am sure) keeps you busy.  Hopefully this time I will be able to see your 
little
one.  OK, I am going to say one more thing I shouldn't (but what the
heck).....Ashley gave me a picture of me holding Jackson and I couldn't help 
but
wonder what if.  Sorry if that is bad.....but one day all of that will be 
gone.
Jason is completely wonderful..

Profit and Loss.  I forgot that you are in the touchy feely are of
corporate life.  The new position is very challenging and educational so
far.
I just found out that the last rockets game is on Wednesday of this week
and I have my softball league on that night.  I guess I will have to record
it and watch it later.  Oh, Well.
That is great about Kelly.  We have no immediate plans to add to the
family.  The one is keeping us plenty busy as it is.
I hope you didn't throw out any pictures of me last night(that would be
rude).  I am sure if we lived closer that things would be a lot different
and we would interact a lot more(outta site outta mind).
Do you have any plans to come back to town anytime soon?  Be sure and give
me some notice so that I can clear the old schedule.  Talk to you soon.

OK, not to be stupid but...what are P&Ls???  I suppose the management
consulting
world does not use that.  Well, I guess I figured that you would be staying
in
Houston.  Are you happy in your new position?  If you ever did come up
here, it
would be fabulous!!  Maybe we will settle on visits for now.

Dad would be really happy to go to the Rockets last game.  They were in
town
here last Tues., but I was in Seattle for work.

How are you liking your new house?  Are you and Ashley planning on any more
kids?  Any time soon?  Kelly Houge is preg. and is due November 28.  It
will be
weird not having her at my wedding.....

I was going through pictures last night....throwing out the ones that had
ex-boyfriends in them....and thought of you.  Not the ex-boyfriend
part...but I
did run into pics with you in them.  I really wish that we could be more a
part
of each other's lives.  It would be fun....maybe one day you really will
take a
job out here.  Wishful thinking I suppose!!

I got jimmy on last October.  He seems to be enjoying it.

The new stadium is phenomenal.  It really looks like an old time park.  I
need to call you dad and see if he wants to go to the rockets season
finale.  Rumor has it that Charles is going to play so that he can walk off
the court on his own power.

I just took another job within enron working for the east desk doing daily
gas P&L's.  Should be challenging with high exposure.  So, it looks like we
will not be coming to denver any time soon, with the exception of this
fall.

Your dad did look a little different, but I got used to it pretty quick.  I
am sure it will be a little more difficult for you.  Take care.

My

I noticed that Jimmy (from your email) is working for Enron...when did this

Are you still looking to transfer here....hurry up!!!!!

I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations 
file.  There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we 
flashed and what detail we now have.  We will have to take this adjustment to 
the P&L(wil be expense).  I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or 
LT Transport.  I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you 
each month by Cernosek's group.  For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed 
($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).  The detail in this 
file plus these three numbers should tie out.  If not, please let me know.  
Shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

That is what I had for your address, just checking.  We had a blast with your 
uncles as well.  We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.  I guess 
we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at the 
wedding.  I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.  I 
guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  Since I have a 
small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have special 
friends that you consider family.   Plus, you know how special you have 
always been and will be to me.

Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.  Sad to hear you are 
working my kind of hours now.  Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but 
counting the days till my rotation to a new group.

Talk to you soon.

I am in receipt of your OA forms for the purchase of gas from
Sithe for the month of December 2000.  These forms are not complete
in that they do not include the liquidations of the hedges that were
put into place to protect Enron from an unfavorable shift in prices.
These were power hedges

Addtionally, there were top-line entries that were flashed to more
accurately reflect what the actual prices were to be at the end
of the month. 

The top-line entries as well as the hedge liquidations all
need to be included to create a complete picture.  At this time I do
not have the tagg numbers or copies of the top line entries.  The
top line entries should be available from the flash files.

Please give me a call so that we can work together to resolve
this OA variance.

alot calmer now at home.  How is the little one?  Jackson is into 
everything.  Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and 
I hung out all day.  I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.  Ash was real 
proud.

Phillip, I rejected your security request because you already had access to 
Sitara.  I just modified your existing security profile by removing your 
access to the East and granting you access to the Central desk.  In order for 
the change to be effective, you will need to get completely out of all open 
Sitara applications and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call 
me at x35423.

After meeting with Larry Joe Hunter, we will not be granting tagg access to 
his group.  They were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the 
wrong counterparty.  The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do 
these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.  This is not an option.

Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.  We 
must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty 
initially.  Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line. If we do not have 
all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving 
enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.  FYI, this is going to be a 
highly visible area for us to make mistakes.  If we continue to make these 
mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.  To help us do this 
correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list 
on a monthlly basis.  We will still have emails sent denoting CP name 
changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future 
reference.  If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, 
please call Bianca Ornelas at  5-3782.

If you have any questions, please give me a shout.  Thanks.

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

Looks good to me. - I noticed a note on an ECC purchase - Q29840 - sitara 
killed, the wrong sitara number is on that tagg - the correct number is 
430538.  I made the change in tagg.  The transcanada liquidation that are not 
highlighted are the exchange deals that are not showing up in the GL.  This 
is the huge problem that seems to not ever get resolved.

I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.


Thanks, Jane

I wanted to ask a favor.  Would you mind reminding your group to please let 
us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal 
in sitara.  If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the 
deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically 
update when you change the physical deal.  If the change is simply a meter, 
that will not effect the pricing of the deal.  Thanks for your help.

It was great to hear from you.  Things are going well for me at Enron. I am 
on the trading floor working with the natural gas traders.  The work is fast 
paced and very educational.  

How is your family doing?  I hope it is still expanding with recent grand 
children.

I was sorry to hear of your leaving NSF.  They are definitely going to miss 
your expertise and committment.  I am sure however, that you are exciting 
about the "time off".  

Please stay in touch and if you are ever passing through Houston, please look 
me up.  I look forward to talking with you soon.

Did you see the first three games of the divisional series?  4 of the 6 
starters were former Astro pitchers - within the last three years.  Halama, 
Garcia for Seattle - Randy Johnson trade, Hampton and Kyle.  How sickening is 
that.  However, McClain has said he is going to up the budget for next year 
by....1 MILLION $, yee haw.

Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our 
traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for 
the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is 
very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not 
always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning 
and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is 
very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help.

FYI, you may see some January/February OA variances on Sithe due to these 
tagg numbers.  The sitara deal number involved is 543246.  Shout with any 
questions.

Subject: Re: Sithe Independence -- 400 MW Turndown for January 2001  

Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 
Sithe's P&L.

1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this 
revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction 
in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe 
Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a 
financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's 
invoices.
3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the 
FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be 
modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial 
annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule 
B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the 
FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the 
FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).

These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish 
the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks.

Kam--

There was a typo for the gas volume that was used in Stacey's worksheet
to calculate the gas price.  The original spreadsheet had 11,240 Dth/day
and a gas price of $11.126/ Dth.  When you use the correct volume of
22,263 Dth/day, the gas price drops to $5.6172 for Day 1 in the attached
file.  This corrects the double-counting I told you about this morning. 

The spreadheets you sent to me calculate the power keep whole expense
on the "Gas Price" sheet.  On the sheet, it is the sum of $3,880,560 ( i.e. 
the correct
number if Day 31 is actualized rather than estimated by the power curves).

Unfortunately, Stacey's calculation does not include the transport commodity
savings, the tax expense and the amount of sharing due Sithe.  Those numbers
were provided in my memo on Friday.  If we do one of these deals again, we 
can provide Stacey with the additional expenses and revenues so that it can
be perfect calculation.  

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth

They are pretty well known here and are pretty expensive.  Their store is in 
a very nice area of houston.  Should be ok.

Hi Everybody,
It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching. I am
trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of
you. The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton.  The first
mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May. I am trying to verify
some address information before then.  If you could email me back with your
correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right
one) that would help.  Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High
School class of 1990 reunion web page.  You will be able to find out updates
on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information
on the website.  At least, that is the plan as of today.  If you can spread
the work about the website it would be appreciated.  The address will be
www.clhs90.com.

I will send out more information as I put it together.  If anyone needs to
get a hold of me you can reach me at this email address or my home number
(703) 532-8881.  I hope everyone is doing well and I look forward to seeing
everyone in September.  If you have additional addresses of fellow classmates
you can send me that would be very helpful.

Jennifer Kerber

I forgot to tell you last night, Ginger called and said Tori will be there.  
I thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well.  What 
about just going out to eat at Lupe's with your mom and nonnie?  That sounds 
good to me.  We do not have to have a party with Brian/Rebecca, Kim and Ev 
and then they feel obligated to bring a gift.  No big deal to me and I am 
sure no big deal to them.

What are we doing for dinner tonight?

I did get the tickets in.  Don't worry about a check, just give me the money 
in NO.  I am totally siked.  Been a long couple of weeks and looking forward 
to hitting the fest early with my road dog to play some hacky and drink some 
beer before the crowd joins us.

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=

continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=

Enron is a great place to work.

Your lucky those cans didn't explode and get all over your clothes huh?  
Thanks again, it actually tastes pretty good, but you know my criteria for 
beer - cold.

I was just giving you a hard time about the name, that is reason #4761 why it 
is good to be a man.  Ashley did the same thing with the middle name, that 
way you keep some of your family.

We finally got some cold weather here.  I know you guys just got back from a 
vacation, but were wondering if you might like to join us for a skiing trip 
to Deer Valley.  We are going Jan 6 - 13th.  The accomodations are paid for, 
you would just have lift tickets and airfare.  We are staying in a ski in and 
ski out condo, so we are going to do some grocery shopping and cook.  Jason 
Tidwell and his girlfriend are coming in on the 6th and leaving on the 9th, 
so if you want to come in half time, that is cool too.  Just let us know.  
Talk to you soon.

Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas 
cards.

How is married life treating you?  Good I hope.  What are you guys doing for 
Christmas?  Are your folks coming in?

We are staying in Houston.  Should be nice and quiet.  We are going to have a 
few people over for new year's, but nothing special.

Now it is on...bring it Bass.  The PLove is back to sew up this league like I 
am doing in football.  Come down my way and hand over my share of this week's 
pot.  I guess I will get the pool again this week since I am playing you, the 
only one with a chance to outscore me.

Phillip/Milton

Phillip, this liquidation looks like it relates to Reliant contract 813, 
Sitara deal  459075,  which was booked as a physical storage withdrawal for 
January production in the January GL.  I don't normally see liquidations for 
physical storage.  Is there anything else you can tell me about this?

Milton, can you confirm that this is really physical storage?

Thanks,
Cathy

Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday 
and the farwell deal.  Please review and let me know if you agree with this.  
If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet 
amounts.  We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange 
being included in this model.  For the foreign exchange,  I took an average 
exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.  Thanks.

You are the cedar tree and the comments pretty much all apply.  I am the elm

What tree did you fall from?  

Find your birthday, find your tree and then scroll down... This  is
really cool and somewhat accurate, also in line with Celtic astrology.  


Dec 23 to Dec 31 - Apple Tree 
Jan 01 to Jan 11 - Fir Tree  
Jan 12 to Jan 24 - Elm Tree

I have a few concerns about this.  We are suppossed to be the only point of 
contact for changes in tagg.  This is an internal control issue that leaves 
all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.  If other people are 
touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further 
and thus take longer to resolve.

I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current 
system?  Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?  If 
so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.

Please let me know if the others disagree with me.

Thanks.

To me, this looks to be a sign problem in the FRED model.  The variance in 
all cases is exactly double the flashed amount.  Jim please verify if this is

The tickets for HOB will go on sale around next wednesday.  I will call and 
get them.  I am starting to get pumped as well.  Luckily I have a trip to 
Vegas in March that will hold me over.  

I need to find my hand hacky sack so we will have a back up plan.  I have a 
couple of new chairs in a bag for us - full lounge chairs.  They even have 
beer holders in the arms.

P, we are getting close. Did the Tickets go on sale  for any of the concerts 
at the House of Blues?

We need to come up with a gimmick for the fest!  Like the Hand bean bags.

See you soon.

Hi All -

The following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) project status:

TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam, 
Phillip, Darron and Winfree have received training and Errol is scheduled for 
tomorrow (5/15).

One request that came out of training was to provide a "left column freeze" 
in order to scroll across and still maintain what row is being reviewed.  Hal 
will follow up on this request.  Please forward me any additional requests 
that may be required or suggestions you may have. 

Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history 
is being established and provide realistic information to review during UAT.  
Also, we ask that each one of you review the system as much as possible 
during the UAT review period this week to ensure the system is working 
properly and is meeting your expectations. 

Thank you for your help and support!

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

I am the last one to have a problem with people throwing balls around.  
However,  Frank Vickers had a client from another firm here today and people 
were shooting baskets while the clients were looking on.  I'm sure 
professionalism is not the first thing they thought of as they were watching 
this.  While it is important that everyone have fun,  it is more important 
that we are a seen as a professional organization.  We are on the same floor 
as the originators and therefore there will be many clients coming through 
here in the future.  It would be a shame not to get business because someone 
in our group was firing jumpers.  Thanks for your help in ensuring that this 
doesn't happen again.

touchy,touchy.  seems like the frustration of three straight top 5 recruiting 
classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you.  It will be ok.  
Hopefully Mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of 
persuasion.

I have even read where Ronney Daniels has said he does not mind having a 
reduced role as long as we win.  Hopefully the good times will continue.  I 
get all of those articles from that website  ww.tigeronline.com.  It is an 
outstanding website.  That article was from the Huntsville Times.  See you 
soon.

FYI,
I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the 
central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced 
deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came 
out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated 
the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on 
the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed 
gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 
2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's 
price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to 
give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be 
seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my 
logic, please give me a shout. Thanks.

The feeling is mutual.  Things are going good, even better if I could get out 
of here at a decent time.  At least I don't have Susan's hours.  Are you

So I hear you are stealing my man Vic's bonus check?  I am sure you didn't

We will take the variance on Central back page for approx. $791K for prior 
month book balance in 1100.  1100 was the first month that we switched the 
central transport flash from GD central to Intra Ontario so we flashed it 
incorrectly.  Thanks.

I?don't know if you've heard, but starting Jan 1,2001 you  will 
nolongerbeable  use a cell phone while driving unless you have a "hands 
free"adapter.?  I went to Circuit City and they wanted $50 for a hands 
freeadapter!!!?

Ihave managed to get hold  of some "off brand" units and was 
wonderingifanyone is interested. These kits  are compatible with any 
mobilephone  andone size fits all. I paid $8 each for  buying in quantity. 
I'msellingthemfor  $10. I tried them out on Erisson, Motorola, & Nokia phones 
andtheyworked perfectly. A photo is attached. Take a look and let me 
knowifyouwant one.

I had a little bird put a word in my ear.  Is there any possibility for Ben 
Raimer to be Bush's secretary of HHS?  Just curious about that infamous UTMB 
rumor mill.  Hope things are well, happy holidays.

The security desk, has changed TDS access approval from Bill Kasemervisz to 
each respective desk lead.  
The attached application should be saved on your C:drive and used to grant 
access to people that you want to have access to your desk.
The application is pretty self explanatory, however if you have any questions 
please give me a call.

The only thing that I can find is Sitara #575092.  This is the only August 01 
deal we have with them.  This volume and price do not match up.  Sylvia does 
not recall the deal they describe and  has no paper work for it.  ANR Lebanon 
Ohio does not sound familiar.  The only thing that I can think of is that 
they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.  If they can 
prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.  Let me 
know how I can further assist you.  Sorry.

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.

Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you.  Work has been real hectic.  
Trust me, I feel old as well.  The old body doesn't cooperate like it use 
to.  

Jackson and Ashley are doing great.  We got our tree up and he just rounds 
around pointing at the glass balls on the tree and yelling balls!!!!

This christmas should be fun.  When are you coming out here to visit?

FYI-
We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for 
physical deals.  We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production 
because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.  Usually 
these are less than .05 different.  If you have a physical mich physical it 
should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), 
if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.  Any 
questions, ask.  Thanks.

I agree with you.  We are going skiing in January.  If ya'll want to come or 
come to a football game in the fall.  I am not sure if we can make it out 
there before the end of the year.  I have spoken for all of my vacation 
days.  Did you see the sorry Astros released Cami today?  The man gave up all 
of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out 
him.  Typical Drayton McClain.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training 
plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with.  I need to 
still meet with Souad for this month and need to get with Anna and go over 
the information that I have given her.  One thing that seems to have come up 
several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions.  Some topics 
that have come up are OA and  curve mapping.  I have talked with Kam about 
this and we are going to try and put something together.

Phillip,
I spoke with someone in our technical team about the ability to provide the 
EnronOnline price reports in a downloadable format.  What I think we can do 
is send a csv file (comma separated values) to the O:\ drive everyday 
containing all of the data that appears in the EnronOnline price reports.  
Then, you could just go in and open that it in Excel or copy and paste it 
from the csv file into Excel, which is easy.  Let me know if I can explain 
this better.  As far as saving it on the O:\ drive is concerned, I am 
currently thinking that we would just create a new folder that EOL can access 
and you can access.  This way, if any other desk has a similar request to 
yours, they can just get permission to access that folder.

We are going to finalize the details, and I will let you know how long it 
will take to get this done.  The technical person who can do it is out of the 
office until Thursday, so I am assuming we won't have a good estimate until 
then.  

I will keep you posted.
Thank you.
Julie

Subject: EOL Gas Prices

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.

I do not mind us bringing JAckson.  I understand your desire to be with him 
all the time, but I would like to occasionally do something with our friends 
for a vacation that is just us.  I think in time you will become more 
comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.

You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.  If we 
go we need to make plans for barkley.

Bundle Jackson up this morning it is near freezing.  Please cover the plants 
out back.  Thanks.

I will leave steve's situation for him to describe.  Needless to say as far 
as I am concerned he wasn't leaving with anybody but me.  

I ran into your dad at the post office last night.  He was standing next to 
the mail slot crying.  It would be nice to live in Denver, just have to find 
a good job so that I can afford housing.

Man, I wish you could have made it to the reunion.  We had a really good time 
and it was good to see everybody.  What are you doing in Norway for a job?  I 
am still enjoying Enron.  I am headed to Auburn this weekend for our last 
home game of the season.  Should be fun.  If we make it over to Europe any 
time soon, we will look you up.  We will probably wait until Jackson is a 
little older so that he will enjoy it more.  How is your Pop doing?  I bet he 
hates having you so far away.  Did you purchase a new bronco when you got to 
Europe or have the old one shipped over?  Boy did we cruise in that thing.  
Stay in touch.

This is Mike Wolfe's son.  He graduates this semester from Texas Tech and is
moving back here to help his father since his mother passed away a few
months ago.  Kevin says he is a good kid and very smart.  Could you give it
Ashley or someone else at Enron.

Subject: Trading Track Information

As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading 
track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their 
respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each 
rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to 
present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or 
someone in your group).  

For example:
What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible 
for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of 
positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the 
floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the 
time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are 
given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato 
and Dave Delaney.

The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:
 where to sit
 User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system, 
intercom, etc.)
 How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.
 Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and 
preferably by 7:30

It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the 
participants on their first day:
 able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and 
answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and 
understand the information that you are giving.
 ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are 
faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick 
decisions and understand which is the most important.
 meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders 
must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.
 Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the 
numbers that you provide to the floor.
 Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and 
expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is 
understandable.
 Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.
 Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of 
the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not 
acceptable.
 Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and 
downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.
 Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the 
job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.
 Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory
 Excellent analytical skills - same
 Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the 
information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts 
what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more 
or better information.
 Effective time management -  self explainatory
 Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important 
that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make 
the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.
 Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions 
and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals 
come from this system.
 Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty 
risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what 
the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.
 Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to 
understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to 
understand proper hedging strategies etc.

Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of 
each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations 
while in your area.

Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing 
in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.

Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in 
your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc)
I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training 
before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of 
understanding of positions and value at risk.

Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into 
some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of 
rotations.

The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.  

Thank you very much for you time and consideration.

Send those dirty jokes to my home email - plove570@cs.com.  They are pretty

Jim,  Were you able to locate this liquidation for April.  I realize it has 
been booked in TAGG between FT books, however, can you somehow get the value 
in  IM Ontario?  Let me know if I can provide you with any additional 
information that will help resolve this issue.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

Attached is the updated spreadsheet, which provides the additional 
information that you requested.  The Region Code for each book and your 
previous evaluation of the book status' have been included.  I hope this will 
help your group more easily identify which books are theirs.  As you are 
aware, Sally considers this a high priority project.  I would appreciate it 
if you could return this spreadsheet to me by Wednesday, the 14th.  

Please refer to the previous memo about the rules for each field that needs 
to be updated.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33102.

Thanks for your help on this.

I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any 
way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?  Since 
we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?  I know 
there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?  Wasn't 
really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her 
grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.  
Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon.

As Marina and I discussed this morning, accounting requests that we 
officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them 
to run reports.  We do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons: 
1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are 
captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).  If we were to officialize 
these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing 
half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.  2) 
All of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third 
parties.  

To keep this action from disrupting your group, the risk leads will forward 
an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request.  
The following is the list Rachel Crowell in Acctg. asked us to officialize on 
3/12/01:
1054100
1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689
1055194
1055195
1055196

Please shout with any questions, thanks.

Glad to hear your trip was wonderful.  Things are great hear.  We are 
anxiously awaiting the arrival of football season and our annual trips back 
to Auburn.  Where is Steve's new job?  Are you guys still planning on going 
to the Friday night party at Cadillac Bar.  I have to hurry and send in my 
money for the event.  Talk to you soon.

Jim, would you mind setting up a meeting with the appropriate people so that 
we can get this resolved, I was assured by Misti Day the first week of 
December that this would be fixed.  Thanks for your help.

There were two negative originations in the central gas daily book.  One in 
August for $489,600 and one in Sept for $258,000.  The GDCentral book got the 
credit/income for these through our top level origination entries.  

Thanks,

Are you aware that the Central desk is expecting negative originations for 
July through September to cover demand reimbursement on Natural Gas Pipeline 
for July through September?

Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of 
SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.  
Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.

Jim

It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative 
originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July 
through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are 
you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance?

Thanks,
Cathy

I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This 
relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics 
yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.  
This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous 
deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears 
you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are 
E00982.4 &.5.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain 
in the butt.

Thanks.  I think we have everything covered.  We are taking Jackson, I 
believe everyone else is leaving their kids at home.  If you guys want to 
bring Drew, we have no problem with that, there however won't be any other 
kids his age to play with.  Talk to you next week.

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

We have received the April Liquidation file from portfolio accounting.  We 
are now up to 89%(Tagg deals containing Sitara #'s) with only a small handful 
containing Sitara #'s that are invalid(13).  Thanks for the work that you and 
your groups have done to make it easier to match up deals on the back end of 
the process.  Again, thank you.

It is an absolutely hilarious video of a pakistani man firing a shotgun in a 
range and the gun shooting out of his hand and him yelling at his friends.  
Real player should be able to play it - that is what I used.  

I had a good time.  Send me those pics.  It was great seeing everybody and 
give us a shout the next time you are in town.

0011 Lone liquidation variances:
CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in 
forms and we should have used these to clear.
ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.  The gas 
that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern 
Natural.  This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements. 
Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara 
#456560, again, no variance to the desk.
Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to 
the desk.

Let me know if you need further info on this category.

A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.  I then went around to 
everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in 
everyone's pocket.  If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince 
them, let me know.  By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?  DO 
I have to wait until the end of the season.

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.

Just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in 
Houston inactivate the spot contract we have with Sunoco Inc so that anyone 
that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place 
or get this one reactivated.  This difficulty should send up a red flag and 
keep deals from flowing with this counterparty.  Please let me know if you 
need any further information.  Thanks.

Hi guys,

Because of the EOL group putting in language to automatically flip deals to 
the P& book as soon as they are booked, the number of deals to be flipped at 
the end of the month has decreased quite a lot, but there are always some 
stragglers that are left behind.  Here is what I've come across.  Could you 
please flip these deals before the end of the week.

FT-EAST



FT-ONTARIO



G-DAILY-EST



GD-CENTRAL



As far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.  
I've gone through all the other books that I could
think of, but I might have missed some.  Could you please make sure that I'm 
not missing any deals.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know 
when these have been flipped.

Thanks for all your help again.

Stacey

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to

Bill:

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

Subject: Re: TDS Position Flag  

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

He led the nation last year -JUCO- in rushing and touchdowns and was JUCO 
player of the year.  He went to Butler JUCO and led them to a national 
championship.  In the national championship game, he had 300 yards and 7 
touchdowns.  He has 3 touchdowns so far this year over 70 yards.  He is a 
welcome addition to our poor running game.
