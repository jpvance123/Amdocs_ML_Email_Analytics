A couple of months ago, we formed a new group within EPSA called the 
Regulatory Affairs, Washington Staff, group (the name needs some help).  We 
discussed many things the group can do to increase our EPSA presence at FERC, 
including establishing monthly lunches featuring a different FERC 
guest/speaker per lunch.

Yesterday, Donna and I attended the first lunch of the group, sponsored by 
Mirant (Enron will be sponsoring the July lunch).  The FERC guest speaker was 
Don Gelinas.  (We believe Don had a big part in the Entergy Source & Sink 
order, so he is an important person to know.)  There were about 12 people at 
the lunch, which was a good number because it gave us all a chance to speak 
with Don and get to know him a little better.  The group was relaxed and 
festive, and I think this put Don at ease as well.

Don made a few remarks at the end of the lunch.  He said the Commission's 
main focus (other than California) was on the RTOs and getting them up and 
running by the end of the year.  He said FERC's main concerns are on:  
1)independence, 2) appropriate incentives, and 3) appropriate scope.  

Don acknowledged that having sufficient scope is a problem with a voluntary 
program, but he believes the Commission, under Hebert's leadership, will be 
able to gradually expand the scope of the RTOs so that ultimately there are 
only a handful of RTOs in the country.  Furthermore, Don said there are 
certain issues he believes must be included in RTO filings, including putting 
native load under the RTO tariff.   However, he says that phase-in may be 
necessary, and the trick will be in finding a reasonable phase-in period.

Other issues that Don said may require actual FERC decisions (FERC calling 
balls and strikes) will be on issues such as ATC, CBM and curtailment.  Don 
said ATC should be calculated the same way by all RTOs and that the question 
of retaining CBM must be decided by FERC.  

Based on these comments, these three areas may be places where we could get 
some FERC support for our views.  We should keep this in mind as we comment 
on future RTO filings.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah and Donna

Subject: Ken Lay Mention At NRSC Reception Last Night

Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's 
reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.  (Frist is the NRSC chairman this 
cycle.)  Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, 
the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the 
NRSC's National Finance Chairman.  Present were over a dozen Republican 
senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond 
(MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI).

The "news" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for 
praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their 
new "Majority Makers" program.  This is the effort that Barbour will head up 
to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events 
outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC 
presence.  Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston 
fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total.  Ken was the 
first name he mentioned.  The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan 
and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC.

Needless to say, I was suddenly quite "popular" after Haley made his remarks 
to the assembled group.  Haley said he looked forward to working with us on 
this project.

As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our 
mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told 
Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the 
first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the 
effort.  While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the 
event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an 
educated assumption on my part).

Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was 
present when Haley made his comments.

Unlike the past Administration where Secretary Richardson served as the lead 
on energy policy, the Bush Administration has created a new, interagency 
group to develop energy policy.  "The National Energy Policy Development 
Group"  was created for this purpose and will be lead by Vice President 
Cheney with former Senate Energy Committee Staff Director Andrew Lundquist 
serving as the group's director.  As such, rather than focusing our policy 
meetings at DOE, we should refocus instead on developing policy with this 
group which includes DOE, DOA, DOI, Treasury, etc.  Brian Malnak is the new 
Senate Energy Committee Staff Director.

WASHINGTON -- Greg Simon, who spearheaded the cable open-access effort for 
America Online Inc. after leaving the Clinton White House, has signed up to 
lobby for Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trading company with close 
political ties to the Bush Administration. 
Simon -- a top media and telecommunications adviser to former Vice President 
Al Gore and founder of his own lobbying firm, called Simon Strategies -- 
filed a lobbying-registration form with the clerk of the House of 
Representatives on June 18. He also registered Simon Strategies assistants 
Kristan Van Hook and Ann Morton as Enron lobbyists. 
On the form, Simon said he planned to lobby the White House, Congress, the 
Commerce Department and the Federal Communications Commission "in furtherance 
of national policies that support competitive access by content providers to 
broadband communications networks." 
Simon declined to discuss his Enron duties, except to say  he was lobbing for 
the company directly, indicating that Enron was not joining Simon's OpenNet 
coalition -- the group once funded by AOL to pressure the FCC and Congress to 
impose open Internet access mandates on the cable industry. 
"I am not registered to do [Enron's] press for them," Simon said in a phone 
interview. "You have to talk to them about what they want to say to the 
press. That's not what they want me to do unless they give me the go-ahead to 
do that." 
Enron is a $100 billion energy company with a broadband-services division. 
The company signed a video-on-demand deal with Blockbuster Inc., which 
collapsed in March with each side blaming the other for the venture's 
failure. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay is a longtime informal adviser to President Bush 
on energy issues. He was one of 212 individuals who each raised $100,000 for 
the Bush campaign, while Enron provided corporate jets for Bush campaign 
officials, according to U.S. News and World Report. 
Wendy L. Gramm, wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), is an Enron board 
director, according to Enron's company Web site. 
U.S. News also reported that Enron employees gave $1.3 million to the GOP 
last year. It also stated that three Bush administration officials -- senior 
adviser Karl Rove, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff I. Lewis Libby, and 
top economic policy adviser Lawrence Lindsey - each owned at least $50,000 in 
Enron stock, though Rove has moved to sell the shares. 
Sources said Simon is planning to revive the open-access issue on behalf of 
Enron and The Walt Disney Co. and perhaps expand the effort to include 
nondiscrimination by cable operators against unaffiliated 
interactive-television providers. Enron did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. 
A Disney official has repeatedly said that the company has made no decision 
about joining any open-access or ITV coalition. 
A source who recently met with Simon said the lobbyist indicated his Enron 
job would deal with open access to cable facilities. 
"What he said suggested to me that he has had conversations with [Enron and 
Disney], and it does seem that those companies have something in common on 
open access," the sources said. 
Another source said Enron, which owns an 18,000-mile global fiber-optic 
network, was looking to deliver content from that plant to end users over the 
last mile controlled by cable and phone companies. 
"Their interest is, essentially, access to the local loop," the source said. 
Cable industry sources said they were puzzled by Simon's latest move and 
didn't have a clear sense of where he would begin to apply pressure.
One cable industry wag quipped, "Enron is a major content provider of oil, 
gas and electricity." 
All Simon would say is that he is "representing Enron Broadband directly. 
Anything more, you have to talk to Enron about. I make it a habit not to put 
words in my client's mouth."

Subject: Duty Calls

It is with mixed emotions that I must announce that I will be leaving
Calpine effective Friday, June 8th.  I have been asked by the Bush
Administration to go back and serve again.

In my new life, beginning on June 11th, I will be the Senior Electric
Policy Advisor to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.  In this role I will be
responsible for helping craft the Administration's electric
restructuring bill, evaluate the feasibility of a national electric grid,
help advise the administration on the steps necessary to help solve our
western electric crisis, work with Congress, and help craft many other 
policies that will
positively impact the competitive electric industry.  This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity that I felt I could not pass up.

I do not yet have a new email but will forward it when I get it.

My new phone number is 202-586-7131 (after June 11th).

Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, 
Joshua Sheinkman.

As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of 
operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more 
details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of 
financial information.
The additional details they are looking for include: what information should 
be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made 
available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested 
that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, 
whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned 
utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this 
happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending 
FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the 
legislation.
Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and 
forward to Linda. Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some 
legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at 
joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov.
Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the 
legislation.  (Linda)
It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to 
use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible 
for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction. (Linda and Joe)

This is an update of the Email below.  With respect to DOE efforts to draft 
electricity legislation, a list of potential items for the bill are being 
discussed this afternoon with Secretary Abraham.  DOE hopes to have a draft 
bill submitted to the White House by Friday, June 15, for consideration by 
the VP Task Force.   Similar to efforts other private sector parties are 
undoubtedly taking, I would like to submit to DOE our suggestions for the 
legislation.  As mentioned below, this bill will not include open access, but 
there are issues related to access which we may want to submit to DOE such as 
how to deal with non-jurisdictional entities.  Other topics on which we may 
want to submit legislative language are PUHCA (the reporting requirements), 
interconnection, reliability, negawatts, RTO ownership issues, and eminent 
domain.  DOE seem very willing to deal with the non-jurisdictional entities, 
either in the rulemaking context or by legislation.  Tom Briggs will be 
following up with appropriate folks on this project.   If you have any other 
ideas for this effort, please let us know ASAP.

(Please do not circulate or discuss the information on this Email outside the 
parties listed here.)

Debate within the Administration on implementation of its energy plan appears 
to be settled.  This debate was prolonged because of change in control of the 
Senate.  The Administration has decided to transmit to Congress by mid-June a 
comprehensive letter containing an inventory of energy plan recommendations 
requiring legislative action.  I understand that legislative language will 
not be transmitted in connection with this letter.  Soon after receipt of the 
letter, the President will host a meeting at the White House of bipartisan 
congressional leaders and some key committee chairs and ranking Members.  The 
purpose of the meeting will be to convey to Congress the imperative of acting 
quickly on the President's plan and it will serve as an official launch of 
the legislative effort and the Administration's efforts to work with Congress 
on the plan.

In the meantime, the Departments and Agencies are already drafting parts of 
the energy plan.  For example, we have been told by DOE that they are 
presently drafting an electric restructuring bill.   I have calls into DOE to 
find out more about their efforts and the specific provisions to be included 
in such legislation.  We have learned that "open access" will not be in this 
legislation, as the President's report instructs FERC to undertake the 
project.  Thus, the Administration continues to believe that legislation is 
not needed for the core open access provisions and that this is a matter they 
understand will be at the top of Pat Wood's agenda.  Among other items, one 
question we will probe with DOE is whether the electricity legislation will 
contain access provisions pertaining to entities presently outside FERC's 
jurisdiction.  

At present, it does not appear that the various provisions being drafted by 
the agencies will be bundled into single transmission from the Administration 
to the Hill.  Instead, the VP's task force intends to have these legislative 
drafts ready to provide relevant committees at the appropriate time.  This 
part of the implementation plan, of course, could change.

As for Pat Wood, we continue to receive confirmation from Hill and Executive 
Branch sources that the White House intends to designate Mr. Wood as FERC 
Chair.   Timing of the switch remains unclear.  Our latest information 
suggests it could be September 1.  Many parties are suggesting to the White 
House that the change should take place earlier than that date.  

We have efforts underway to structure our position on a possible open access 
rulemaking.  A few folks on this email will be talking with Dan Watkiss today 
about such a proposal.

As part of its implementation of the National Energy Policy (NEP) issued last 
week, the Administration today published two two executive orders in the 
Federal Register.  The first order, No. 13211, requires that agencies prepare 
a Statement of Energy Effects when an agency undertakes actions that are 
likely to have a significant effect upon the supply, transmission, or use of 
energy. The Statement of Energy Effects is designed  to provide useful energy 
related information and allow for better decision-making.  The second order, 
No.13212, encourages agencies to expedite their review and approval of new 
energy projects.

Vince,

Thanks for your comments. I will adapt the memo to our clients to make it
more neutral.

I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one of my
associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended. He is now
working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on Friday.

He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did not have
enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might turn
into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite different in
its structural aspects).

Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can call DC
any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have someone like
me as a side channel.

If I can be useful in this channel let me know.

All the best.

Ed

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks

The Senate Energy Committee held an oversight hearing today on siting 
impediments to energy infrastructure.  The four witnesses were Jerry 
Halvorsen of INGAA, William Nugent of Maine for NARUC, David Cook, general 
counsel of NERC, and Stan Szwed, vp-transmission of FirstEnergy Corp.  The 
hearing was well attended by committee Republicans, but only Sen. Bingaman 
and Sen. Landrieu on the Democratic side, and then only briefly.

Highlights

NARUC's Nugent urged the Committee to move swiftly to confirm Wood and 
Brownell to FERC, noting their confirmation hearing is tomorrow.

Consensus that energy infrastructure is not able to keep up with projected 
energy demand, both gas and electric.

Surprising willingness (even among western Republican senators who are 
normally pro-states rights, pro-private property rights) that Congress should 
at least seriously consider, if not implement, some form of federal authority 
over power transmission siting.  Specifics were not nailed down, with some 
senators expressing more support for treating electric like FERC already has 
power over natural gas, while others were inclined more toward a FERC back 
stop or last resort authority when state decisionmaking breaks down.  The 
drift was certainly toward some enhanced federal role.

NERC released is Summer Assessment today that is more pessimistic than 
California ISO on the extent of expected rolling blackouts and shortages this 
summer.  NERC seees a capacity shortage in the Pacific Northwest this 
winter.  While NY/NE is adequate this summer, Cook says it bears watching 
because of bouts of high heat in the region and a high level of unplanned 
outages that often occur in the region in the summer.

Chairman Murkowski engaged in a series of questions with INGAA's Halvorsen 
designed to lay the blame for the natural gas capacity problem to California 
and corresponding high price levels on the actions of LDCs in California not 
supporting expansion of interstate pipelines.  Halvorsen's testimony includes 
a chart of specific cases where LDCs intervened.  In his verbal testimony, 
Halvorsen singled out Sempra as a source of opposition, including Sempra 
filings against expansions by Transwestern and Kern River.

Chairman Murkowski got Halvorsen to say that the actions of the California 
LDCs and the intrastate nature of all gas pipelines in California effectively 
denied California consumers the benefit of open access for natural gas.  
Murkowski implied he would entertain a change in the Natural Gas Act as it 
relates to the status of interstate pipelines going in to California.

Sen. Domenici joined the increasing chorus of members of Congress raising 
questions about why natural gas prices are low at the wellhead for his 
producers in New Mexico, but so high into California.  He asked the panel who 
is making the money in the differential, but none of the witnesses wanted to 
tackle the question.  This is just one more indication of the growing 
interest in the natural gas aspects of the California situation.

Rick, I am attaching a bio on Glen.  He is Trent Lott and Thad
Cochrans appointee and has done a great job at TVA.  TVA is now
without a chairman.  It is my opinion that things will move much
slower if President Bush does not appoint a chairman.  Mcculough
is the right person.  He has told me that if the president wants
to put another person as chairman after he or she is cleared
through the process then he will step down.  This process will
take six month or more.  I am told that there might have been an
offer for acting Chairman, but this would not be a good idea.  I
would appreciate any help.  Please keep me informed.  Johnny

I have attached a proposal prepared by Reliant.  Reliant hopes that it is 
something that Enron can support (with any modifications).  Steve Walton has 
concerns about the role of the WSCC.  ELCON supports the concept with some 
other modifications.  I recognise that there are issues. Nonetheless, to 
respond to Barton's short term emergency measures, it would be usefule to 
know whther a negawatt program across the WSCC can be im[plemented by June.

Rick and Jim:

As Linda and I discussed with Rick, attached are two memos which lay out the 
plan we discussed last week in Washington in how to restructure the 
Washington office.  The first memo is a narrative summary, and the second is 
more of an outline of the questions we addressed during our meeting last week.

I am still working on the last document which compares all of the legal work 
performed by Bracewell during the year 2000, and the work that we could 
perform in house if we are properly set up.

Let us know if you have any questions.  We look forward to talking with you 
about this.

Sarah and Linda

Yes.  We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results.  We talked 
about integrating our offices fully.  We agreed that I would put together an 
office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our 
section of the office.  This will allow  us to more fully integrate our 
activities on a daily if not hourly means.  We also talked about how John and 
Tom should think about our involvement on international issues.  Our basic 
framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings 
activities into John's  and Tom's portfolios.  By that I see John handling 
project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international 
legislative issues.  There will of course be overlap but I think the friction 
we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach.  
Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's 
domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much.  
This too should lessen friction.  John and I also talked about consolidating 
our budgets.  I explained to him how that has worked to date with Joe 
Hartsoe's group.  John and I also discussed our outside counsel in the 
international arena, including McLarty.  John thought Mac could be very 
helpful to us and that we can better focus Mac's assignments.   We also 
discussed that I planned to end or multilaterize the Hills Co. engagement at 
the end of March.  I am prepared to recommend that we either terminate the 
engagement or ask other members of the coaltion to pay an equal share of the 
cost, thus potentially our cost to a $2/3K level per month from its current 
level of $20K.  I doubt members will be willing to give up their free ride, 
so my guess is that we will be terminating the contract.

Ginger --

I checked with Helen Rizzo this morning and she said there has been no final 
word about their status.
I would suggest that Rick and/or other principals discuss and get back to 
John Hardy -- when and if they make a decision
about incorporating that group into Federal Government Affairs.

That's all I know!

Best.
