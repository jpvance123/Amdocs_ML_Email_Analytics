Attached is the final version of the Charter Review for our meeting with Skilling tomorrow.  I intended to get this out sooner, but preparations for our energy tech conference tomorrow kept me fairly occupied this afternoon.

I need to go through one last time with my calculator, but do not anticipate there will be any additional revisions.  I need to speak at the conference from 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. tomorrow and will come directly to the 33rd floor thereafter.  I believe we meet at 9:45 a.m. with Skilling.

If you need to reach me this evening, my cell number is (713) 854 5232.

Regards,

MLM

Because the original DASH was based upon a $10 million (gross) sale price in a deal that fell apart, RAC is requiring another DASH since the sale to SCF will be for $9 million gross.  The delta net to ENA is negative $.5 million. 

DASH will be coming to you today.  We are set to sign final documents tomorrow.  Thanks.  Dick.

Louise:  I spoke with Rick Buy yesterday about improving our monitoring controls over potential assets that we might own due to some residual claim or "clawback" that Enron retained when the primary asset was disposed, i.e. Midwest Gas Storage.  While we don't have hundreds of these situations, I am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties, exploration options, calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off, etc.  Hopefully, most of these have been captured in our Compliance System but as illustrated with Midwest, our system does not appear airtight.

Therefore, I propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any "hidden" assets or claims that have not been properly captured.  Additionally, we will shore up our  monitoring procedures where necessary.  One of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of Senior Management with a list and description of potential assets.

In addition to RAC, I would like to have participation from the Commercial and Legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps Dick Lydecker's group would have the appropriate resources.

I would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience.    Regards,         Rick C.

We have an agreement in principle for a resolution of our investment entanglement at Canfibre Riverside and Canfibre Lackawanna:

	There will be no draw on the $4.5 million Enron obligation to fund Lackawanna based upon acceptance tests.
	Any such funding would have benefited only the senior lenders at this facility (of which we are not one).

	There will be complete release of Enron and subsidiaries for any claims, including underwriters' liability relating
	to Enron's promotion and sale of the Lackawanna bonds.  This release will cover any current or past contracts
	or agreements at any time related to our investment and ownership.  It does not include potential claims on the
	power contract at Riverside that was terminated when that company went into bankruptcy.  This contract could
	not be included since all the unsecured creditors at Riverside are stakeholders.
	
	Enron will receive $250K in cash.

In return:

	Enron will assign the Canfibre loans and the stock of the Canfibre group to the senior bondholders.

Enron's investment in the loans and stock included in this deal were written-off totally last year.  We were facing an additional potential write-off of $4.5 million this year relating to the Lackawanna additional funding.  In addition to the $4.8 million hard-dollar recovery, this transaction avoids a very real, substantial potential liability due to Enron's heavy involvement (and specific underwriting of Lackawanna) in the two Canfibre deals in which well in excess of $200 million investment (over $150 million of which came from third parties) was lost in two catastrophic financial disasters.  Richard Sanders has confirmed that getting rid of any claim on underwriters' liability has significant value in this situation.  We avoid continuing to incur substantial legal and professional expenses over a prolonged period.  We terminate significant commercial and legal time and effort that is much more productively reassigned elsewhere.

If the deal is closed, I view this resolution as a grandslam home run in the bottom of the ninth.  Through a barrage of analyses and negotiation, John Enerson managed to create some leverage where none existed that eventually forced the Canfibre bondholders into finally recognising that we were more than ready to fight them aggressively on every issue by all means available and bring them to the table.  In the end we got virtually everything we could possibly have obtained under any reasonable scenario.  John has handled this deal with creativity and persistence and deserves credit for orchestrating a very sensitive situation.  Wayne Mays from Technical Services provided key engineering support.

The documentation and closing of this transaction is scheduled to occur early next week.  Normally I would wait for closing to report success.  Since this deal was put together very rapidly, however, I wanted time to clarify any questions that might arise prior to final execution.  Of course, given that the status is agreement in principle, there is always the chance (we believe it is highly unlikely) that the deal could fall apart.

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

Today we negotiated a handshake agreement with Smith Properties to buy out JEDI's position in Inland for $2 million ($1 million net to Enron).  The DASH minimum was $1.25 million ($612,500 net to Enron), the original offer.  Documentation will be simple:  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it.  Expect to close and fund next week.

Given the Inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred, I view this outcome as very favorable.

Brandi Morris' work on this transaction was outstanding.

I had a meeting this morning with Dick to go through the assets following a discussions with the Enron Americas team.  Enron Americas will be keeping the following assets:

Bridgeline - Mrha
LRC (Enron I Cavern - to Bridgeline) - Mrha
MEGS - this asset has been transferred to ECR within Enron Americas
Onondaga - to be retained by Ben Jacoby

This solves one of the issues below.

John, Wes and Michael,

The purpose of tomorrow's meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group.  The specific issues are as follows:

?	Encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $3 million to $9.85 million in Q4 2000 without justification.  It should be written back down at the end of this quarter.  Otherwise, we are going to have a bigger problem later.
?	Dais Analytic - same issue as above.  Investment was written up from $8 million to $20 million.  It should be written back down this quarter.
?	AMPS - This is a problem.  This company is going to continue to need capital (an additional $7 million immediately) well beyond what Enron should be funding.  I am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation.  If it is that important to the strategic effort of ENA, then I recommend that ENA continue to manage the company and provide financing.
?	Bridgeline - After further evaluation, it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group.  I spoke with Jeff Donahue, and we both agree that if you want it sold, then his team should be the right one to do it.
?	Copel - This one is fuzzy, but Jeff Donahue and I have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment.  We still need to figure this one out.

Hanover's stock price closed at $35.26 today.  As recently as March 5 it was at $40.50.  Pricing for the secondary offering this afternoon was set at $35.15.  Net of the 4% spread, sellers receive $33.74 per share.  JEDI's net proceeds on 1,173,344 shares sold is $41.2 million (ENA 60% share is $24.7 million).

Although ENA's Hanover position is hedged in raptor, the put price of the costless collar is $34.875.  The unhedged loss is $800 thousand.

JEDI's share of the overallotment is 289,500.  The full overallotment was allocated.  Whether the underwriters' exercise their option is dependent on stock performance for the 30-day option period.

JEDI's remaining 4.3 million Hanover shares are subject to a 120-day lockup.

Was the Internal Ownership Policy attachment omitted from this e-mail?  It seems to deal only with capital charge although the Internal Ownership Policy is referenced in paragraph 2.

Subject:	Capital Book

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Wes,
I spoke with LJM's counsel regarding the Hanover derivatives, and we are in agreement with Enron's view regarding the settlement of the swap and the collar.  That is, the put can be exercised for intrinsic, not extrinsic, value in the interim before maturity.  Sorry it took so long to resolve this matter.

Andy

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.

Re our meeting yesteday and discussion concerning Energy Capital Resources.  You are entirely correct that, from a management control standpoint, any investment whose performance falls well short of its approved projected financial profile should be considered for transfer into a "special" or "management scrutiny" portfolio.  The only issue, then, is whether the charter of Energy Capital is an exception to that general control principle.  

Secondly, with respect to expedited DASH processing.  I met with Dave Gorte this morning to discuss some suggestions I had made, including going to an electronic approval system.  Apparently he and Rick Buy would be in favor but Jeff Skilling insists on a paper signature rather than electronic.  What RAC is going to do to begin, however, is a system of electronic DASH circulation including a signature page which could be printed out, signed, and then collected for the paper trail that Jeff requires.  I think this could significantly improve the process although it still does not address the issue of approvers who are unwilling to delegate responsibility when they are unavailable or approvers who insist on seeing other signatures before they will sign.  I also believe there could be other DASH issues beyond process, but that is a much broader question.

Louise:  I agree with your assessment that this project will essentially be managing the legal risk that accompanies these residual interests.  Since 99% of these interests resulted from deal guys trying to salvage value from troubled assets that never paid out, I initially thought that Lydecker's assessment of any potential value would be helpful.  As you point out, however,  this is Step 2 of the process with Step 1 being compilation of the list which my group can handle alone.  I will let you know when we get the list together.  Thanks for your input!    Rick C.

I don't quite understand the need for Dick's group -  all we need now is a complete list of everything and then we can decide what to do with it.  There will be items which fall under many different groups.  These are assets which are probably best managed from a legal perspective as essentially all we are managing is the ongoing legal risk.

I really forsee getting the list and making Mark Haedicke responsible for them on a long term basis.  

Tried to call you to discuss.  Let's talk later - of course you can use Dick's group if you think appropriate - I just think this is probably a legal risk issue.

Subject:	Additional Controls - Residual Assets

Louise:  I spoke with Rick Buy yesterday about improving our monitoring controls over potential assets that we might own due to some residual claim or "clawback" that Enron retained when the primary asset was disposed, i.e. Midwest Gas Storage.  While we don't have hundreds of these situations, I am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties, exploration options, calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off, etc.  Hopefully, most of these have been captured in our Compliance System but as illustrated with Midwest, our system does not appear airtight.

Therefore, I propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any "hidden" assets or claims that have not been properly captured.  Additionally, we will shore up our  monitoring procedures where necessary.  One of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of Senior Management with a list and description of potential assets.

In addition to RAC, I would like to have participation from the Commercial and Legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps Dick Lydecker's group would have the appropriate resources.

I would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience.    Regards,         Rick C.

I have suggested a slightly edited version of the draft policy.   I think classifying assets qualifying for transfer as "Problem" and/or "Orphan" may clarify the criteria.  Also, I am assuming that the intent is to except Energy Capital Resources assets from the policy and have so indicated.  On the other hand, as written, the policy would apply to Principal Investing assets.

We executed final documentation on sale of the Noram rig for $9 million ($4.4 million net to Enron).  Although the purchaser has until April 13th to fund, there are no contingencies in the contract and SCF Partners controls the entity.  The delay in funding is required since there is a 21-day period for them to make their capital calls.

A number of things came together for us this week, which is good.

The week is now over.

Today we negotiated a handshake agreement with Smith Properties to buy out JEDI's position in Inland for $2 million ($1 million net to Enron).  The DASH minimum was $1.25 million ($612,500 net to Enron), the original offer.  Documentation will be simple:  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it.  Expect to close and fund next week.

Given the Inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred, I view this outcome as very favorable.

Brandi Morris' work on this transaction was outstanding.

FYI.

Enron Principal Investments has completed the sale of Enron's ownership in COPEL.  Total proceeds for the last 5 months from this sale is over $95 million in cash. Steven Sheldon managed this process.

In the last 5 months, EPI has sold or otherwise disposed of 20 investments, with total proceeds to Enron of over $250 million in cash.

We intend to sell another 5-10 by year end, generating an additional $50 million to $100 million in cash.

The team is very focused on selling of the portfolio, creating cash and minimizing losses.

Jeff, 

The following provides background information for your call with Mel Klein at GKH (ref: the GKH memo you sent to me).  Over the past year, a number of groups/individuals have assessed the merits of acquiring GKH's interest in Hanover and all have declined due to strategic as well as financial considerations.

Please give Dick or me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Brian

To:	Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject:	Hanover GKH Merger Idea

The following is a quick review of the GKH merger analysis and the reasons we do not support it.  It is also important to keep in mind that GKH is motivated to create a short-term exit from Hanover due to the exigencies of their investment partnership expiration.  Klein's agenda is transparent.

1.	While Hanover is a well-managed, growth company, it is not a "turnaround" or "special opportunity" situation for which application of Enron's business model would promise the extraordinary returns required in order to justify an investment of $3 billion.

2.	As Enron's stock price has declined, the attractiveness of using it as a currency in any acquisition has decreased.  The PE decline also tends to make stock deals more dilutive to Enron.

3.	The GKH analysis asserts $128 million in initial year synergies and cost savings.  However, these benefits are largely predicated upon (a) use of the Enron NOL (which is an asset Enron already owns and can be applied to earnings from any acquisition)--$55 million and (b) speculative economies of scale, i.e. higher revenues and margins and significant SG & A reductions--$38 million.  

The remaining $36 million of cited benefits relates to a proposed decapitalization of Hanover from a proposed transfer of assets to a non-recourse trust (although credit enhancement and operational guarantees would be required).  Achieving these benefits would require obtaining the best possible outcome on a number of accounting, financial and credit issues.  However, even if all of these issues were resolved, the economic result is insufficient to justify the transaction.  The GKH analysis does not consider transaction, transition or capital costs.

4.	 After taking into account the capital expenditures required for Hanover to achieve its aggressive growth targets, the Company appears to be at best cash flow neutral or slightly cash flow negative for the three years presented in the GKH analysis (even including all claimed synergies and cost savings).

5.	Enron and Hanover could achieve and share many of the synergistic benefits claimed for the merger in a properly structured joint venture.  (However, this would still require finding an internal Enron "sponsor" to assume ownership of the relationship).

6.	Much of Hanover's growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally.  Given Enron's domestic opportunities, this international orientation in a non-core business is inconsistent with our present strategy.

7.	Like GKH, Enron has been a seller of our Hanover position.  An abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the Street about Enron's strategic direction.


Additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the  limitations of the GKH analysis with respect to increasing Enron's  EPS:

1.	If pooling of interest accounting is available, any acquisition Enron makes of any company that has a lower PE ratio than Enron is accretive to Enron's EPS.  There is nothing "remarkable" about this, it is simple mathematics.

2.	If purchase accounting is required, even if the entire purchase price were accounted as "goodwill" and never amortized, this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest.  However, in actuality, a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets (tangible and intangible such as contracts) which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the GKH analysis.

3.	The largest single "synergy" by far in the GKH analysis is usage of Enron's NOL to shield Hanover's taxable earnings.  Enron can obtain the benefit of its NOL by acquiring any profitable company.   GM recorded about $3.4 billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this Enron asset.

4.	The GKH analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction, i.e. the potential negative impact on Enron's own PE.

Dick

Valuations of Encorp and DAC were scheduled to be corrected in 2Q 2001.  We decided to push revaluation into 3Q in order to allow finalization of (a) repricing of Encorp and (b) completion of DAC's ongoing funding round, both of which are necessary in order to determine true fair value.  It is possible that requisite revaluations will be less than write-ups taken in 4Q 2000.

I had a meeting this morning with Dick to go through the assets following a discussions with the Enron Americas team.  Enron Americas will be keeping the following assets:

Bridgeline - Mrha
LRC (Enron I Cavern - to Bridgeline) - Mrha
MEGS - this asset has been transferred to ECR within Enron Americas
Onondaga - to be retained by Ben Jacoby

This solves one of the issues below.

Subject:	Investments Meeting Agenda

John, Wes and Michael,

The purpose of tomorrow's meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group.  The specific issues are as follows:

?	Encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $3 million to $9.85 million in Q4 2000 without justification.  It should be written back down at the end of this quarter.  Otherwise, we are going to have a bigger problem later.
?	Dais Analytic - same issue as above.  Investment was written up from $8 million to $20 million.  It should be written back down this quarter.
?	AMPS - This is a problem.  This company is going to continue to need capital (an additional $7 million immediately) well beyond what Enron should be funding.  I am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation.  If it is that important to the strategic effort of ENA, then I recommend that ENA continue to manage the company and provide financing.
?	Bridgeline - After further evaluation, it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group.  I spoke with Jeff Donahue, and we both agree that if you want it sold, then his team should be the right one to do it.
?	Copel - This one is fuzzy, but Jeff Donahue and I have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment.  We still need to figure this one out.

Louise:  Attached is an Excel file which lists the results of our search for residual assets or old assets with potential exposure. Most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by Special Assets or Energy Capital Resources.  We included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence.  However, also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to Midwest Gas Storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone's radar screen.  The scope of our review did not include any former Enron International assets now managed by Wholesale through the Global Assets group.

Our list is divided into 3 parts:  1) Retained assets, 2) Bankruptcy/ Guarantor Claims,  3) Transactions requiring legal documentation/ closure.  The Bankruptcy/Guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for Wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a  low probability of recovery which are, of course, not a high priority for Legal.  We just want to make sure they don't completely disappear from our scrutiny.  You will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination.

Finally, we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored.

Many thanks to Dick Lydecker's group and Legal for their assistance to RAC in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list.   Please call if you have questions.    Regards!     Rick C.

GKH's drag-alone rights only extend to stock actually owned by JEDI (or a subsequent purchaser in a "non exempt" transaction).  To the extent we have disposed of a part of our interest in a public sale (an exempt transaction) the rights do not attach to the shares themselves.

If JEDI sells to a third party in a non-public transaction (a "non exempt" transaction) this stock would be subject to the drag along, tag along conditions and the other provisions of the Stockholders Agreement.  There are other restrictions that restrict partial sales in a non exempt transaction to less that 50% of the original share ownership.

Enron has valued the Hanover investment at the screen price for mark to market accounting based upon the free disposition in a public transaction.  There is no question that any restriction on private sales theoretically impacts value negatively.  On the other hand, the "tag along" rights theoretically have a positive impact on value.  

In your example, if GKH sells to XYZ subsequent to completion of Enron's sale to ABC, in that case GKH could require ABC to sell to XYZ at $20.  On the other hand if GKH cuts a deal to sell to XYZ at $60, ABC would have tag along rights of inclusion at $60.

Are we saying or not then that if:

Scenario

Ene sells to ABC Inc at $40
GKH sells to XYZ Inc at $20 
XYZ has the right buy ABC's shares at $20.

If this is right are we selling our shares with this drag along right, therefore heavily discounted.

Sales under a 33 Act registration and rule 144 are "exempt transactions" per the JEDI/GKH/Hanover Stockholders Agreement.  Several months ago I confirmed with Ray Bowen that there are no other agreements that would restrict our dispositions via a public sale.

Prior to actually starting a 144 process I would advise both GKH and Hanover of our plans.

Dan, although it seems that the secondary offering lockup requirements rule out 
the type of transaction discussed this morning, the issue of other restrictions 
on JEDI right to sell was introduced.

GKH has drag-along and JEDI has tag-along rights.

There is an agreement among the Company, GKH and JEDI that restricts but does 
not preclude disposition:

 Transfers to Affiliates are OK

 A registered offering or Rule 144 disposition are OK

 Other sales involve a ROFR:

  Written notice to Company 30 days prior to proposed disposition to bona fide 
purchaser

  Company has 20 days to respond to buy all or a portion of proposed 
disposition on same terms and conditions

  If Company does not take all shares, any remaining offered to other 
shareholder within 2 days

  The other shareholder has 7 days to respond

These are the primary provisions.  We would need a more detailed assessment of 
the issue once a specific structure proposed/accepted.

Let me know if I can help.

Dick.

We have been asked to reclassify the Merchant Assets on the DPR.  Currently, these assets are shown below the total trading line of the DPR, because, as per the risk policy, they should not be considered when assessing trading activities against the trading limits.

By the end of this week, we plan to show the merchant assets P&L for each group separately under the appropriate business, and then reverse the P&L at the bottom of the DPR to arrive at total trading P&L. Currently, there are no plans to allocate Merchant Asset VAR or positions separate business units.  In order to show total Merchant Asset P&L, positions and VAR the Merchant Asset summary currently at the bottom of the DPR will be retained.

I am attaching a sample version of the changes discussed above.  Please call me at X39123 if you have any questions or concerns about these changes.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson
Director, Global Risk Operations.

I was not sure if you wanted anything in the market value columns so I have only provided book values or investment basis amounts.  We can further breakdown the HPL and LRC assets into the components that Lydecker is breaking them into by Friday.  I also provided the buy-out values for Looper and MidTexas and for your reference just to account for everything I also added Jean's balances at the bottom below the Special Assets totals.

This is more than you ever wanted to know about Catalytica!  If there is any point to regurgitating it, that point would be that this deal didn't make a dime for Enron, GE got a "gift" (as I would see it) of $10 million from Enron, and Catalytica got off scot-free.

The December 1999 DASH summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions to "permit the following:  (1) sale and repurchase of the spark spread option; (2) funding XONON development in an amount equal to the proceeds of the option sale; (3) funding the turbine prepayment at the Pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds; (4) obtaining the right of first refusal on the first five commercial 7FAs equipped with XONON; and (5) purchase of the turbines on an off=balance sheet basis"  Enhancing the value of the equity investment in Catalytica was mentioned as a strategic benefit and potential upside.  Turbine overpricing was not mentioned in the DASH or the RISK MATRIX.

When Dave added his comments to the May 2000 DASH I understood that the $10 million cost was intended to be offset by $10 million in turbine credits.  Doing an allocation of the cost seemed logically to mean allocation of the credits once they were recognised.  Outside of the slim chance that something blew up, the allocated cost would be offset with a subsequently allocated credit, i.e. a wash.

>From an ENA perspective the issue is moot.  If the decision is to allocate a portion of the turbine overpricing to the merchant portfolio but none of the credits, that clearly was not accounted for in 1999 or 2000 and certainly was not provided for in the 2001 Merchant Asset Management Plan.

Chris, thanks for the clarification.  Pat did confirm with Sheila that the turbines were overpriced...which seems to mean that Enron ended up giving GE a gift of $10 million.  That seems strange.  It also still seems to me that the December 1999 DASH did not accurately reflect the deal.  Unless I missed it, I did not find any reference to turbine overpricing.

My understanding of Dave's comment on the May 2000 DASH was to account for the acceleration period between May and September 30 and the risk that the Pastoria project would be cancelled and/or the technology development fail in that period.  In May ENA gave up the opportunity to stick Catalytica with "credits" as payment for the repurchase of the SSO rather than cash if either of these events occured before September 30 and thereby lost the optionality of the four months.  The May 2000 transaction did not change the economics of the deal in any other way than this acceleration.   If the comment was intended to allocate the turbine overpricing which was part of the 1999 original transaction, I agree with you that this should have been handled at that time.

My concern has been that Enron retain the "benefit" of the credits referenced in the XTIA which apparently has occurred.  However, the fact apparently is that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start by the turbine overpricing.

My framework had been that as long as Enron received the credits in some form, the May 2000 transaction was a wash as far as I was concerned.

Dick.

Dick,,

Sounds as though this caught you by surprise - sorry for that.  Your chronology seems correct.  This thing makes my head hurt every time it is brought up!  I believe the obligation was incurred Dec 1999, but not properly recognized/accounted for until the May,2000 DASH.  Delainey's hand-written note was the end result of people dissecting the deals with the realization that the West Power turbines were overpriced by the $9.9MM and the Catalytica equity account did not properly account for that in Dec 1999.  

The turbine contract refers to a credit of $9.9MM but the gross turbine price was increased by twice that amount so that the net increase was $9.9MM.  ENA agreed to it because Piper wanted to help Catalytica.  Despite much protest from Dave Parquet, I agreed with Delainey and Ray Bowen that West Power would be on the hook for $3.3MM of the $9.9MM because the project got some benefit from Catalytica.   Delainey wanted the payment triggered on sale of Pastoria because he did not want my group to recognize any income until the project closed.  This was communicated to and acknowledged by accounting and I reminded them of it every month or two since mid-year.    

I understand Pat called Sheila Tweed - I dont think she (or anyone) remembers the details, but she should be able to validate the point about turbine overpricing and the Delainey fix in May, 2000.  

Regards,

Chris

Subject:	Re: out of interest

Chris, I couldn't agree more about the confusing history of the Catalytica XTIA and spark spread derivative transactions.  My understanding is slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources.  Neither of us were present at the creation.

I am familiar with Dave Delainey's hand-written note on the May 22, 2000 DASH.  That DASH authorised accelerating repurchase of the SSO by three months.  My view is that Dave could allocate within ENA at his discretion.  I did not understand the rationale, however, since it was the December 14, 1999 DASH  which established the obligation for Enron to fund the $9.9 million.  All the May 22, 2000 DASH did was unwind a financing arrangement three months early.  It did not have anything to do with the incurrence of the obligation itself.

The objective of the complex series of agreements was for Enron to finance GE's development of the Xonon technology and in return receive credits on turbine purchases either at Pastoria or for other xonon-equiped turbines if Pastoria were cancelled.  

Original Deal

1.  Catalytica agreed to purchase a spark spread option (SSO) from Enron for $9.9 million payable in four instalments.  These instalments exactly matched the funding obligation to GE under the XTIA.  

2.  Catalytica actually paid Enron $3 million which represented the first two instalments.

3.  West LB made $3 million milestone payments to GE.  The Enron/West LP arrangement was an off balance sheet financing deal.  At the end of the day, Enron was paying GE.

4.  By September 30, 2000 Enron was obligated to repurchase the SSO from Catalytica for the amount Catalytica had paid Enron or for turbine credits if Pastoria were cancelled.

May 2000 SSO Repurchase

1.  Enron bought back the SSO from Catalytica for $3 million.  The three-month acceleration of repurchase was supposed to facilitate an IPO.  It did not impact at all           Enron's ultimate obligation which had always been for the full $9.9 million.

	Catalytica was now out of the chain and had no further payment obligations or credit entitlements.

December 2000 Final Milestone payment to GE

1.  Enron has paid GE $9.9 million  through the West LB financing arrangement (now Turbo Park)


I am uncertain whether GE increased the price of the Pastoria turbines by $9.9 million as part of these transactions.  My understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated, but I had thought this concern was to be guarded against in contract negotiation with GE.   If in fact GE did increase the cost of the Pastoria turbines by $9.9 million the entire purpose and benefit to Enron from these incredibly complex and non-intuitive documents was totally obviated.  Net, net Enron would have paid GE to develop a technology application with no compensatory value.  Why Enron would have done this kind of deal I don't know.

I'm not sure what internal income transfer would apply.  I understand that GE has applied the $9.9 million credit against a progress payment billing late last year.  Wouldn't this mean that the full credit was taken by Pastoria?  It is unclear to me why the sale of Pastoria should trigger anything.  

At the end of the day  ENA did the deal in 1999 and how we account for the consequences now is irrelevant.  If the turbines were overpriced, the December 14, 1999 DASH seems to me to be misleading in not disclosing that fact when approval was requested.  The DASH actually states that the $9.9 million would "serve as a down payment for the Pastoria turbine package."

My summary may not be correct but this is the best I have been able to piece together on what happened.  Dick.

Subject:	Re: out of interest   

Calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for Pastoria was overpriced by $9.9MM, the amount of the Catalytica credit.  

A brief confusing history as I understand it...ENA East and West jointly owned the Catalytica equity account in 1999.  It was written up based on expectations of an IPO value.  At 12/99 it transferred to West Power because Catalytica entered into an agreement with Pastoria to provide the Project with its Zonon technology.  This agreement included a commitment from GE to do research/work in order to use the Catalytica technology on GE turbines.  The cost of this ($9.9MM) was added to the Pastoria turbine contract.  

In Feb 2000,  when I arrived in Portland, I had the Catalytica account transferred to the Portfolio because I thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ENA West Power.  In mid-2000 the agreement was restructured in order to "clean up" Catalytica so it could IPO.  At that time, Enron was credited back the $9.9MM from Catalytica and it was decided by Delainey that that amount should be split 2/3-Pastoria and 1/3Catalytica Equity, with the 2/3 going to ENA West Power upon the sale of Pastoria.  Pastoria did not get the full $9.9MM back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings.   

At this time, since there is no funds transfer, I believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the Merchant Portfolio to ENA West Power.

what happens under the Pastoria deal to the Catalytica credit - did it go to Calpine or are you using it in the other turbine purchases?

It is a 250 ft jackup drilling rig.  It has been in storage in Galveston for two years.

Louise, the $10.9 million negative in the plan as presented to you consists of:

	Inland		$4.6 MM
	Masada	$2.9 MM
	Linder		$3.4 MM

	Total		$10.9 MM

These assets had been scheduled originally to go into raptor 2.  Without a raptor hedge, these represent the difference between estimated valuein a monetization and carrying value.

In addition to the above, the following items are incorporated into the $20.7 MM delta ENA exposure vs. base value

	Noram rig	$0.9 MM  --  The purchaser defaulted on purchase.  Our expectation for value is now lower.
	Ecogas		$2.4 MM  --   We acquired this asset after the budget.
	Canfibre LOC	$4.5 MM  --   This contingent liability may or may not be paid depending upon certain performance tests at the Lackawanna Plant
	Calpine		$2.0 MM  --  This is a drilling commitment.  I always view these on a dry hole basis.

	Total		$ 9.8 MM

I hope this clarifies the numbers.  Dick.

GKH's drag-alone rights only extend to stock actually owned by JEDI (or a subsequent purchaser in a "non exempt" transaction).  To the extent we have disposed of a part of our interest in a public sale (an exempt transaction) the rights do not attach to the shares themselves.

If JEDI sells to a third party in a non-public transaction (a "non exempt" transaction) this stock would be subject to the drag along, tag along conditions and the other provisions of the Stockholders Agreement.  There are other restrictions that restrict partial sales in a non exempt transaction to less that 50% of the original share ownership.

Enron has valued the Hanover investment at the screen price for mark to market accounting based upon the free disposition in a public transaction.  There is no question that any restriction on private sales theoretically impacts value negatively.  On the other hand, the "tag along" rights theoretically have a positive impact on value.  

In your example, if GKH sells to XYZ subsequent to completion of Enron's sale to ABC, in that case GKH could require ABC to sell to XYZ at $20.  On the other hand if GKH cuts a deal to sell to XYZ at $60, ABC would have tag along rights of inclusion at $60.

Are we saying or not then that if:

Scenario

Ene sells to ABC Inc at $40
GKH sells to XYZ Inc at $20 
XYZ has the right buy ABC's shares at $20.

If this is right are we selling our shares with this drag along right, therefore heavily discounted.

Attached is Mr. Lydecker's spreadsheet where I have added the basis for the HPL and LRC assets to be included in Special Assets plus those that will be leased or sold to AEP.  I was not sure if you wanted anything in the market value columns so I have only provided book values or investment basis amounts.  We can further breakdown the HPL and LRC assets into the components that Lydecker is breaking them into by Friday.  I also provided the buy-out values for Looper and MidTexas and for your reference just to account for everything I also added Jean's balances at the bottom below the Special Assets totals.  Call me on my cell phone if you have questions.  713-825-7240.

Subject:=09RE: Heartland Industrial Partners

With respect to your questions concerning the Heartland Industrial Partners=
 fund and current investments:

Heartland is a private equity buyout fund with $1.2 billion in commitments.=
  The targeted size of the fund is $2 billion.  The fund is headed by David=
 Stockman, former managing director at The Blackstone group.  Stockman was =
director of OMB under Reagan.

Heartland's objective is an IRR of 30% gross (26% to the limited partners).=
  The limiteds get an 8% preferred return after which the GP gets a 20% car=
ried return.  The GP also receives a 1.5% management fee.   In my experienc=
e these terms are consistent with most private equity funds.

The fund's objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies "in sect=
ors ripe for consolidation and growth."  These "industrial platform scaleup=
s" are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials=
, automotive suppliers, capital goods, chemicals, plastics conversion, meta=
l working, etc.

The fund has two investments currently:

MascoTech is a merger of three fund companies.  It is a leading global desi=
gner and supplier of high quality, low-cost metal formed components, assemb=
lies and modules for the transportation industry.  Products include noise v=
ibration and harshness products, transmission and transfer case components,=
 engine components, wheel end and suspension components, axle driveline com=
ponents.  Estimated revenues were $1.9 billion in 2001.  The company has 50=
 facilities in 11 countries.  9,500 employees.

An agreement to purchase Collins & Aikman Corporation was signed in January=
 2001.  C & A is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a l=
eading supplier of automotive fabric, interior trim and convertible top sys=
tems with 2000 sales of $1.9 billion.

The original DASH in April 2000 predicated that "ENA will receive the exclu=
sive right to provide all energy-related products and services to each plat=
form company owned by the fund...ENA will submit a comprehensive, long-term=
, energy managment plan for each platform company.  HIP will be obligated t=
o accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit=
 relative to the platform company's current practices after accounting for =
switching costs.  The expected value of this business to ENA is about $20 -=
 50 MM."

Dave,

Congrats on your new role.  Heartland Industrial Partners was an investment=
 pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourci=
ng opportunities when ENA's Industrial Group was following a broad based en=
ergy outsourcing business plan.  It has zero relevance to EIM's business.  =
In fact, Heartland has been reflected on ENA's balance sheet ever since the=
 creation of EIM last August.  Brad Dunn has administered the relationship =
as a transitional matter in the intervening months.  Brad has attempted to =
get EES to take on the transaction, but they have expressed no interest in =
the capital commitment.  However, EES wants the option to look at the energ=
y outsourcing opportunities in the transaction.  If I thought I could get a=
 free option, I would take the same position.  If Enron is to get anything =
out of Heartland Industrial Partners beyond the return on our invested doll=
ars, that value will come to EES.  Since there is no paper or steel aspect =
to Heartland, it doesn't belong in EIM and I don't want it.  I would be hap=
py to discuss.

On a different note, there are lots of opportunities for EES and EIM to wor=
k together on (i) energy opportunities in EIM's pulp & paper and steel cust=
omer base and on (ii) paper or steel opportunities in EES' client base.  Je=
remy Blachman and I had agreed on a revenue sharing plan to incent the grou=

Dave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million=
 in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.  The terms o=
f the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for=
 a limited partner such as we).  The deal was "sold" on the basis of ENA ge=
tting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies o=
wned by the fund if these were cost effective.  The claimed benefits for th=
e energy management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.  The deal was =
originated by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment h=
ad been assigned to Jim Ajello.

The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now p=
rovided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their bus=
iness plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind=
 of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment (an=
d capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the nor=
mal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership ha=
s a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest af=
ter 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair p=
rice or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except i=
n my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move t=
o EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the invest=
ment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize =
funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining commitment=
.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests, =
however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment/commit=
ment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances finding a buyer wi=
ll be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster child for "patient" =
investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is t=
hat the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed=
 the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.=

the issue once a specific structure proposed/accepted.

Let me know if I can help.

Dick.

Louise, although I am very much a supporter of the consolidation of Enron investing functions, including Special Assets, and I think the ideas Kevin Garland has expressed as objectives are excellent, I am also sorry to be leaving ENA.  I like the direction you and John have set and enjoyed working with you.  I hope to have that opportunity again.  Dick.

For several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in Special Assets to develop a fee-for-service "executive services" business.  The key idea is to participate in potentially rewarding companies and projects without commitment of Enron's investment capital.  I believe that this would be a logical extension in applying the skills and management approach we already are taking with our own portfolio.

As part of some initial feasibility evaluations, we recently have had discussions with Bill Gartland, a Houston entrepreneur, with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in Spain.  Gartland is seeking management and financial expertise to promote industrial, commercial and real estate projects in Spain.  Among other things, he presently lacks the professional skills to evaluate and package projects for presentation to sophisticated capital providers in the United States and Europe.

In addition to checking personal and business references, we had Rick Carson's group perform a due diligence review of Mr. Gartland.  His background and reputation are clean.

Through Gartland's contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Indrustriales (SEPI), the Spanish state-owned holding company for business development.  In addition, we will meet with representatives of Instituto de Fomento (INFO), the regional government of Murcia's business development group.  INFO has agreed to fund all of our incountry expenses while in Murcia on this initial visit.

In order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with SEPI, INFO and other contacts in Spain the week of June 11th.  

Unfortunately, with the tight schedule we could not arrange a general meeting to cover the concept of Enron Executive Services (EnronExec).   However, we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week's trip.

I would stress the following points:

These initial meetings are informational and relationship focused.  No commitments will be made next week.

One of the key principles of EnronExec is that we are not a source of capital.  Among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and/or project plans for presentation to capital providers.

Activities contemplated for EnronExec will complement the normal workload of Special Assets.  There will be no reduction in our efforts to achieve our primary business objectives for the team.

The expenses to evaluate the potential and, if viable, to startup the activity are modest and are consistent with our approved 2001 expense plan.

Our eventual objective to fund EnronExec is to structure cash fees at least sufficient to cover staff time and out-of-pocket costs.  We will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside.  As a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses, we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other Enron businesses.

I am very enthusiastic on EnronExec.  It appears that it may be a way to leverage Enron's unique resources and strengths into a profitable enterprise that does not require separate capital.  I would appreciate your comments and questions.

John, Wes and Michael,

The purpose of tomorrow's meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group.  The specific issues are as follows:

?	Encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $3 million to $9.85 million in Q4 2000 without justification.  It should be written back down at the end of this quarter.  Otherwise, we are going to have a bigger problem later.
?	Dais Analytic - same issue as above.  Investment was written up from $8 million to $20 million.  It should be written back down this quarter.
?	AMPS - This is a problem.  This company is going to continue to need capital (an additional $7 million immediately) well beyond what Enron should be funding.  I am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation.  If it is that important to the strategic effort of ENA, then I recommend that ENA continue to manage the company and provide financing.
?	Bridgeline - After further evaluation, it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group.  I spoke with Jeff Donahue, and we both agree that if you want it sold, then his team should be the right one to do it.
?	Copel - This one is fuzzy, but Jeff Donahue and I have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment.  We still need to figure this one out.

The biweekly April 13th report is on its way to you.  I would like to draw =
your attention to the status summaries for IHI and Canfibre.  IHI and Canfi=
bre are second to none in the portfolio as quagmires in which we have had t=
o manufacture any bit of leverage to protect Enron's interests.  These comp=
anies have been extremely uncooperative and more often than not have been w=
orking adversely to Enron.   We are in the position of playing poker with a=
bsolutely nothing whatsoever "in the hole".  Normally I try to highlight cr=
edit to the appropriate individuals in Special Assets when a transaction ac=
tually closes.  In both these cases, however, I would like to make you awar=
e that John Enerson is doing an excellent job handling the deal complexitie=
s and applying persuasion, strong-arm, threats and any and all other method=
s to optimize value.  There is not a lot of glamor working these turkeys.  =
Nothing is certain until we have cash in the bank, but I believe we may be =
seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel where there had been only ab=
yss. John deserves a great deal of credit.  Dick.

Oscar Wyatt and Tom Bachtell have agreed with our recommendation to hold off doing anything pending the results of the MCN/MCNIC arbitration scheduled July 23 - August 10.

They also were unaware that our convertible preferred was non-voting which effectively ruled out doing anything at the June shareholder meeting along the lines they were considering since the record date has passed.

Subject:	Crown Energy

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

Hey!  Hope you're doing well and getting some sleep.  John asked me to send you an e-mail concerning the move of Dick Lydecker under the Wholesale investing effort headed by Kevin Garland.  I have attached the April assets listing for your reference.  It was John's sense that he would want to place certain assets under Dick which aren't currently his, such as AIG and maybe even Bridgeline.  We should probably make some cut that could be different than the existing owners. Other  Investments of note:  Onondaga
                                All of Mike Miller's stuff( I assume including Destec)
                                Some of Redmond's retained assets (see p. 4)
                                East Coast Power loan --  $30mm 
                                All of the CLO Investments

These would all be candidates to move some of which might land with Dick anyway.  I think John just wanted you thinking about this.  Call me if you have thoughts or need further info.  By the way, I scanned other B/S accounts and nothing exists there which should be moved

Wes

Subject:=09RE: Heartland Industrial Partners

With respect to your questions concerning the Heartland Industrial Partners=
 fund and current investments:

Heartland is a private equity buyout fund with $1.2 billion in commitments.=
  The targeted size of the fund is $2 billion.  The fund is headed by David=
 Stockman, former managing director at The Blackstone group.  Stockman was =
director of OMB under Reagan.

Heartland's objective is an IRR of 30% gross (26% to the limited partners).=
  The limiteds get an 8% preferred return after which the GP gets a 20% car=
ried return.  The GP also receives a 1.5% management fee.   In my experienc=
e these terms are consistent with most private equity funds.

The fund's objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies "in sect=
ors ripe for consolidation and growth."  These "industrial platform scaleup=
s" are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials=
, automotive suppliers, capital goods, chemicals, plastics conversion, meta=
l working, etc.

The fund has two investments currently:

MascoTech is a merger of three fund companies.  It is a leading global desi=
gner and supplier of high quality, low-cost metal formed components, assemb=
lies and modules for the transportation industry.  Products include noise v=
ibration and harshness products, transmission and transfer case components,=
 engine components, wheel end and suspension components, axle driveline com=
ponents.  Estimated revenues were $1.9 billion in 2001.  The company has 50=
 facilities in 11 countries.  9,500 employees.

An agreement to purchase Collins & Aikman Corporation was signed in January=
 2001.  C & A is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a l=
eading supplier of automotive fabric, interior trim and convertible top sys=
tems with 2000 sales of $1.9 billion.

The original DASH in April 2000 predicated that "ENA will receive the exclu=
sive right to provide all energy-related products and services to each plat=
form company owned by the fund...ENA will submit a comprehensive, long-term=
, energy managment plan for each platform company.  HIP will be obligated t=
o accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit=
 relative to the platform company's current practices after accounting for =
switching costs.  The expected value of this business to ENA is about $20 -=
 50 MM."

Subject:=09RE: Heartland Industrial Partners

Dave,

Congrats on your new role.  Heartland Industrial Partners was an investment=
 pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourci=
ng opportunities when ENA's Industrial Group was following a broad based en=
ergy outsourcing business plan.  It has zero relevance to EIM's business.  =
In fact, Heartland has been reflected on ENA's balance sheet ever since the=
 creation of EIM last August.  Brad Dunn has administered the relationship =
as a transitional matter in the intervening months.  Brad has attempted to =
get EES to take on the transaction, but they have expressed no interest in =
the capital commitment.  However, EES wants the option to look at the energ=
y outsourcing opportunities in the transaction.  If I thought I could get a=
 free option, I would take the same position.  If Enron is to get anything =
out of Heartland Industrial Partners beyond the return on our invested doll=
ars, that value will come to EES.  Since there is no paper or steel aspect =
to Heartland, it doesn't belong in EIM and I don't want it.  I would be hap=
py to discuss.

On a different note, there are lots of opportunities for EES and EIM to wor=
k together on (i) energy opportunities in EIM's pulp & paper and steel cust=
omer base and on (ii) paper or steel opportunities in EES' client base.  Je=
remy Blachman and I had agreed on a revenue sharing plan to incent the grou=
ps to cooperate, but I assume you will want to understand it now.  Janet an=
d I talked about it today and she was going to follow up with Jeremy. =20

Take Care,

Ray

Dave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million=
 in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.  The terms o=
f the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for=
 a limited partner such as we).  The deal was "sold" on the basis of ENA ge=
tting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies o=
wned by the fund if these were cost effective.  The claimed benefits for th=
e energy management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.  The deal was =
originated by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment h=
ad been assigned to Jim Ajello.

The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now p=
rovided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their bus=
iness plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind=
 of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment (an=
d capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the nor=
mal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership ha=
s a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest af=
ter 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair p=
rice or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except i=
n my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move t=
o EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the invest=
ment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize =
funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining commitment=
.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests, =
however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment/commit=
ment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances finding a buyer wi=
ll be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster child for "patient" =
investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is t=
hat the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed=
 the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.=
