Ed,

I had a chance to read the contract LUS and follow-up with a phone call to 
Ron Gary to clarify.  Please note the following information:

LUS entered into a letter agreement after the contract was put in place for 
gas supply greater than Base quantities.  That price is GDA Hub + $.04.  The 
letter agreement allows LIG to 
The contract has a 75% take requirement for Base quantities but has no 
penalty if LUS does not take.  LUS uses this optionality to buy less 
expensive power in the marketplace.  There has been times that LUS takes less 
than the Base quantity.  He would be open to a GDA keep whole for this but 
would like to have 24 months of history so he can compare.  Tricia is working 
on this.  
For the Natchiotoches plant, Seller has an out if TransLa interrupts.  LUS is 
given a credit of 45,000/year for fuel retention on TransLa.  We need to 
gross up our price to account for this.
There is a GDA keep whole for any vol's that are triggered.  The trigger 
price is NYMEX plus $.04 and this basis is fixed.
LUS has not nominated Surplus volumes in two years.
Our bid will be reduced by $30,000 for the year by LUS to compare us to LIG's 
bid for gas odorization.  This will not be a cost to Enron but will be used 
in their evaluation process.
We need to state how we will make deliveries firm or why our volumes will 
flow if we do not sign up for firm capacity form the pipeline.

There is additional stuff in the contract that we need to discuss.  I'm 
working on the proposal and Hodge is working on getting a discounted firm 
rate on Texas Gas and Columbia.  Ultimately, this is what will determine if 
we win this deal or not.  Lets discuss when you get a chance.

Thanks.

Tammi,

I talked to Piedmont yesterday.  They have a bid for all of their summer 
capacity on Transco as identified in the RFP that I passed onto you at a bid 
of $.19.  How does this compare with the deal you did with CP&L?

This is what they sent..  It's a bit of a stick map, but it does what I need.

John,

I met with Ben regarding the Precedent Agreement this evening.  He had the 
following questions/comments:

1. "...Shipper's power plant construction by August 1, 2001, then either 
Party may terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing the other Party 
written notice of such termination.  ; provided that such right to terminate 
must be exercised on or before August 3, 2001.  In any event, unless the 
Shipper provides written notice to Transco on or before August 3, 2001 that 
it will enter into a Service Agreement , the Precedent Agreement will 
terminate automatically.

2. Can we make the Guaranty effective after August 3, 2001 if we do not 
terminate the Precedent Agreement?

3. In talking to Gerald Nemec, it also occurred to me that we need to 
determine any balance sheet effects of the Guaranty in relationship to this 
project.  I will check on this tomorrow and let you know.


Thanks.

     By DAVID FLESHLER Sun-Sentinel
     Web-posted: 9:54 p.m. Mar. 6, 2001

     The power plant proposed for Pompano Beach moved a step Tuesday toward
     being built, as the state's air-quality regulators announced plans to
     issue a construction permit.
        The state Department of Environmental Protection this week will
     publish notices of its intent to grant the permit to Enron Corp.,
     which is facing vigorous opposition to its plans for a 510-megawatt
     plant just east of Florida's Turnpike. The notices will trigger a
     30-day comment period, with the final decision likely a month or two
     after that.
        The department made the decision after a lengthy review that showed
     the plant would have little impact on the region's air quality, said
     Alvaro Linero, the DEP administrator who handled the permit
     application.
        Relying on clean natural gas as its primary fuel, the plant would
     emit far less pollution than other power plants in the area, he said.
     Its hot gases would soar upward from the 80-foot stacks, so that
     neighborhoods near the plant would experience no more pollution than
     other neighborhoods. And there are commitments on its operating
     schedule and fuel quality that will reduce its environmental impact,
     he said.
        "They showed they will have a fairly minimal impact on air quality
     in the area and will be using the best available control technology,"
     Linero said.
        The plant would operate as a "peaking" plant, meaning it would go
     into service only when a public utility needed a backup source of
     power. Its permit would allow it to operate a maximum of 3,500 hours a
     year, or just under 10 hours a day.
        The plant would emit up to 573 tons a year of nitrogen oxide, a key
     cause of smog, according to the DEP analysis. It would emit up to 165
     tons a year of sulfur dioxide, which generates fine particles that can
     lodge deep in the lungs. Both pollutants can aggravate respiratory
     problems, such as asthma and emphysema.
        But Linero said the amounts would be minimal compared to the total
     amount of pollution in the region. The plant at Port Everglades, for
     example, emits far more of both pollutants. And motor vehicles
     accounted for 32,295 tons of nitrogen oxide in 1997, when Broward
     County last did a full air pollution inventory, according to county
     records.
        A key section of the proposed permit concerns diesel fuel, which
     the company plans to use when its supply of natural gas is
     interrupted. Diesel fuel emits much more pollution than natural gas,
     but the company made some commitments to reduce the effects, Linero
     said.
        It agreed to limit its diesel use to 1,000 hours a year, down from
     its original proposal of 1,500 hours. And for every hour of diesel
     operation over 250 hours, it will reduce its total annual operations
     by two hours. For example, if it uses its maximum 1,000 hours of
     diesel fuel, it will operate the plant for a total of only 2,000 hours
     for the year. The diesel fuel will be high-quality, low-sulfur fuel,
     Linero said.
        "We negotiated with the company to try to minimize the amount of
     diesel fuel usage and maximize the usage of natural gas," he said. "We
     also reviewed the pollution-control equipment that is designed into
     these units and determined that it meets best-available control
     technology."
        The DEP permit represents one of the major hurdles the company
     faces. The other is the application to rezone the 28-acre site for the
     plant. The City Commission is expected to vote next month on whether
     to change the land's zoning from industrial to utility.
        The project faces heavy opposition in Margate, Coconut Creek and
     some sections of Pompano Beach. Nothing that DEP said on Tuesday gave
     opponents any comfort.
        Even if the plant would emit less nitrogen oxide than other plants,
     they said, it would still be a new source of pollution. Even if the
     company agrees to limit its hours and operate it as a peaking plant,
     they said, those restrictions could change once the plant is in place.
     And they said the state had an unimpressive track record on
     environmental protection.
        "The state also approved the deposit of ash in Pompano Beach and
     they also approved the canker eradication program, where healthy trees
     were cut down," said Pompano Beach Commissioner Kay McGinn. "So they
     don't have much credibility."
        Coconut Creek Commissioner Jim Waldman said the plant would
     eventually be able to throw off restrictions on its use and operate as
     a full-time power plant.
        "I don't think it's going to be operated the way it's been applied
     for," he said. "I don't think it's just going to be a peaking plant. I
     think it's going to be operating at capacity. Once it's there, it will
     be easier for the state to allow it to be used as a regular source of
     energy. And I don't think the proper controls will be there at the
     time."
        Officials at Enron, a multinational company based in Houston, said
     the state's decision came as little surprise, since they had been
     negotiating various restrictions on the plant's operations in order to
     win approval.
        "It's a permit that DEP ought to be proud of," said Eric Thode, a
     spokesman for the company. "It's a very stringent permit."
        The department will accept comments on the proposed permit at a
     public meeting from 7:30 to 9 p.m. on March 26 at the Pompano Beach
     Civic Center.
        Written comments may be submitted to: A.A. Linero, Florida
     Department of Environmental Protection, 2600 Blairstone Road,
     Tallahassee, FL 32399.

Good morning,

I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to update you regarding the
Homestead Expansion Precedent Agreements (PA's) status.  As I presented in my
letter to you last month, I expected to be in a position to distribute the 
PA's
this week.  However, that schedule was fairly aggressive and TCO Homestead
project team is currently in the process of completing some critical analysis
that we need to support our recommendations to TCO management.  TCO will
distribute the PA's as soon as TCO management has reviewed and approves the
recommendations made by the Homestead project team.  At this time, I am not
expecting any significant delay and remain hopeful that TCO will be able to
distribute the PA's during the week ending Friday, April 13.  (I am not
superstitious!)  I apologize for any inconvenience this unexpected delay may
cause you.  Please call your account manager or me if you have any questions 
or
special needs related to the Homestead PA's.  Thank you for your patience and
support of this project.  I look forward to working with you in the near
future.

Andrew--

Looks good to me.  I have a question/comment on #3.  When we have talked to
PP&L, it was understanding that if you are buying power from the utility, it
was a sole-serve type of arrangement (you couldn't buy power on the grid).
If this is the case, is there a way that another Enron affiliate or maybe
your wholesale group could perform a swap with the power or the financials
to make it look like we are not taking power from the utility and selling it
in the market?

Subject: Stagecoach - Going Forward



Hey all,

I thought I would put down the steps that need to be done in moving forward
with the Stagecoach deal.  If there is anything I missed, please let me
know.

1. Need to recalculate deal as a 10-year term with updated pricing.

2. Need to explore possibility of receiving gas volumes in the Northern
Storage facility.  Understand that storage and withdrawal fees would apply.

3. Need to address the supply of power during the summer months of June
July and August that would provide maximum optionality for both
participants.  Will explore at least 2 scenarios: First, a minimum load
factor scenario in which power could be interrupted and sold back into the
market with Enron and El Paso sharing in the realized margin, and second, a
separate contract that provided El Paso with the ability to call on power
when they desire to run the electric compressor during those months.  This
could be the most challenging aspect of the deal, so please forward any
other ideas or suggestions.

4. Need to produce operating bands for load factors and corresponding heat
rates.  This includes exploring a ratcheting demand charge where annual
charge could be reduced and operation above a certain load factor would
result in pass through charges.

Once again, thanks to all for a very productive and high-energy meeting.
Let's keep the communication flowing so we can put together the best deal
for everyone involved.

Andrew

Let's talk to John Hodge about that, They deal we did wih CP&L is strucured 
as follows:

April - October 01
Location:         Transco, Z5

volume:     up to 15,000 today
demand fee:    $0.09 per mmbtu  (demand fee charged on the entrie contract 
quantity regardless of quantity scheduled)
price:         Transco, NNY gas daily midpoint

I really do not have an idea of Transco zone 5 or Zone 6 demand and variable 
charges, but I know John Hodge will know.    Let's talk with him.    

Thank you!

Gil,

Note that our forward curves for Transco Zone 5 (summer only) show a basis of 
$.42.  Assuming a $5.00 gas price, the commodity and fuel is $.2437 making 
Piedmont's capacity worth $.1763.  So Keith's current bid of $.19 is in the 
ballpark.  I'm still waiting to hear back from LG&E.   Southern Co. plans on 
getting back with me on this early next week as is Tenaska/PECO as you know.

I will be reviewing the 2001 Budget with Louise and Dave on Thursday.  Louise 
has already hit me up about deal flow.  I need by noon tomorrow all of the 
Not-so-hot-list deals populated.  The form includes a 'Value Estimate 2001" 
categorie.  Make sure that you complete this section.  If it is accrual, then 
put "accrual".  Under "Comments", first insert the date and then provide you 
comments.  BE very descriptive on "Description" and "comments".  Need very 
specific detail in these sections.  If you add a new deal, add a row at the 
bottom of your current list so that all of your activity is grouped 
together.  Within the "Originator Name" area put your name as well as you 
business unit, ( Producer Origination, Mid-market, etc. )

Thank you for your attention to this

If a better understanding of Enron's transactions (a deal) that involves 
Enron's financial as well as commercial participation with another business 
entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you. 

This course will give you a firm grasp of basic finance but in the context of 
Enron's commercial and financial transactions.
The objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, 
to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the 
structure of a deal and provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that 
you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

Subject: Transco's Momentum Expansion and Elba

As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in 
Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of 
$0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in 
Zone 4.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the 
total rate is $0.415.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195.  If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205.  

Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 
85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia.  With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 
gas, the total rate is $0.35.  However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that 
takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39.
This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17.

Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 
3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at 
Elba.  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market.  One alternative 
is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba 
as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub + 
$0.10 at Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Through discussions with Phil Demoes, Southern Company has stated that a 
price of Hub + $0.20 was out of the question.  Phil indicates that we could 
probably strike a deal between their bid of Hub + $0.12 and Hub + $0.17.

I have compiled all the required information needed  to complete  the New 
Shipper Affirmation Form that you faxed me yesterday.  The completed form 
will be faxed to you to sign  as the duly  authorized representative.   I 
will provide copies of the DOE Docket , NEB License Order and the approval 
memo below as support and update authorization changes to Maritime as they 
occur.    Please fax  a  signed copy of the Affirmation Form to me at 
(713)646-8875.  You may fax,  or request that I fax the finished document to 
Maritimes per their directions.   I will need a contact person at Maritime to 
provide pipeline  information on the manifest quantities on a monthly basis 
to insure accurate reporting to Customs.
Thanks,
Juanita

          Ms. Juanita Marchand
          Enron North America Corp.
          1400 Smith Street
          Houston, TX  77002

          Dear Ms. Marchand:

          On January 26, 2001 this office received an E-Mail memo from your
          office outlining a request to file monthly entries in conjunction
          with the importation of natural gas via the Maritimes and
          Northeast Pipeline from the Sable Island Project, Nova Scotia,
          Canada. I would like to clarify one point. The pipeline in
          question is located within the Area Port of Calais, Maine not
          Houlton, Maine as you indicated in your memo..

          Based on the information provided, Enron North America Corp. is
          authorized to import natural gas via the pipeline located in
          Baileyville, ME. Enron must file monthly entries by
          the 15th day of each month at either the Customs Office in
          Calais, ME. or Portland, ME. Customs will reconcile the monthly
          entry against the manifest quantities supplied by the carrier, in
          this case, Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline.

          If you have further concerns please do not hesitate to contact
          this office.

          Sincerely,


          Bruce Mulholland

I have added a second tab to the worksheet which sorts by pipeline (vs region

Important Reminder for ENA Employees

ENA will be rolling out the new Concur Technologies XMS Expense Management 
System March 1, 2001.

XMS will replace the Excel Spreadsheet currently submitted to request expense 
reimbursement. PLEASE NOTE: Those people/teams who have not received training 
are still able to submit reports as before, but teams within ENA are asked to 
transition to XMS as soon as possible following the March 1 target. The 
deadline to transition to XMS is April 1, 2001.

There may be a number of ENA administrative assistants who have already 
received hands-on classroom training and are able to submit both their own 
reports and the reports of those people they support.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

1. XMS Demo
One or more XMS demonstrations had been scheduled in the month of February. 
These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training. 

2. XMS Classroom Training
Please call Maggie Cruz at 3-1816 regarding XMS Training.

3. LEAP online Self-tutorial
Select the following link to access this LEAP self-tutorial.

http://spr2lp1.enron.com/leap_templates/leap_le/login.asp

4. Online documentation
Select the following link to access the written documentation on XMS from 
Concur Technologies.

 http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/xmscheatsheet.doc

Please visit the ISC intranet site for the complete list of documentation on 
XMS.  
XMS also offers an online tour the first time a user logs on.


If you are not able to log into XMS please call the ISC helpdesk

If you have questions about how to use XMS or how to set up 
profiles/workflow, call the Tech Support hotline (713) 853-1411.

John,

LIG is the only pipe that delivers to the LUS generation station and 
therefore does not have a transportation rate.  If you wanted to transport to 
the TransLa/LIG interconnect, you would need to get a rate from LIG.  The 
contact at LIG is Bud Elkins at 832-397-3405.

Can you find out the published rate on LIG without calling them?

Good morning.  I received a call from the Chair's office requesting an 
electronic copy of our customer lists and coverage assignments.  Good thing 
that we have been working on that this week.  In addition they want to meet 
with Scott and me this week on Budget issues.  To that end, it is important 
that we are ready to address several things at today's staff meeting.

Completed, electronic customer lists and coverage assignments.  Because of 
the potential overlap with Fred's group, it is important that the "Producer" 
list be complete.  If the Producer does not show on our list it will, by 
default be covered by Fred's activity.
>From each group- Detailed write ups on a) Key market strategies b) Key 
Products c) Regulatory strategy.  How are you going to make your budget ?


See you are 3:00

Frank

Talked with John Hodge further about the Transco Expansion from Zone 3 to 4 
(Mommentum).  Transco tossed out a rate of $.32 (100% load factor) plus 2.35% 
fuel plus $.026 commodity.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 
fuel), then the total rate is $.44.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Co.'s can pay Transco $.44 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub +$.22.  If you assume a basis of $.04 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $.26.  Note that a hard 
negotiation with Transco could net a better rate than $.44 and that this is 
only what they are proposing.

However, I do not think we will get anywhere close to that with Southern Co. 
given that they can site generation in Zone 2 (Alabama) vs. Zone 3 
(Georgia).  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will serving a peaking market.  Our alternative is 
to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as 
a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub +$.10 at 
Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Southern Co. has stated that a price of Hub +$.20 was out of the question.  
Probably between their bid of $.12 vs. Hub + $.20 is where we could strike a 
deal with them.

John
As discussed on Monday, Enron Canada has agreed to restructure its "Boston 
Gas" agreements with Encal Energy so that Encal will become the shipper of 
record for a portion of the TGP and Iroquois capacity.  They in turn  will 
release back  to ENA for one year each April.  There should be no disruption 
to the East Desk business other than they will have additional contracts to 
manage for the same net volume.

These are the precise releases we would like you to initiate.  What we need 
to know as soon as possible is what if any credit requirements from Encal 
that the pipelines will require.

Ginny,  Please see the attached guaranty.  A clean and redlined version are 
attached.  I revised the language based on our discussions and added the 
language concerning interest which we had both previously approved.  We are 
OK to execute this form.  Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and 
execute.  Thanks.

Here is comments from Brad on his initial assessment of Tennergy.  He is 
working with Williams now to see if his flow analysis is accurate.  We should 
know from Williams shortly and therefore will need to get a handle on how 
much additional transport we will need.

>From the best that I can tell from a GE LM600 catalog, the fuel rate for one 
of these units under average conditions will be 8.4 MMCFD.  The capacity of 
these two 8" lines is between 40-44 MMCFD, but the LDC load number peaks up 
to 25 MMCFD in September.  If you look at just June, July and August, then 
it's still 22 MMCFD.  If the fuel rates from the catalog are correct at 8.4 
MMCFD/unit, then we are looking at 17 MMCFD for two LM6000 units.  This puts 
us at utilizing from 39 MMCFD to 42 MMCFD of a system that has between 40-44 
MMCFD total capacity.  This is way too close for comfort, we need to tighten 
both our LM6000 fuel numbers, our system capacity numbers and the LDC load 
numbers.  You need to get confirmation on what the maximum fuel rate will be 
for two of these units.  I need to get with Jackson Utility to see if their 
peak hour numbers are different from the daily numbers, I'm betting that they 
are.  I need to build a more detailed model of the two 8" pipelines with the 
LDC loads coming off at the right mileposts, with correct efficiency factors 
for the pipe.  I'll get the correct efficiency factors for the pipe by 
simulating an actual flow period on their system.  I'm hoping that they have 
good historical numbers or are willing to gather data on a typical day for me 
to simulate.  I can take my simulation package up to Tennessee and fine tune 
everything, if needed, or do it here in Houston with email and phone.

As a follow up to yesterdays Staff meeting I would like to implement the 
following strategy on getting our "lists" in working order.

Each of the 5 working groups should appoint a lead for that group that will 
be ultimately responsible for the list activity.
Origination and mid-market should work together to prepare 1 combined list.
Producer origination and producer mid-market should work together to prepare 
1 combined list.
By next Monday (Feb 12) I would like to have the combined market list and 
combined producer list identifying target customers and ENA responsibility.  
By Monday (Feb 19) I would like to include Credit, EOL Registered, EOL 
participation level, and existing business.  Select someone in the group to 
work with credit and EOL on these issues.
The final list needs to be in the same format and available electronically.  
Kim Brown will assist in this effort.
Over time each group may expand their working list as needed.



I appreciate your attention to this matter


Frank

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to 
obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying 
costs.  Requests to the Department should be addressed to:  Public Disclosure 
Room, N-5638, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Tammi,

I called Southern Co and they are working on what a demand charge they would 
like to provide 10 day peaking service.  They mentioned that they looked at 
it last year and the price they were being offered was less than if they 
released the capacity as baseload for the entire year (which they did).  

John, can you find out what they did the release for?

So Co will be back at us next week.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.
