IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Increase Means More General Practitioner Involvement
Due to its alarming increase in prevalence in the last twenty years,
diabetes has gone from a "secondary care" or specialty issue to being a
condition in which every primary care physician must be competent to
diagnose and manage.  This article from Pulse recognizes the need for
general practice physicians to expand their diabetes resources and
become more aggressive in diagnosis and treatment.

http://ada.yellowbrix.com/pages/ada/Story.nsp?story_id=24560325&ID=ada

Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the "Return to Your Roots" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.

Justin,

This is Garrett on the Ontario Power Desk.  I will be in the Houston office spending time with the East Power Desk next week.  Let's set up a time for you to run through your Ontario Gas burn model.  Farouk and I do not need a great deal of specific information,  just enough to identify when Lennox is burning gas, and approximately how much.  Monday and Tuesday afternoon are good times for me, reply when you are available.

Garrett

Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.


Please login and enroll through the InvestInMe website, http://www.corptraining.com/index.cfm?company=enron.  If you have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

Does anyone have any email lists that they still use from Lotus Notes - (apart from the main team lists and Michael Kass's Team lists?).

Let me know the addresses and I can get a new mailing list set up in Outlook for you.

Reminder!!!

Please circulate this message to team members/department heads where you feel it is appropriate. Thanks

A mailing group is a collect of people that you email under one common name e.g. Enron London Assistances. In Outlook these are called distribution lists.

We need to migrate all Lotus Notes mailing groups to Outlook. 

If you are responsible for a mailing group, or you have a mailing group for your team, can you please send me the name of it.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

Thanks and regards

Hey fellas,

A couple days left....

If you guys get this today (Thursday) and if you get a chance, could you
call the tux shop and go ahead and pay for your tuxes.  I am going to pick
up all of the tuxes this afternoon and bring them out to the rehearsal
tomorrow.  IF you are in town, you can just go to the shop on Clybourn and
pay for and pick up your tux, otherwise, if you could call and pay with a
credit card, it would make things a lot easier.  I will be going over there
at 1:30 or 2:00 this afternoon.  If you could either call and pay for you
tux or at least let me know that you are planning to pick it up tonight
before 2:00 (Cellular: 773-294-6114), I'd really appreciate it.

Modern Tuxedo
1850 North Clybourn
Chicago
773-388-0800
Hours: 12:00 - 8:00PM



Thanks, guys.

Safe travels.

Jas

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

1. A Simple Step To Prevent Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and Heart
Disease

In a recent study in Washington State, researchers with Premera Blue
Cross found that thousands of patients with high blood pressure,
diabetes, or past heart attacks may be missing the life-enhancing
benefits of the right blood pressure medications. Comparing prescription
guidelines with the drugs actually used by people to control their blood
pressure, the study found that far too many diabetes patients were not
taking the most effective medications or taking no blood pressure
medicine at all. Click here for the full story:

TDS Stage is now pointing to ermtst8i. This is an Oracle 8 version of the TAGG/ERMS database, current as of last Friday. Only the FT-West, GD-West, and FT-Denver desks are active. So far, everything seems to be working (nothing's blown up). As far as I know, no curves have been loaded into the curve cache.  The current plan is to migrate to Oracle 8i in 2 weeks, so now's the time to find problems.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Going forward, I suggest the following.

Procedure for Storage Confirmation and Execution:

1.  Storage contracts mailed to trader.
2.  Trader forwards contract to short-term transport book
3.  Transport book verifies deal terms, sends a copy to back office, gets approriate signature on original, mail original to counterparty, contact counterparty to inform them that contract is executed and mailed back.
4.  Back office verifies terms, add contract to a binder, send copy to confirmation group.  
5.  Confirmation group verifies terms, add contract to their files, send a copy to Global group to scan contract in the system in order to view contract on-line via Information Management System

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

1. Nutrition Program Unveiled for Hispanics and Latinos

The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP), sponsored by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes
of Health, recently launched a nutrition campaign targeting Hispanics
and Latinos who have diabetes or are at high risk of developing the
disease, and their families. Called "It's more than food, it's life,"
the campaign focuses on educating Hispanics and Latinos about ways they
can continue to eat their favorite, traditional foods even if they have
diabetes, if they reduce portion sizes and alter preparation methods.
For more information on this story, click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/052401_Nutrition.asp



2. Many Diabetes Patients Unaware of Cardiovascular Risks

Insulin resistance, a major factor in type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, is
a condition in which the body cannot use the insulin it produces
effectively. One effect of insulin resistance is heightened levels of
artery-clogging LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In a recent survey of
type 2 diabetes patients sponsored by Partners Against Insulin
Resistance (PAIR), only 52 percent recognized the term insulin
resistance, and just over 50 percent recognized the association between
insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For more
information on this story, click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/052401_CVD.asp



3. Study Finds That Diabetes Doubles Risk for Depression

Diabetes patients are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those
who do not have diabetes, according to a new study to be published in
the June issue of Diabetes Care. Conducted jointly by researchers at the
Washington University School of Medicine and the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri, the study is the first to
provide a firm estimate of how likely patients are to suffer from both
depression and diabetes. For more information on this story, click on
the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/ada/depression.asp

For recent media coverage of the study, click on the link below:

4. ADA Helps Lead Cardiovascular Program in Atlanta

The Cardiovascular Learning Partnership (CLP), an organization made up
of the American Diabetes Association and four other national
non-profits, is using a $750,000 grant by the Guidant Foundation to fund
an education and outreach program for Atlanta African Americans with
diabetes and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The program,
consisting of an awareness campaign and a multi-site clinical project,
aims to empower African American diabetes patients to secure proper CVD
interventions, and to give health professionals better tools to provide
the highest quality of care. For more information on this story, click
on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/ada/atlantacardio.asp



5. The Art of Empowerment: Stories and Strategies for Diabetes Educators

This thought-provoking book will teach you to create a new partnership
with your patients. A partnership that allows you to blend what you know
about diabetes and sound, responsible diabetes care with what your
patients know about themselves. This is a very special book that will
make you think, reflect, consider your role as a diabetes professional.
It will help you empower yourself as you empower your patients. For more
information or to order this book, click on the following link:

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am

IN THE NEWS...
Medicare Funds Nutritional Therapy
On January 1, 2002, Medicare began covering medical nutritional therapy for many recipients with diabetes and kidney diseases. With this new benefit, around 4.5 million Medicare recipients with diabetes and an estimated 110,000 with kidney disease are eligible for medical nutritional therapy aimed at helping them learn to make healthy eating choices and better manage their conditions.  The comments of Anne Daly, the Association's President, Health Care & Education, are featured in this article from The Washington Post covering the new benefit.

FDA Approves Generic Metformin
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted approval to eleven generic drug manufacturers to market generic versions of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's popular diabetes medication Glucophage (metformin).  Glucophage is taken orally in pill form, and is currently the world's top-selling diabetes medication. The drug reduces blood sugar levels by curbing production of glucose by the liver.

Sexual Problems in Men With Diabetes, and More from Diabetes Care
According to a study published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research, more than one-third of adult men with diabetes experience sexual dysfunction.  Also in the February issue, a separate study shows that a particular type of weight-loss surgery can dramatically improve the health of severely obese people with diabetes, and in some cases even send the disease into remission.

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

For additional information, visit HGO's web site at www.houstongrandopera.org. Also see volunteer opportunities below.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Geoff - 

Attached for your approval are four confirmations for the Ring Trades done among Enron,
Reliant, and Bank of Montreal:

    

You will note that an Exhibit A is attached to each confirm - but  can you tell me from
whom at both counterparties I can obtain the Exhibit B (transaction b/t Reliant and BOM)
in order to attach that as well.  

Please review and advise.

Our third party hosting facility changed a router configuration setting that caused us to lose connectivity to all of our traders today at 12:50 pm. The change to the router was unauthorized and we are meeting with the hosting facility today to insure that something like this does not happen again during trading hours. All traders were logged out and all orders pulled from the market during the outage. We are in the process of bringing the system back online and we expect the system to be back online by 2:15 ET.

Hi Geoff,

Chris Gaskill said you might be able to help me out. 

 I am working on an eCommerce report for EOL and I am trying to determine who the players are for trading nat gas online.  (Of course, all of the companies I have researched say they are leading the market)...Any way, I was wondering what online trading plaforms you use for trading nat gas besides EOL.  If you could help me out that would be great. 

Thanks,
Angela Saenz

1. A Simple Step To Prevent Diabetes, High Blood Pressure and Heart
Disease

In a recent study in Washington State, researchers with Premera Blue
Cross found that thousands of patients with high blood pressure,
diabetes, or past heart attacks may be missing the life-enhancing
benefits of the right blood pressure medications. Comparing prescription
guidelines with the drugs actually used by people to control their blood
pressure, the study found that far too many diabetes patients were not
taking the most effective medications or taking no blood pressure
medicine at all. Click here for the full story:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/053101_simple.asp



2. The American Diabetes Association 61st Scientific Sessions is Fast
Approaching

The American Diabetes Association 61st Scientific Sessions is scheduled
to occur in Philadelphia, PA, June 22- 26, 2001. This year's program is
the most extensive ever, offering over 140 sessions across 9 theme
areas. For more information or to register for this meeting, click on
the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/am01



3. Los Angeles Postgraduate Course

The Los Angeles Postgraduate Course will take place on July 21, 2001, at
the Los Angeles Marriott Downtown. Plans for the program include
sessions on Obesity and Type 2 in Children, New Diabetes Treatments and
Therapies, Nutrition and Clinical Management of CVD in Diabetes. In
addition, workshops and meet-the-professor sessions include
Contraception and Pre-conception Care in Women with Diabetes, Cost
Effective Patient Education, Pharmacologic Treatment of Type 2,
Management of Type 2 in Children, and Reaching Lipid and Blood Pressure
Goals. For more information or to register for this meeting, click on
the following link:

4. Review of DiabetesOneStop.com

Medical writer and Internet journalist Rick Mendosa investigates the
services and people of the diabetes-focused Web site
DiabetesOneStop.com. The site targets four primary audiences: health
care professionals, people working for the pharmaceutical industry,
scientists, and those living with diabetes. Praised by Mendosa for its
diverse content and usability, the site offers educational materials,
clinical and scientific articles, as well as conference abstracts and
reports.

http://www.diabetes.org/mendosa/June0101.asp


5. Facilitating Lifestyle Change: A Resource Manual

At last, a resource to help you effect positive behavioral change in
your patients with diabetes. This valuable tool approaches lifestyle
change through a four-step model - Assessment, Goal Setting,
Intervention, and Evaluation and features a series of reproducible forms
to facilitate data collection and monitoring.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

I am free in the morning until 11:00 am.  I think that Todd Busby should sit in on the meeting, since he is been so involved in the discussions with Sithe.

Subject:	Sithe TCPL transport

I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.  I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.  I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.  However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.  Thanks.

Should You Consider Margin?

For Customers with Margin Accounts: Margin Risk Disclosure

TD Waterhouse is furnishing this information to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin. Securities purchased on margin are
TD Waterhouse's collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, TD Waterhouse can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with
TD Waterhouse, in order to maintain the required equity in the account. Please note that trading on margin may not be appropriate for all customers. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. 

These risks include the following:


You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.

TD Waterhouse can force the sale of securities or other assets in
your account(s).

TD Waterhouse can sell your securities or other assets without
contacting you.

You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call.

TD Waterhouse can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice.

You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.

  _____  


Should You Consider Margin?
If you are comfortable with the risks associated with margin, you may want to consider adding margin privileges to your account. Margin allows you to use the equity in your account as collateral for a loan that may be used for the purchase of additional securities or for overdraft protection if you have check writing privileges. 

Add Margin Privileges to Your Account <http://tdwaterhouse.ip02.com/rd/9z1zue775eg89lsahmemot5499rbgj2f98vufvnp1o0>


Please note that margin privileges may be added to Individual, Joint and other qualified account types. Certain accounts, including retirement (IRA) and custodial accounts, are not eligible for margin privileges.

If you have any questions, please call a TD Waterhouse customer service representative at 1-800-934-4448 and press 4.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

7. New Guidelines Call for More Aggressive Cholesterol Treatment

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some 53 million
Americans have high cholesterol and the U.S. death toll from heart
disease is about 500,000 a year. To try and reduce these numbers and
prolong lives, the NIH has formed new guidelines for physicians treating
people at risk for heart disease. The new, more aggressive guidelines,
released Tuesday, May 15, add diabetes and metabolic syndrome to the
conditions indicating an increased risk for heart disease, recommend
different tests to screen for high cholesterol, and offer modified
standards for good and bad cholesterol. The NIH expects the numbers of
Americans using prescribed cholesterol drugs and following prescribed,
cholesterol-lowering diets to grow sharply  For more information on this

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Care Not Linked to Learning Problems
Researchers at the University of Iowa have good news for children with type 1 diabetes.  A recent study conducted there found that children with type 1 diabetes do not experience any learning problems from their diabetes treatments.  The findings, which counter earlier research linking diabetes treatment to learning troubles, appear in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.

Managing Stress Could Help Control Blood Sugar
Stress has often been associated with elevated blood sugar in people with diabetes, but until now, there have been no large clinical studies exploring how stress management therapy might help people with the disease control their blood sugar.  New research reported by Richard Surwit, PhD., and a team from the Duke University Medical Center, found that people with type 2 diabetes that incorporate stress management into their daily lives can significantly improve blood sugar control.  The study was published in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care.

Mothers Who Smoke Could Create Diabetes Risk
Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden finds another reason for people not to smoke.  The children of women who smoke during pregnancy could be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life, according to the new study published in this month's British Medical Journal.

Florida Newborns Offered Diabetes Screening
Florida will soon be the first U.S. state to offer every newborn a chance to be screened for risk of type 1 diabetes.  A voluntary program funded by a $10 million endowment created by the American Diabetes Association, the new initiative will identify babies at high risk for the disease and continue to monitor them throughout their lives.  The program will be based at the University of Florida College of Medicine and become available within 1 1/2 years.

NEWLY SCHEDULED! Healthcare Financing in the 21st Century: Cost Implications for Employers, Insurers and Policy Makers, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association
Considerable attention and emphasis is given to medical decision-making that addresses the impact of disease on the direct costs of treatment; however, most current decision-making paradigms ignore the patient and family costs and the impacts of disease and treatment on worker productivity.  Indirect costs constitute more than half of total health care costs for most diseases. This conference aims to focus on three specific actions plans to address these indirect costs.

FYI,
 
    If your cellular phone bill was submitted for payment prior to December 17th, it was covered under pre-petition.  Meaning that the invoices were processed and placed in the system, but not paid.  Let me know if you have any questions.
 

Thank you,

  The aggregator's tweaked production code, and there's no telling how the position manager in parallel'll react.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

I would think we need the dates from the trigger, otherwise those killed deals will remain in their Cash Position amounts.

Subject:	Problem with killed CPR deals & Deal Ticker


  When a deal is killed in CPR, the detail record gets deleted. Consequently, when CPRReader picks up the change, it has no idea what the start and end dates for the record are, and doesn't publish anything for those values. When Deal Ticker gets the deal, it uses the "0" date, Dec 30, 1899 for the start and end dates.

Possible fixes would include having Deal Ticker just not display dates when they're not known, or having the CPR triggers put the start and end dates in the TDS table when a deal is killed.

NEWS...
Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

An Inspiring Story from America's WALK for Diabetes
11-year-old Tyler Smith, of Chesterfield, MO, was diagnosed with
diabetes at the age of 14 months.  The now sixth-grader has been testing
his own blood sugar since he was 2 ? years old.  Described as an
inspiring, "seasoned fund-raiser," Tyler raised over $6,000 for last
week's American Diabetes Association's America's WALK for Diabetes held
in St. Louis.  Remarkably, since 1995 alone, he has raised at least
$20,000 for the Association and diabetes research.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the "Return to Your Roots" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.

TYPE 1 DIABETES...

Is Controlling your Blood Sugar Challenging?

complications of diabetes, giving you extra years of healthy, active

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

IN THE NEWS...
New Federal Initiative to Focus on Diabetes and Women
Of the estimated 16 million Americans with diabetes, more than half are women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently launched its new three-phased initiative on women and diabetes.  The initiative, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association,  the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), will work to curb the recent rise in diabetes among women.

Eat Your Way to Better Health
The American Diabetes Association released new nutritional guidelines in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research.  The new guidelines emphasize recent evidence that exercise and lifestyle choices can play major roles in managing and even preventing diabetes.  Other interesting studies in the January issue include research on how stress management can affect blood sugar and the annual costs diabetes expenses cost employers.

A Few Sips a Day Could Cut Heart Disease Risk
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that men with type 2 diabetes who consume moderate amounts of alcohol each day reduce their risk of heart disease.  Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one-half to two drinks daily cut their heart disease risk by 36 percent, and men who drank more than two drinks a day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart problems.

I have talked with them about phys rings. But the primary counterparty i was going to use was Dynegy. The trading wanted to make some money to do the deal, but i'm not sure where we stand with the other Dynegy stuff going on. So i'm on a holding pattern with Mirant unless you have any suggestions. geof

Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

	? Company recruiters had logged on more than 3,500 times to search for candidates
	? More than 600 jobs had been posted on the site

The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

conference for alumni professionals of the top-tier business schools.
During the two-day Annual Business School Alumni Professionals (ABSAP)
Conference, alumni professionals from twenty-one different institutions,
from Harvard to Haas, were in Bloomington to discuss the many issues
facing alumni relations. Conference sessions covered everything from
alumni outreach to technology to alumni communications and services. The
information exchange and the opportunity to network with peers were
invaluable. The good news from the conference is that Kelley alumni
efforts are right in line with the services provided by other top-tier
schools. Given the success of this year's program, we will be hosting the
conference again in June of 2002. If you are interested in more details

accounting and information systems and to formulate and implement
solutions to these problems. Emphasis is placed on critical thinking in
problem identification and solution implementation. There is a strong
orientation toward developing skills that will be useful in
problem?solving situations: leadership, teamwork/collaboration skills,
critical/creative skills; oral and written communications, and
self?assessment. Among the local firms that hosted field projects are
Bloomington Hospital, Boston Scientific, C&M Conveyor, City Grille,
Commercial Service, Cook, Inc., IU Speech and Hearing, IU Residence Halls,
Stonebelt Center, and TIS. Other Indiana companies that have benefitted
from these consulting services include Ernst & Young, Financial Services
Group, Indiana CPA Society, Eli Lilly & Company, Pratt Corp., Reilly
Industries, and Village Venture. For more information about the Kelley
School's Systems & Accounting Graduate Programs, go to

"Web MBAs Make the Grade"


You're a senior analyst with a utility company, the father of three, you
devote lots of time to coaching their sports teams, and you want to get an
MBA. If you're Rick Hensley, with Cinergy Corp. near Indianapolis, you
enroll in the online MBA program at the Kelley School. "I didn't want to
miss two or three years of my children's lives," he says. "My options were
either to find something online or wait five or six years." Now he reads
his professors' weekly lectures and completes the assignments when it
suits his schedule, and he'll get his degree this year. John Shade, chief
engineer of Rolls?Royce's 501k?engine program in Indianapolis, says, "I
thought that if I was going to invest the effort to get an MBA, I would do
it only through a high?caliber program." Shade made his move when IU began
offering its two?year program online.

"Few Countries Enforcing Insider Trading Laws"

Finance Professor Utpal Bhattacharya is extensively quoted in Alison
Beard's article on his study (in cooperation with Kelley doctoral student
Hazem Daouk) of the world's 103 stock markets. The study, soon to be
published in the "Journal of Finance," contends that nearly 85 percent of
the world's stock markets have laws against insider trading but only
one?third have enforced them. And in countries where no insiders have been
prosecuted, companies pay an average of 5 percent extra to raise capital.
"That is the price of honesty," he says. Bhattacharya argues that
"controlling large shareholders could easily be tempted by management to
make profits from stock tips rather than... from hard?to?do monitoring.
Knowing this, [other] shareholders would demand a higher return on
equity."

LOS ANGELES TIMES

"Companies' Downsizing Efforts May Not Boost Earnings But Just Lower
Morale"

The strategy you employ to rescue your company from the brink might just
shove it over the cliff. So said researchers at IU's Kelley School of
Business who studied the downsizing efforts of eight large U.S.
corporations in the 1990s. "Only half of the downsizings... we studied
actually resulted in increased profits," said Vince Mabert, professor of
operations and decision technologies.

THE NEW YORK TIMES

"Wall Street Falls Into Bear Territory"

Investors typically seek safe havens in bonds and money market funds when
the stock market tanks. Chuck Trzcinka, the Cozad Chair in Finance, says
it's difficult to determine when to get out of those more stable
investments and put the money back into the stock market. That' why some
market players like to put their money into companies they know will
produce profits whether the economy is good or bad. "They're not the high
flyers, but they're certainly stable and they're going to be with us," he
says. "Just because the stock market is down, it doesn't mean you don't
need houses to live in and food to eat and clothing to wear." He adds,
"There are no surefire rules to make money in a bear market, but the bears
eventually hibernate." The Associated Press article also appeared in Fox
Market Wire, "Salt Lake Tribune," "Everett (WA) Herald," "Allentown
Morning Call," "Charleston (SC) Net," "Oklahoma City Oklahoman," "Chicago
Sun?Times," "Denver Rocky Mountain News," and "Modesto Bee."

WESTWOOD ONE RADIO NETWORK

1. Western Diet Linked to Diabetes in Native Americans

For the Pima Indians of Arizona, diabetes has reached epidemic
proportions. About 50% of Pima adults between the ages of 30 and 64 have
diabetes, giving this community the highest rate of type 2 diabetes in
the world.  A recent study published in the May issue of Diabetes Care
shows that Pima Indians who have adopted a Western diet high in simple
carbohydrates and low in vegetable protein and fiber are three times
more likely to develop diabetes over six years than their counterparts
who eat a more traditional diet rich in fresh produce and whole grains.

2. Team Diabetes Runner Sets Inspiring Example

A 54-year-old endocrinologist and nephrologist, who admits to being far
from a world-class athlete, has turned his passion for helping people
with diabetes into a drive to compete in marathons and raise money for
the American Diabetes Association.  For more information on this story,
click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/051701_Runner.asp



3. Diabetes School Care Act Nears Passage in Oklahoma

Children with diabetes must meet the daily challenge of managing healthy
blood sugar levels while attending school.  Unfortunately, many schools
lack personnel who are trained to recognize the warning signs of low and
high blood sugar levels and to help when children with diabetes
experience problems. The Diabetes School Care Act provides for proper
training of school personnel to increase their awareness of diabetes and
its symptoms, and calls for specific actions personnel should take in
during diabetes-related emergencies.  The bill has passed both houses
and currently awaits final committee edits before the legislature will
send it to the governor's desk.  For more information on this story,
click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/051701_School.asp



4. New Guidelines Call for More Aggressive Cholesterol Treatment

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some 53 million
Americans have high cholesterol and the U.S. death toll from heart
disease is about 500,000 a year. To try and reduce these numbers and
prolong lives, the NIH has formed new guidelines for physicians treating
people at risk for heart disease.  The new, more aggressive guidelines,
released Tuesday, May 15, add diabetes and metabolic syndrome to the
conditions indicating an increased risk for heart disease, recommend
different tests to screen for high cholesterol, and offer modified
standards for good and bad cholesterol. The NIH expects the numbers of
Americans using prescribed cholesterol drugs and following prescribed,
cholesterol-lowering diets to grow sharply.  For more information on
this story, click on the following link:

7. New Guidelines Call for More Aggressive Cholesterol Treatment

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some 53 million
Americans have high cholesterol and the U.S. death toll from heart
disease is about 500,000 a year. To try and reduce these numbers and
prolong lives, the NIH has formed new guidelines for physicians treating
people at risk for heart disease. The new, more aggressive guidelines,
released Tuesday, May 15, add diabetes and metabolic syndrome to the
conditions indicating an increased risk for heart disease, recommend
different tests to screen for high cholesterol, and offer modified
standards for good and bad cholesterol. The NIH expects the numbers of
Americans using prescribed cholesterol drugs and following prescribed,
cholesterol-lowering diets to grow sharply  For more information on this

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

OLD OAKEN BUCKET GAME THIS SATURDAY - IU and Purdue square off for their
104th meeting and the 77th battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, making it one
of the country's most storied football rivalries. IU had its hopes for a
bowl game dashed this past week at Penn State as the Hoosiers fell to the
Nittany Lions, 28-14, despite 366 total yards from Heisman Trophy
candidate Antwaan Randle El. They hope to finish the season strong with
wins against Purdue and Kentucky.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Hi Geoff,

How are you? How's Vicki doing? Is she and the baby already at home?

Vladi probably told you about the reorg in EES. Currently I am looking for a position in Commodity Structuring (Gas or Power). 
Do you by chance know anybody who I can talk to about a position in these groups?

Natalie

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( <http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html>), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Geoff--

	If I could get just a few moments of your time today or tommorow, at your convenience, in order to discuss the web-based portal project I emailed you about yesterday, it would be of great assistance to me.  All I need to do is briefly interview you regarding what you would like to see on a page like the one which has been proposed.  I have once again enclosed a brief summary of the principles underlying this project.  Thank you very much for your assistance.

Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

News on NCEP III
The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has introduced new guidelines for evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.  The revised guidelines use the Framingham Point Score in determining risk assessment of new cardiac events within a 10-year period.  In a notable new feature of the guidelines, the Expert Panel has now recommended that the presence of diabetes be thought of as equivalent to the presence of established heart disease.  The new guidelines also target the newly defined metabolic syndrome as a target for aggressive preventive therapy.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, such diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

IN THE NEWS...
New Federal Initiative to Focus on Diabetes and Women
Of the estimated 16 million Americans with diabetes, more than half are women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently launched its new three-phased initiative on women and diabetes.  The initiative, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association,  the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), will work to curb the recent rise in diabetes among women.

Eat Your Way to Better Health
The American Diabetes Association released new nutritional guidelines in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research.  The new guidelines emphasize recent evidence that exercise and lifestyle choices can play major roles in managing and even preventing diabetes.  Other interesting studies in the January issue include research on how stress management can affect blood sugar and the annual costs diabetes expenses cost employers.

Overfeeding Rapidly Induces Leptin and Insulin Resistance
Hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia coexist in common forms of obesity. A team of researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, recently demonstrated that overfeeding mice induces leptin and insulin resistance in test subjects.  The study, led by Dr. Luciano Rossetti, was published in the December, 2001 issue of the journal Diabetes.

A Few Sips a Day Could Cut Heart Disease Risk
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that men with type 2 diabetes who consume moderate amounts of alcohol each day reduce their risk of heart disease.  Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one-half to two drinks daily cut their heart disease risk by 36 percent, and men who drank more than two drinks a day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart problems.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

IU News 010518
May 18, 2001

Welcome to IU News. Please pass this on to other alumni and friends of IU
who you believe may be interested.

GET WIRED TO IU:

HOOSIERS RETURN FROM THE GREAT WALL - The IU School of Health, Physical
Education and Recreation delegation that hiked the Great Wall of China has
returned home. Relive the group's 11-day adventure on IU's Great Wall Walk
Web site.
        http://www.greatwallwalk.indiana.edu/

QUALITY:

IU PROFESSOR ELECTED TO AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES - Thomas J.
Mathiesen, Distinguished Professor and David H. Jacobs Chair in Music at
the IU School of Music, has joined a distinguished list of national
colleagues in one of the most prestigious academic organizations in the
world, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Considered the world's
leading specialist in ancient Greek music, Mathiesen is director of the IU
Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature.
        http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/ocm/releases/aaas01.htm

IUPUI PROFESSOR HONORED FOR WORK WITH CHILDREN - Longtime children's
rights advocate and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis
education professor Stuart Hart of Noblesville, Ind., received the
prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash Award at a retirement party last month.
Former Lt. Gov. John Mutz presented Hart with the award in honor of his
work on behalf of children. "Through his passion for children, he has
instilled in an international cadre of professionals a desire to improve
the lot of children across the world," Mutz said. Hart is retiring this
month after 30 years as an instructor at IUPUI.
        http://www.iupui.edu/news/hartaward.htm

RESEARCH:

IU RESEARCHERS RELEASE CENSUS STUDY - Indiana's population is aging, with
the state's median age at 35.2 in 2000, up from 32.8 in 1990 and 29.2 in
1980, according to data released May 17 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Half of
the population are older than the median age and half are younger. An
analysis of the data was released by Joan P. Morand, research director
with the Indiana Business Research Center in IU's Kelley School of
Business. IBRC serves as the state's official liaison with the U.S. Bureau
of the Census and regularly analyzes state population trends.
        http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/ocm/releases/census0501.htm

ZERO EVIDENCE FOR ZERO TOLERANCE IN SCHOOLS - Can the use of zero
tolerance in school discipline improve student behavior or lead to safer
schools? Probably not, concludes a report released May 15 by the Indiana
Education Policy Center at the IU School of Education in Bloomington. The
report finds that although the use of suspension and expulsion for
non-dangerous behavior places an increasing number of students at risk for
being removed from school, those risks are in no way justified by the
results of the policy.
        http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/ocm/releases/zerotolerance.htm

SPORTS:

MEN'S BASKETBALL NON-CONFERENCE SCHEDULE - IU men's basketball coach Mike
Davis announced the 2001-02 non-conference schedule. The season will
include games at the Great Alaska Shootout, the Big Ten/ACC Challenge and
the Orange Bowl Classic in Miami. The Hoosiers also will face the
University of Kentucky Wildcats at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis and the
University of Louisville Cardinals at Assembly Hall.

http://www.indiana.edu/~athlweb/graphic/sports/m-bkball/mbkpress/01-02/mbk05-14-01.html

TRACKING THE HOOSIERS - For the fourth time in its history, IU will host
the Big Ten Men's and Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championships in
Bloomington at the Robert C. Haugh Track and Field Complex, E.C. Billy
Hayes Track, May 18-20. The site also played host to the outdoor
conference meet in 1966, 1970 and 1977, as well as the 1997 NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships.

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Care Not Linked to Learning Problems
Researchers at the University of Iowa have good news for children with type 1 diabetes.  A recent study conducted there found that children with type 1 diabetes do not experience any learning problems from their diabetes treatments.  The findings, which counter earlier research linking diabetes treatment to learning troubles, appear in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.

Managing Stress Could Help Control Blood Sugar
Stress has often been associated with elevated blood sugar in people with diabetes, but until now, there have been no large clinical studies exploring how stress management therapy might help people with the disease control their blood sugar.  New research reported by Richard Surwit, PhD., and a team from the Duke University Medical Center, found that people with type 2 diabetes that incorporate stress management into their daily lives can significantly improve blood sugar control.  The study was published in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care.

Mothers Who Smoke Could Create Diabetes Risk
Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden finds another reason for people not to smoke.  The children of women who smoke during pregnancy could be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life, according to the new study published in this month's British Medical Journal.

Florida Newborns Offered Diabetes Screening
Florida will soon be the first U.S. state to offer every newborn a chance to be screened for risk of type 1 diabetes.  A voluntary program funded by a $10 million endowment created by the American Diabetes Association, the new initiative will identify babies at high risk for the disease and continue to monitor them throughout their lives.  The program will be based at the University of Florida College of Medicine and become available within 1 1/2 years.

NEWLY SCHEDULED! Healthcare Financing in the 21st Century: Cost Implications for Employers, Insurers and Policy Makers, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association
Considerable attention and emphasis is given to medical decision-making that addresses the impact of disease on the direct costs of treatment; however, most current decision-making paradigms ignore the patient and family costs and the impacts of disease and treatment on worker productivity.  Indirect costs constitute more than half of total health care costs for most diseases. This conference aims to focus on three specific actions plans to address these indirect costs.

IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

News on NCEP III
The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has introduced new guidelines for evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.  The revised guidelines use the Framingham Point Score in determining risk assessment of new cardiac events within a 10-year period.  In a notable new feature of the guidelines, the Expert Panel has now recommended that the presence of diabetes be thought of as equivalent to the presence of established heart disease.  The new guidelines also target the newly defined metabolic syndrome as a target for aggressive preventive therapy.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, such diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

ATHLETICS:

MEN'S SOCCER TEAM TAKES NINTH BIG TEN CROWN - With a scoreless tie at the
end of the first half, Hoosier fans were a little worried about just how
many minutes of soccer were going to be played to determine a Big Ten
champion last Sunday (Nov. 11) in Madison. With 32:02 remaining in the
game, the Indiana men's soccer team put all fears to rest, scoring the
game-winner against Michigan State. The Hoosiers won their ninth
conference championship 2-0 over the Spartans. They now look ahead to the
NCAA tourney and seek a sixth national championship.

Dear You Bean, 

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel: 

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft. 

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight. 

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
http://continentalairlines.rsc01.net/servlet/cc4?JHEVCU*nlmhkLSQLJmELgkhgEJht*z*UA
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard! 

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

It's that time of year again...Thanksgiving.  And with it comes the
beginning of another festive holiday season. During this hectic time,
you'll tend to do things that are out of your normal routine: shopping
at the mall for hours on end, snacking in-between meals, eating out and
traveling.  This crazy schedule can often affect you and your blood
sugar - sometimes you may not even realize it.  The ADA has resources
that can help.

TRAVEL...
Wouldn't it be great if someone made your packing lists and wrote down
all the things you need to do before you travel? Well, someone has.
Check out the ADA's The Diabetes Travel Guide, by clicking here:

SNACKING...
Ever feel like everyone can eat junk food but you?  Finally, a
collection of snack recipes for people with diabetes! The Diabetes
Snack, Munch, Nibble, and Nosh Book features snack ideas for parties and
crowds that are diabetes-friendly. Now even YOU can enjoy festive food
items such as chili con queso, chips and black bean salsa, pesto, and
muffins.

Angela, is there any way to identify the directory paths for the data contained in the attached document?  Is the data contained on the O:\ M:\ drive?  What is the full directory path....O:\directoryname\directoryname\etc.....?  This information will assist us in determining exactly what needs migrated. I am available to meet anytime and assist in anyway possible.  Thanks in advance.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

The Best to You in 2002
  <http://img.ipost.com/client/t/tdwaterhouse/011102/baby.gif>By almost any measure, 2001 has been - at best - a very challenging year. Between the markets and the economy, the 
tragic events of September, and the current uncertainty in foreign affairs, it's been quite a bumpy ride. Even so, there are promising signs that 2002 will see a return to more normal times. With that thought in mind, TD Waterhouse wants to wish you and your family a happy, healthy, and prosperous new year.

We thank you for your past business and look forward to continuing to help you manage your money successfully.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)
Cal 4      1921
Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Thanks,

I purchased 6172 day from the Canadian desk at NFUL Niagara (deal 802218).  The price is NX1 plus $.23.

The buyer is East TP3.  The seller may be wrong.

Please forward to Mr. Storey's book admin.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker.

TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly.  

                          Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc.   However since CPR numbers can change
                          when the deal is revised, it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to. Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change.
                          Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets.

TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid

                          Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect.  Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large,
                          such as IF-NGPL/Harper, that has a premium of $.22.
                          The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has.  Valuation can then include premium into the calc.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

"To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling." --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Reminder:  Brown Bag Lunch, Thursday, May 17 at 11:30 AM in 5 C2. The speaker is Michael L. Miller discussing Principal Investments.

"Historically, Newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to "very discriminating" buyers at newspaper publishers. EIM believed differently.  By the end of March, EIM had succeeded in closing on its 2nd Newsprint mill, making it the 7th largest Newsprint manufacturer in North America.  Remarkably, in just 2 months, EIM's Newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100MM total notional value "Enron commodity style" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?..and they said it wasn't a commodity."
Rodney Malcolm - Vice President, Forest Products Sales and Marketing

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 		

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. 

But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. 

Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. 

Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. 

As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. 

Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. 

Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. 

Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. 

Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. 

The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life." 

Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. 

UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities." 

The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. 

The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections. 

Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

1. Nutrition Program Unveiled for Hispanics and Latinos

The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP), sponsored by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes
of Health, recently launched a nutrition campaign targeting Hispanics
and Latinos who have diabetes or are at high risk of developing the
disease, and their families. Called "It's more than food, it's life,"
the campaign focuses on educating Hispanics and Latinos about ways they
can continue to eat their favorite, traditional foods even if they have
diabetes, if they reduce portion sizes and alter preparation methods.
For more information on this story, click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/052401_Nutrition.asp



2. Many Diabetes Patients Unaware of Cardiovascular Risks

Insulin resistance, a major factor in type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, is
a condition in which the body cannot use the insulin it produces
effectively. One effect of insulin resistance is heightened levels of
artery-clogging LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In a recent survey of
type 2 diabetes patients sponsored by Partners Against Insulin
Resistance (PAIR), only 52 percent recognized the term insulin
resistance, and just over 50 percent recognized the association between
insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For more
information on this story, click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/052401_CVD.asp



3. Study Finds That Diabetes Doubles Risk for Depression

Diabetes patients are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those
who do not have diabetes, according to a new study to be published in
the June issue of Diabetes Care. Conducted jointly by researchers at the
Washington University School of Medicine and the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri, the study is the first to
provide a firm estimate of how likely patients are to suffer from both
depression and diabetes. For more information on this story, click on
the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/ada/depression.asp

For recent media coverage of the study, click on the link below:

4. ADA Helps Lead Cardiovascular Program in Atlanta

The Cardiovascular Learning Partnership (CLP), an organization made up
of the American Diabetes Association and four other national
non-profits, is using a $750,000 grant by the Guidant Foundation to fund
an education and outreach program for Atlanta African Americans with
diabetes and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The program,
consisting of an awareness campaign and a multi-site clinical project,
aims to empower African American diabetes patients to secure proper CVD
interventions, and to give health professionals better tools to provide
the highest quality of care. For more information on this story, click
on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/ada/atlantacardio.asp



5. The Art of Empowerment: Stories and Strategies for Diabetes Educators

This thought-provoking book will teach you to create a new partnership
with your patients. A partnership that allows you to blend what you know
about diabetes and sound, responsible diabetes care with what your
patients know about themselves. This is a very special book that will
make you think, reflect, consider your role as a diabetes professional.
It will help you empower yourself as you empower your patients. For more
information or to order this book, click on the following link:

6. The American Diabetes Association 61st Scientific Sessions is Fast
Approaching

The American Diabetes Association 61st Scientific Sessions is scheduled
to occur in Philadelphia, PA, June 22- 26, 2001. This year's program is

areas. For more information or to register for this meeting, click on

The Los Angeles Postgraduate Course will take place on July 21, 2001, at
the Los Angeles Marriott Downtown. Plans for the program include
sessions on Obesity and Type 2 in Children, New Diabetes Treatments and
Therapies, Nutrition and Clinical Management of CVD in Diabetes. In

1. Nutrition Program Unveiled for Hispanics and Latinos

The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP), sponsored by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes
of Health, recently launched a nutrition campaign targeting Hispanics
and Latinos who have diabetes or are at high risk of developing the
disease, and their families. Called "It's more than food, it's life,"
the campaign focuses on educating Hispanics and Latinos about ways they
can continue to eat their favorite, traditional foods even if they have
diabetes, if they reduce portion sizes and alter preparation methods.

2. Many Diabetes Patients Unaware of Cardiovascular Risks

Insulin resistance, a major factor in type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, is
a condition in which the body cannot use the insulin it produces
effectively. One effect of insulin resistance is heightened levels of
artery-clogging LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In a recent survey of
Type 2 diabetes patients sponsored by Partners Against Insulin
Resistance (PAIR), only 52 percent recognized the term insulin
resistance, and just over 50 percent recognized the association between
insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). For more
information on this story, click on the following link:

http://www.diabetes.org/enews/052401_CVD.asp



3. Study Finds That Diabetes Doubles Risk for Depression

Diabetes patients are twice as likely to suffer from depression as those
who do not have diabetes, according to a new study to be published in
the June issue of Diabetes Care. Conducted jointly by researchers at the
Washington University School of Medicine and the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri, the study is the first to
provide a firm estimate of how likely patients are to suffer from both
depression and diabetes. For more information on this story, click on
the following link:

4. ADA Helps Lead Cardiovascular Program in Atlanta

The Cardiovascular Learning Partnership (CLP), an organization made up
of the American Diabetes Association and four other national
non-profits, is using a $750,000 grant by the Guidant Foundation to fund
an education and outreach program for Atlanta African Americans with
diabetes and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The program,
consisting of an awareness campaign and a multi-site clinical project,
aims to empower African American diabetes patients to secure proper CVD
interventions, and to give health professionals better tools to provide
the highest quality of care. For more information on this story, click
on the following link:

IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Increase Means More General Practitioner Involvement
Due to its alarming increase in prevalence in the last twenty years,
diabetes has gone from a "secondary care" or specialty issue to being a
condition in which every primary care physician must be competent to
diagnose and manage.  This article from Pulse recognizes the need for
general practice physicians to expand their diabetes resources and
become more aggressive in diagnosis and treatment.

http://ada.yellowbrix.com/pages/ada/Story.nsp?story_id=24560325&ID=ada

Lifestyle Remains Key Diabetes Risk
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine reevaluated the
landmark 1980-1996 Nurses Health Study, in which nearly 85,000 female
nurses aged 30 to 55 were regularly monitored for dietary intake,
smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  Diabetes was
newly identified in 3,300 subjects in the study.  Lack of exercise, a
poor diet and current smoking were all associated with a significantly
increased risk of diabetes.

Childhood Obesity Becoming Global Problem
Childhood obesity in the United States has grown to epidemic levels, say
public health officials.  Now, a recent study led by researchers at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill finds that growing numbers
of young people in China and Russia are also overweight and obese.

Native American Conference Suggests Traditional Lifestyles
According to the U.S. Indian Health Service, there were very few, if
any, known cases of diabetes among Native Americans before 1936.
However, today Native Americans have the highest incidence of any ethnic
group for type 2 diabetes. Earlier this week in Tulsa, OK delegates from
40 Native American tribes, representatives from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and various
health professionals attended the "Return to Your Roots" conference to
examine ways to combat this troubling public health program.  Much of
the conference focused on adopting traditional Native American lifestyle
habits as a means to improve their health.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

R&R...

It's that time of year again...Thanksgiving.  And with it comes the
beginning of another festive holiday season. During this hectic time,
you'll tend to do things that are out of your normal routine: shopping
at the mall for hours on end, snacking in-between meals, eating out and
traveling.  This crazy schedule can often affect you and your blood
sugar - sometimes you may not even realize it.  The ADA has resources
that can help.

TRAVEL...
Wouldn't it be great if someone made your packing lists and wrote down
all the things you need to do before you travel? Well, someone has.
Check out the ADA's The Diabetes Travel Guide, by clicking here:

SNACKING...
Ever feel like everyone can eat junk food but you?  Finally, a
collection of snack recipes for people with diabetes! The Diabetes
Snack, Munch, Nibble, and Nosh Book features snack ideas for parties and
crowds that are diabetes-friendly. Now even YOU can enjoy festive food
items such as chili con queso, chips and black bean salsa, pesto, and
muffins.  To learn more about this book, click here:

IN THE NEWS...
New Federal Initiative to Focus on Diabetes and Women
Of the estimated 16 million Americans with diabetes, more than half are women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The CDC recently launched its new three-phased initiative on women and diabetes.  The initiative, co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association,  the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), will work to curb the recent rise in diabetes among women.

Eat Your Way to Better Health
The American Diabetes Association released new nutritional guidelines in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research.  The new guidelines emphasize recent evidence that exercise and lifestyle choices can play major roles in managing and even preventing diabetes.  Other interesting studies in the January issue include research on how stress management can affect blood sugar and the annual costs diabetes expenses cost employers.

Overfeeding Rapidly Induces Leptin and Insulin Resistance
Hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia coexist in common forms of obesity. A team of researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, recently demonstrated that overfeeding mice induces leptin and insulin resistance in test subjects.  The study, led by Dr. Luciano Rossetti, was published in the December, 2001 issue of the journal Diabetes.

A Few Sips a Day Could Cut Heart Disease Risk
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently found that men with type 2 diabetes who consume moderate amounts of alcohol each day reduce their risk of heart disease.  Compared with nondrinkers, men who drank one-half to two drinks daily cut their heart disease risk by 36 percent, and men who drank more than two drinks a day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart problems.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

IN THE NEWS...
Many Adults Have Obesity Syndrome
A recent study from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 47 million Americans - more than one in five - have the cluster of health problems known as metabolic syndrome.  This condition, thought to be caused by a combination of genes and lifestyle factors, such as overeating and lack of exercise, includes heaviness around the waist, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol readings and elevated blood sugar.  Metabolic syndrome greatly increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

One Step Closer to a Cure
In Type 1 diabetes, which occurs in nearly one million Americans, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, stopping insulin production and wreaking havoc on blood sugar levels.  For this reason, people with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin to themselves on a carefully controlled basis. Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently found that in mice, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas can regenerate themselves, giving hope that this new method of fighting the disease could draw science closer to a cure.

Aspirin Therapy for Hearts Defended
Aspirin has long been the basis of blood thinning treatment for people with cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke.  It is not, however, usually prescribed for those that have conditions that put them at risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels and chest pain.  Recent research could change this.  A report from Oxford University in England shows that small doses of aspirin (75-100 milligrams per day) significantly lower the risk of heart attack or stroke for those at high risk due to related conditions.

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Bill:

Please deploy the following local.env file into TDS stage. It will connect to sitstge instead of sitpara, so we can complete the dealcapture to CPR to positions loop.
(We cannot use sitpara because we cannot create deals into the production instance sitpara points to.)

 
Thanks

IN THE NEWS...
Medicare Funds Nutritional Therapy
On January 1, 2002, Medicare began covering medical nutritional therapy for many recipients with diabetes and kidney diseases. With this new benefit, around 4.5 million Medicare recipients with diabetes and an estimated 110,000 with kidney disease are eligible for medical nutritional therapy aimed at helping them learn to make healthy eating choices and better manage their conditions.  The comments of Anne Daly, the Association's President, Health Care & Education, are featured in this article from The Washington Post covering the new benefit.

FDA Approves Generic Metformin
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted approval to eleven generic drug manufacturers to market generic versions of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's popular diabetes medication Glucophage (metformin).  Glucophage is taken orally in pill form, and is currently the world's top-selling diabetes medication. The drug reduces blood sugar levels by curbing production of glucose by the liver.

Sexual Problems in Men With Diabetes, and More from Diabetes Care
According to a study published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research, more than one-third of adult men with diabetes experience sexual dysfunction.  Also in the February issue, a separate study shows that a particular type of weight-loss surgery can dramatically improve the health of severely obese people with diabetes, and in some cases even send the disease into remission.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

will have access to new options and personalized features tailored to meet =
your travel needs. In order to make this transition, we ask that you carefu=
lly review and follow the suggestions listed below.   Here's What You Need =
To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, including your username (g=
storey) and password, has been transferred to the new version of eService O=
nline. To protect your personal information, credit card information has no=
t been transferred. You will need to update your profile.  Your Itineraries=
 Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not=
 be transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them =
prior to 6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any =
reservations and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eServic=
e Online.   Signing In To enhance security, you will have to sign in for ea=
ch transaction session to reserve and purchase flights.  This means you wil=
l have to use your password each time.  To have your password e-mailed to y=

 the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold Option To prepare for next We=
dnesday's release, we will turn off the "Hold for 24 hours" option. The "Ho=
ld" option will not be available between May 25 and May 30.   Here Are Some=
 of the Changes  More eTicketing The new eService Online offers expanded op=
portunities for electronic tickets (eTickets). We can now provide eTickets =
for code share flights operated by Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink =
(CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps=
 We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the =
seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.    Prici=
ng  The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on y=
our selection of either "Search By Lowest Fares" or "Search By Schedule." W=
e also added a gold star to denote "continental.com promotional fares," so =
you know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.   =
 Customer Service  Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Cont=
inental employees now handle all support for online inquiries and reservati=
ons services.  While we've made a number of improvements to the overall exp=
erience, this new version may not, on the surface, appear to be significant=
ly different.  These changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilitie=
s we have planned for the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions=
 as we move ahead.  Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work=
 adding enhancements.  We're confident you will appreciate the changes and =

Patrice/Geoff, How do you guys want to handle the contract with this customer?  Will he stay on ENA paper or do we, EES, send him a new contract?  I need these answers today because the customer will be moved an EES pool today for June 1.

I would also like to see the contract you guys have with them so I can understand what obligations I would owe them.

Thanks,
Jesus

?	Click the following link to open eHRonline:  https://ehronline.enron.com 
?	Read the disclaimer
?	Click Accept
?	Type your SAP Logon ID (e.g. your "P" ID) in the User Id field.
?	Enter your SAP password in the Password field.
?	Click the Logon button.
?	Select Paycheck Inquiry from the drop-down list
?	Click the radio button next to Results in Period to select the default for the May 31, 2001 pay advice

Hi,

Would someone please amend BV Mabanaft (CP ID above)  to read Mabanaft BV within GCP so that the feeds into other systems receive the client name correctly.

Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you require further information.

Regards,

Debbie

Hey guys,

Less than two weeks now...

Just wanted to find out when everyone would be arriving.

they want us to pick up the tuxes and pay for everything on Thursday
evening.  I know some of you won't be in until Friday, so we'll work around
that.  The shop is also in the city, so we may have to try and move to one
of the shops in the burbs if you all are headed out there.  Let me know when
you'll be available and I'll figure it out for the group.

Later,

Jason

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Geoff,
	I am e-mailing you about your h:\ drive.  You are currently using almost 2.1gb of disk space on your h:\ drive.  Can you please go through this and try and clean up as much as possible.  We really don't have the space available to store that amount of data per user on the h:\ drives.  

If there are data files that are being stored on your h:\ drive, for projects or other Enron related businesses, these can be stored on o:\ drive.


Please contact me if you have any questions at x56389

Thanks

  When a deal is killed in CPR, the detail record gets deleted. Consequently, when CPRReader picks up the change, it has no idea what the start and end dates for the record are, and doesn't publish anything for those values. When Deal Ticker gets the deal, it uses the "0" date, Dec 30, 1899 for the start and end dates.

Possible fixes would include having Deal Ticker just not display dates when they're not known, or having the CPR triggers put the start and end dates in the TDS table when a deal is killed.

IN THE NEWS...
Diabetes Care Not Linked to Learning Problems
Researchers at the University of Iowa have good news for children with type 1 diabetes.  A recent study conducted there found that children with type 1 diabetes do not experience any learning problems from their diabetes treatments.  The findings, which counter earlier research linking diabetes treatment to learning troubles, appear in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.

Managing Stress Could Help Control Blood Sugar
Stress has often been associated with elevated blood sugar in people with diabetes, but until now, there have been no large clinical studies exploring how stress management therapy might help people with the disease control their blood sugar.  New research reported by Richard Surwit, PhD., and a team from the Duke University Medical Center, found that people with type 2 diabetes that incorporate stress management into their daily lives can significantly improve blood sugar control.  The study was published in the January, 2002 issue of Diabetes Care.

Mothers Who Smoke Could Create Diabetes Risk
Recent research from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden finds another reason for people not to smoke.  The children of women who smoke during pregnancy could be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life, according to the new study published in this month's British Medical Journal.

Florida Newborns Offered Diabetes Screening
Florida will soon be the first U.S. state to offer every newborn a chance to be screened for risk of type 1 diabetes. A voluntary program funded by a $10 million endowment created by the American Diabetes Association, the new initiative will identify babies at high risk for the disease and continue to monitor them throughout their lives.  The program will be based at the University of Florida College of Medicine and become available within 1 1/2 years.

Mary Jo:
Per our conversation below, could you take a quick look at the data below and see if Varn International is a company we can work with?

Thanks.


Believe it or not, I am currently working in the Northwest side of Houston  
with Varn International.  Our parent company, Day International,  has  
facilities located in Michigan and North Carolina.   Would you be so kind and  
point me in the right direction as to who might handle the Carolina Power and  
Light account in Ashville, NC as well as the American Electric Power account  
in Three Rivers Michigan.  Our Day plants have been using brokers but I  
thought we might could work with Enron, if they are in that market area, and  
possibly negotiate some long term agreement for all our facilities.  Once  
they found out I had natural gas experience, they put me on this project.   
Otherwise I'm responsible for purchasing and logistics for North America and  
eventually worldwide.

R&R...

It's that time of year again...Thanksgiving.  And with it comes the
beginning of another festive holiday season. During this hectic time,
you'll tend to do things that are out of your normal routine: shopping
at the mall for hours on end, snacking in-between meals, eating out and
traveling.  This crazy schedule can often affect you and your blood
sugar - sometimes you may not even realize it.  The ADA has resources
that can help.

TRAVEL...
Wouldn't it be great if someone made your packing lists and wrote down
all the things you need to do before you travel? Well, someone has.
Check out the ADA's The Diabetes Travel Guide, by clicking here:

SNACKING...
Ever feel like everyone can eat junk food but you?  Finally, a
collection of snack recipes for people with diabetes! The Diabetes
Snack, Munch, Nibble, and Nosh Book features snack ideas for parties and
crowds that are diabetes-friendly. Now even YOU can enjoy festive food
items such as chili con queso, chips and black bean salsa, pesto, and
muffins.
