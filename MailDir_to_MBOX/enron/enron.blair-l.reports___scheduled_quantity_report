John/Terry/Raetta/Larry,

OGE and Aquila use the month to date volumes on the schedule volume reports. I also use them to send to Mark Walden for the NNG Admin. contract every month. If the report needs to be different for some reason can the old one be put back in place for those of us that use it regularly? I hope consideration is given to reinstating the former contents of this report. It sounds like there are several people (both external and internal) who would like to be able to access the data that used to appear on the scheduled quantities reports. 

Just giving some extra feedback on the subject!

thanks,
Chris G

This is currently under discussion but no decision has been made yet, try and work with the customer with the new report.

I have two questions about the Service Requester Scheduled Quantity report
that came on line this week:

1.  Does it have to be legal size?  The previous report was very readable
and it was 8 1/2 x 11, landscape

2.  This report gives no month-to-date totals and now I have to get two
reports on each pipeline every day in order to reconcile our system
correctly.  Is there any way the first page of the old report could be added
to this report so that month-to-date totals can be seen?

John, Please don't kill the messenger, but Lamar Power called along with CMS Marketing today asking that the Scheduled Quantities Report please be reinstated.  This report included receipt and delivery volumes, a summary, as well as, Month to date information. The new report gives them very little to work with and a lot of information they don't need on this report.

Cinergy's Paulette, who handles NNG, and Belinda, who handles TWPL, have just telephoned to ask what happened to these reports -- they use them to monitor month to date totals, distributions, and third party package information.  They are begging for the reports to return.

Brooks uses these for documentation as well for all of their agencies.  (TransCanada).

Thanks,
S.
