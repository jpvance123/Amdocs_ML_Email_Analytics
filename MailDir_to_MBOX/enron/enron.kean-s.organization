Can you circulate the attached chart to Government Affairs staff.  The

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =
the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=
ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=
 to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=
 changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=
he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=
y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=
his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =
that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=
sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=
 by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=
ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =
very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =
not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=
k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =
shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=
 have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=
 are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =
me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=
ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =
ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=
d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =
U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =
Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=
ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =
the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=
elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=
dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=
ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =
be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=
st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=
n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=
 of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =
development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=
 a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=
islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=
ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=
 will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=
elopment efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=
nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =
taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=
m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=
tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=
pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=
s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=
 to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=
 affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=
h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=
, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =
to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=
ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=
 Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=
, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=
tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=
erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=
ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =
Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=
.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=
ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=
pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=
e future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =
this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=
 the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=
oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=
r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=
or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=
nce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =
all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=
y best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =
appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

This is from the Business Week web site.  Story in the magazine will be very similar.  I'm am trying to correct the "interim CEO" wording in the sub-head of the Q&A with Ken.

In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

?	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

?	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

?	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

?	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

?	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

?	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

As part of Enron Industrial Market's (EIM) move into the Pulp, Paper and

that market effectively. Accordingly, we are pleased to announce that Bruce 
Garner has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Enron 
Industrial Markets - Europe. In this role, Bruce will be responsible for all 
activities for EIM in the European market.

Please join us in congratulating Bruce in his new position.

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20
Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20

Attached is a copy of the new floor plan for 47, as well as a list of the 
seating assignments as approved by senior management.  The construction is 
scheduled to be completed on February 9, and we'll be able to effect our 
moves the following Monday, February 12.  

The move paperwork will be handled as one complete request.  You may be 
contacted for your social security number, current location, etc. if we don't 
already have that information.

On another note, a couple of people have voiced complaints about the air 
quality on the 47th floor.  The air filters have been replaced with high 
density, thicker filters which should make a significant improvement.  The 
Facilities group will also perform some additional testing to check our air 
quality.

If you'll be out of the office on Monday and need help getting your desk 
packed, please let Elizabeth know by Thursday, 2/8.  

Please call her at x33896 if you have any questions.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

The current directors of Facility Audits, Chuck Goode and Steve Allen, will report to Mike and will be responsible for leading the corporate asset operations audits.  Technical experts from business unit operations and engineering will continue to serve on the multidisciplinary audit teams.   Audit responsibility for ETS assets will remain in ETS.

We are pleased to announce the latest addition to the Corporate Benefits Team and clarify the roles of my direct reports.

Chris Rahaim accepted the position of Director of Benefits and joined Enron on August 6, 2001.  Chris comes to Enron from Entergy in New Orleans and has welcomed expertise in the area of Mergers and Acquisitions.  Chris recently obtained his law degree from Loyola University and has relocated his wife and 2-year old son to the Houston area.

Chris will oversee the day-to-day operations and management of the Health & Wellness, Pension and Savings Plans.  He will also function as the point person for benefits-related issues due to any upcoming or transitional mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.

Maryann Roman de Mezza has added management of the Health and Wellness Plans to her current role as the Director of Wellness.  Maryann brings her unique and extensive expertise of disease and vendor management to this area in a further effort to integrate Wellness programs with management of illnesses reported.  Maryann will report to Chris Rahaim.

Mikie Rath will concentrate on special projects, HR Commercialization efforts and employee benefit communication.

Sandy Huseman will concentrate on benefits accounting and return on investments for any plan design changes and implementations.  She will continue to provide guidance for the Health & Wellness team.

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

David: I thank you. You cannot imagine how appreciated this is. The changes 
come so fast at Enron that unless you are associated with the organization 
concerned, it's impossible to get timely information into the hands of those 
in positions of responsibility. Joe

=09I know you are getting an impossible volume of advice right now . . .  b=
ut that's not going to stop me from piling on a little more.

=09I believe everything we have been saying: we have the best business mode=
l, we are making great money, we are growing, we are addressing our issues =
and we have all of our capabilities intact.  We are poised for even greater=
 growth.  Even so, we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st=
ock and on our reputation right now.  Our problem is not a problem about ge=
tting the message out. =20

=09Part of the problem we can't do anything about:  almost all equities hav=
e suffered this year.  But part of our problem (the part we can do somethin=
g about) is that we are faced with too many bad, but true (or at least plau=
sible), allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our=
 story.  These current circumstances are not necessarily bad:  I think we c=
an use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes.  But no a=
mount of communication or "spin" will work right now.  We have to directly =
address the issues.=20

=09The difficult allegations we face include:

Creative or aggressive accounting (both in reporting and deal structuring);
Black box reporting;
Over-hyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses;
A near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems (u=
ntil those problems have become very big), discourages cooperation and team=
work, and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th=
eir work environment.

=09I have some answers.  First, I would hold our actions to the standard we=
 apply to everything else:  the market standard.  We should do the economic=
ally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal=
l where they may.  Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn=
ings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because it's on the books for=
 more than the market, we should just make the rational economic decision. =
=20

=09Second, I would open up our reporting.  Make it as transparent as the an=
alysts want; indeed, set a new standard for transparency and integrity.  I =
know we are looking at these things and have been for some time.  I also re=
alize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions.  I'm =
just saying we should drive right up to the edge. =20

=09Third, I think IR should be all about the facts: disclosing facts and co=
rrecting misunderstandings.  I would not "spin" in this function.  Our audi=
ence is too sophisticated.  If we make the economically rational decisions =
over and over, the stock price will come along.  We have lost credibility b=
y overhyping businesses we haven't proven yet and it's hard to see why we d=
o it.  To get early credit in the stock price?  I'd rather wait.  To prove =
that we are a growth company?  I think a track record of growth and a ratio=
nal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that.=
  I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves, not in its=
 approach to analysts or in its accounting.  The reputation I would like to=
 have with investors is that we never overstate, we never dissappoint and t=
hat we can always be trusted.  I am not being critical of our team.  We hav=
e the best, most organized, hardest working, and most effective IR team in =
the business.  I am just concerned that we have sent them speeding down the=
 wrong path.  Similarly, I am not critical of our accounting organization. =
 We have the finest accounting organization in the industry.  They need to =
be the best in order to get sensible accounting rules and interpretations t=
o accurately reflect the results of our unique and innovative business.  Th=
ey need to minimize our tax exposures etc.  I am not arguing that anyone ha=
s done anything wrong or ineffectively.  I simply believe that it is time t=
o reassess how we do these things (and I don't consider my organization to =
be exempt from that same reassessment).

=09Finally, our culture.  As I said the other day, there may be a relativel=
y small number of individuals who are commercially successful, well paid, r=
egularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe=
r human beings in general.  When others see them rewarded, it matters not a=
t all what we say about our values.  Dealing with a few people directly wil=
l send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization.  Addi=
tionally, compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward=
s teamwork (and which includes broader representation than just the commerc=
ial groups) will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i=
n the organization.

=09I hope it's clear to you that I love this place.  I have poured my heart=
 and soul into it.  It is the finest organization I have ever been part of.=
  Like everyone, I have had some time to reflect lately.  I have recommitte=
d myself to this place and to your leadership.  Part of that recommitment w=
ill be my concerted effort to make things even better.
