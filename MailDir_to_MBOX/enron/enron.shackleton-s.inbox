Mary and Sara,

Attached is a schedule I set up to track wires which I have sent out from the Prime Brokers since October 25th.  

For non Equity Trading areas, we contacted them to say we wanted to sent money back, got their approval and re-affirmed wiring instructions.

Treasury was contacted when the money was coming in and to what account.

Please do not hesitate to call if you have questions.  I can provide copies of any wire requests you would like.  

Sheila

Alan:  We need Ed Smida's help with prioritizing the EGM in-the-money requests from Beth Apollo's group.  Beth is only focused on physical gas and power appearing on Don Miller's list.  Ed S. can really help me and PWC in bringing a small but discrete number of EGM parties to the top of the list.

ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara

We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.

In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
We are okay with this. 

They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.

Please call me if I can be of assistance.

Thanks, Sheila

Sheila,

We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

(See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)

Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.

Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

I doubt it as I do not believe any margin calls have been made since our filing; Monica should confirm this.  Unfortunately, we do not have clarity on the valuations, thus we do not know if we are truly entitled to continue to hold the LCs. We can always call for a renewal assuming the same exposures and wait for them to dispute it.

Dear Member:

As you may be aware, Senator Feinstein has proposed an amendment to the
Senate energy bill. The amendment seeks to redress some serious regulatory
gaps which are significant to the energy and metals marketplaces:

1)	the differential treatment of electronically traded energy and
metals futures
2)	the inability to get critically needed information from
over-the-counter (OTC) market operators

The New York Mercantile Exchange is supporting the Feinstein amendment. We
want to explain our  reasons.

Electronic trading systems offering traditional over-the-counter products
for energy and metals trading are currently exempt from any regulation. The
CFTC is without jurisdiction to oversee fair play, or to examine records,
establish standards and deter misconduct as occurs on a traditional exchange
like NYMEX.

As these systems have gained importance in the price discovery process for
many instruments, and as they are accepted as centralized marketplaces by
the customers using them, we find the exemption from regulation of the
platforms and their operators to be troubling.

The Feinstein amendment is aimed squarely at the system operators, who take
on the role of operators of a central marketplace. The amendment does not
seek to impose restrictions on where OTC market participants might trade but
provides some limited record keeping requirements, which are more than
likely already part of their daily business. Instead, the amendment seeks to
create a duty for system operators to report to the CFTC and be subject to
the "Regulatory Lite" scheme set forth in the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act.

Imagine a situation where a large market participant held a substantial
volume of crude oil in private storage, and then leased Cushing pipeline
capacity for its own use or to move additional oil into storage. Market
demand could be unmet by this company, and the ability of others to meet it
could be frustrated, thus driving the price up. Suppose this company held a
large long position on an over the counter system, and profited handsomely
from this conduct. Would you really want that market user to be able to hide
behind the unregulated status of the platform where those trades occurred to
impede investigation? Is that the type of deterrent to misconduct that the
industry wants? We do not think so.

We urge you to notify Senator Feinstein and the bill's co-sponsor, Senator
Fitzgerald of your support. Contact information is as follows:

Senator Dianne Feinstein
Contact Warren Weinstein
202-224-3841   fax 228-3954

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

Also, we are still pending an okay from Donna Lowry.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

I'm getting my head above water WRT the demand letters we sent in early March and all the associated fallout from those letters.  Preparing for our next move to bring in more cash.  We can send more demand letters for Mar02 non-paid invoices (don't know yet how many there are) and/or pursue default interest payments associated w/ the previous demand letter payments.

Sara and Angelo, let's get together to plot out our next actions.  I'll set up a meeting.

Bill and Ed:

Here's an update:

- Enserco Energy has renewed their LC.  I should be getting a faxed copy shortly and bill will receive the original.
- Kim Theriot confirmed that there are no outstanding trades with Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company.
- Leslie Reeves confirmed that there are no outstanding amounts due by Metromedia Energy.  Has anyone found the LC?  I have asked Kim T. to locate the trade docs.
- Leslie Reeves confirmed that The Energy Authority closed out their positions with ENA.
- Energy Production Corp.'s LC automatically renews  for 1 year periods unless we received a notice from Chase of its intention not to renew 90 days prior to expiration.

Is all of this info consistent with credit's records?

That leaves Niagra Mohawk Energy Marketing, El Paso Electric, Rising Star Energy LLC and LG&E Energy Marketing.  Out of those CP's, only LG&E owes us a payment.  I am waiting to hear back from Leslie regarding payments owed by Niagra and Rising Star.   I have asked Kim to sends me the trading docs from Niagra.


Alan Aronowitz is working with someone in credit or settlements on the Vitol LC.

Sara and Marie,
Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.  

MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.

As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.

Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.

Please advise.
Sheila

Sara and Marie,
CSFB Europe requires information to open an account.  We have an account with CSFB Corporation - NY. Would you please review their requirements?  Do we have a problem with any of them?

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.  I will get Robert Daborn's telephone number.
Thanks,

SG,

I called CSFB (Robert Daborn CSFB Compliance) yesterday because they issued yet another confirm in the name of ECT Investments PLC and not ECT Inv Inc. (We thought this matter had been resolved on their side but apparently not).

Below I have attached an email that I received from Robert.  The email contains a word document that requires an authorized Enron person's signature.

Please let me know if I can do anything from this side to resolve this matter.

Many thanks

Kimberly,

Further to our conversation of earlier today it would appear that trades
have been incorrectly allocated to an existing Enron account. This existing
account has been opened with CSFB for several years and it may well be the
case that it is the correct entity for certain transactions between our two
corporations.

However, I note that for transactions executed by yourself the correct
booking entity should be ETC Investments Inc (ETC). Whilst ETC is an
existing client of CSFB Corporation - NY it is not currently set up as a
client of CSFB Equities / CSFB Europe Ltd.

In order that your account can be set up and trades booked correctly I would
appreciate it if you could provide CSFB with following information:

1) Confirmation that ETC is a wholly / majority owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp. This can be evidenced by providing CSFB with a copy of Enron's Annual
Report / Audited Financial Statement and Accounts or confirmed in writing by
Enron on Enron letterhead  

2) Confirmation of the registered address of ETC

3) Completed and signed authorisation document attached below.

The information requested above is required to meet our UK Regulatory &
Legal obligations and is not to my knowledge retained by our New York
office.

Please accept my apologies for any delay you've experienced in resolving
this issue but by providing the information requested we should be in a
position to make the requisite changes.

Kind Regards

Rob Daborn

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.


Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

Is there a way to identify outstanding financial/physical positions with respect to these products?

I'd like to cross check to see which counterparties have sent termination notices.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new "Morning Briefing" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

EES Business Center 
The Business Center is ready to receive and track all customer leads and service issues. EES needs a single point of entry for all customer calls and issues to ensure customer satisfaction. Starting today, please route all general inquiry calls to our Business Center to provide each customer with consistent and effective assistance.

In the event that an account, partner, utility or vendor's activity affects EES' interests, an URGENT ISSUE request should be filed immediately. Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Mary/ Sara, 
 
Morgan Stanley has proposed a few changes to the confirm that was executed last year. These changes are all in blue and most of these seem to be legal in nature. The number of barrels and the payments dates need to be changed. 
 

I am also sending the Morgan Stanley confirm circulated by you yesterday to Beth Ng at Morgan Stanley and asking her to have a look at its acceptability in order to speed up the process. 

Could you also liaise with Beth, so that we arrive at an agreeable confirm by close of business today? Beth's card is enclosed for this purpose. 
As an alternative (if we can't come to an agreeable format), could you please take a look at the MS confirms sent by MS and see whether it is acceptable to us? 

 
Thanks very much & Regards

Dear Chris: 

David Morgan of our London Desk has forwarded for my review your proposed form of Confirmation. 

Attached you will find the Confirmation marked with our proposed modifications.   Please be mindful that I have not looked at any of the commercial elements of the proposed Transaction.   I will leave this review for our trading desk.   Our suggested modifications are highlighted in blue.   Our specific comments are as follows: 

1.    Second paragraph.  The reference to "Rights of Third Party" was deleted because the transaction will be between U.S. parties and the Agreement is governed under the laws of the State of New York.    Rights of Third Party has no relevance. 

2.    Third paragraph.   We have added this paragraph because the Agreement between MSCGI and Enron North America is a non-ISDA.  We have noted that some of the terms in the Confirmation definitions from ISDA. 

3.    Fourth paragraph.   I believe you want to insert a "non-reliance" provision in this Confirmation.   I have included some additional elements to "non-reliance".  Alternatively, we can insert the "No Reliance" provision as suggested by ISDA. 

I am working with Susan Bailey of your Houston office to update the current master agreement to an ISDA Master Agreement.  Hopefully, in the very near future, we will have an ISDA to govern our relationship. 

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. 

Kind regards,

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

I've learned that there is a netting agreement with FPL, on their form.  Only ENA signed it, although it attempts to include all commodities.  

This netting agreement doesn't show up on the master netting list, so I thought I would mention it.

CSFB Europe requires information to open an account.  We have an account with CSFB Corporation - NY. Would you please review their requirements?  Do we have a problem with any of them?

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.  I will get Robert Daborn's telephone number.

SG,

I called CSFB (Robert Daborn CSFB Compliance) yesterday because they issued yet another confirm in the name of ECT Investments PLC and not ECT Inv Inc. (We thought this matter had been resolved on their side but apparently not).

Below I have attached an email that I received from Robert.  The email contains a word document that requires an authorized Enron person's signature.

Please let me know if I can do anything from this side to resolve this matter.

Many thanks
Kimberly

Kimberly,

Further to our conversation of earlier today it would appear that trades
have been incorrectly allocated to an existing Enron account. This existing
account has been opened with CSFB for several years and it may well be the
case that it is the correct entity for certain transactions between our two
corporations.

However, I note that for transactions executed by yourself the correct
booking entity should be ETC Investments Inc (ETC). Whilst ETC is an
existing client of CSFB Corporation - NY it is not currently set up as a
client of CSFB Equities / CSFB Europe Ltd.

In order that your account can be set up and trades booked correctly I would
appreciate it if you could provide CSFB with following information:

1) Confirmation that ETC is a wholly / majority owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp. This can be evidenced by providing CSFB with a copy of Enron's Annual
Report / Audited Financial Statement and Accounts or confirmed in writing by
Enron on Enron letterhead  

2) Confirmation of the registered address of ETC

3) Completed and signed authorisation document attached below.

The information requested above is required to meet our UK Regulatory &
Legal obligations and is not to my knowledge retained by our New York
office.

Please accept my apologies for any delay you've experienced in resolving
this issue but by providing the information requested we should be in a
position to make the requisite changes.

Kind Regards

Rob Daborn

The files belonging to Brent Hendry should contain the information regarding the SMUD transaction.

I would appreciate access to these files to build a file for the weather desk as we don't have records for this transaction.

Also, could you also please cc Mark Tawney and myself on correspondence regarding the weather desk so that we remain informed and can assist where necessary.

We have a situation in Mexico that we need to address fairly soon.  In a nutshell, we were negotiating a master with this counterpartty for a long time and at a certain point we (with credit approval) entered into a transaction and a day later we agreed on the final terms of the Master.  We sent them final execution copies in one day and Enron filed for bankruptcy 2 days later.  They never signed the docs and we never confirmed the transaction because we were waiting for the master.  They now do not want to send us an execution copy of the master because it provides for automatic early termination.  I will stop by your office to discuss.

I will be talking with this counterparty tomorrow to propose some solution but would like to have your views before talking to them.  WE are about US$1MM in the money with these people.

Thanks

Bryan,

On December 13, 2001, ACE Financial Services sent Jeff Kinneman, Enron North America Corp, a advisory that the Credit Derivative Transaction was under review and may be terminated.  

I forwarded a copy onto M. Heard, S. Shackleton and A. Aronowitz and faxed a copy to both you and Simon on December 14, 2001.

Please advise how Enron Credit is dealing with this transaction.

Thanks. Sheila

Bryan,

Deuthsche Bank served a credit notice to ECT Investments Inc. for the "triplets" trade.  This trade is not ECT Investments Inc.'s.  All the Credit business was transferred to Enron North America on November 2000 and the Credit book was transferred to Enron Credit Inc. in February 2001.  This trade should not be in ECT Investments Inc.'s name and should have been transferred by Enron Credit.

I would expect Enron Credit Inc. to settle the financial liablility of this trade and not leave it as an obligation to ECT Investments, Inc.

My understanding is that the obligation is around $800,000.

Please advise.

Regards,
Sheila

Sara and Marie,

Yesterday we moved positions from several futures brokers to Fimat Derivatives Canada.  We had an account there previously, A/C # K2300.

They are requesting account documentation forms be signed today because our prior account with them was under HSBC and they want to get it directly in the name of Enron North America.

They are e-mailing account forms to me today and I will forward to both of you as soon as I receive.

Gary and Jeff Shankman requested that we move positions to FIMAT.

Sheila

Elizabeth: You had mentioned in your transition memo/list that Sempra had agreed to a termination, and that there was a dispute on the return of our collateral. I do not see them on the list. Could you advise further on this?

Thanks, Alan

Selena-

I got your voicemail.  I'm glad you've decided to subscribe to the insurance
module.

I've attached the quote for services document for your signature.  I left
the terms the same as we agreed for the original subscription - No more than
10% increase for second year renewal and quarterly billing.  The Master
Subscription Agreement will be the same, too.  Cheryl Nelson in your legal
department already has a copy.

I did extend the trial until next Friday so that will be the invoice date
even if you return the signed copy before then.

Thanks and regards,

Ellen

Sara,

Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented.
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the
termination notice would not be effective.

We propose to insert the following language instead:


	"Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts
to
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party,
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile
transmission."

     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under
"Additional
     Termination Event".)

Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round
of signatures.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Christine

RAC is correct, we no longer have a Line of Credit with Paribas.  I may have misspoken Friday.  We paid off the balance on 11/8 ($30MM at the time) and IM has since increased to $54MM.

Problem is that if Harvard does a deal with ENA and ENA back-to-backs it withe ECTRIC, we lose it from an exposure perspective. ENA probably never records the deal since it has a closed position. Then ECTRIC thinks it has a position with ENA so we lose the third party exposure.  The simple answer, I think, is if they want to trade Brent on EOL, then they probably need an ECTRIC ISDA since ENA cannot trade Brent on EOL, right?

Tanya:

Apparantly, Presidents & Fellows of Harvard wants to trade on EOL.  They were given a long-term guest ID that has since been closed out.  However, they still want to do these Brent deals and have them booked back-to-back so that they are under the ISDA with ENA.  Two things:

1)	We do not show the ISDA in CAS
?	$20MM Threshold
?	Executed as of 11/20/00
2)	Shouldn't the Brent deals that were booked back-to-back with ECTRIC be showing up in CAS, given that the purpose of this action was to bring the exposure under the ISDA?
?	Deal #s:	QP4223 and VA0834

Are we still ok with doing this back-to-back booking?  Also, how do we feel about this entity trading Metals (or should they even be trading Metals)?

The below email is from Rod to Sara in relationship to this whole issue.  I will be out tomorrow, but I told Sara today that I would be running this by you to see what your thoughts were on the issue.  Thanks for your help!  Would you let me know of the outcome.

Hi Sara.  This issue comes up fairly often.  My understanding is that Brent deals are automatically booked to ECTRIC for tax reasons.  The Brent product stack is managed here in London by folks who live, work and eat in the UK.  Since they are in effect generating earnings for the firm 'in' the UK, the tax argument is that the Inland Revenue should collect tax on this amount.  We could book to ENA, but I here that this could cause double taxation (being taxed again by the IRS).  Perhaps ECTRIC could do a back-to-back trade with ENA at the Brent mid price - thus still managing the product in the UK but generating no UK earnings (Inland Revenue may call foul though).

Having said this, we have successfully re-booked in the past when trades were done on the phone (apparently without tax consequence).  No one has taken a hard stand on the above - that I know of anyway.  I would recommend just telling the book admin to rebook to ENA and see if we get any resistance.  Clearly, from a credit perspective we would much prefer to book both legs at ENA.

Hope all else is going well.

Rod

Hey, Rod (the "Dude"):

Mr. Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you.
I spoke with Harvard (has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement (the "Master") in place) who is trading on EOL (and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master).  Harvard executed a crude/Brent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC (and not ENA).  Boy, were they surprised!  

Harvard's request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA.  Then, all of Harvard's trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted.

Is this a commercial issue?  Does ENA need a "Brent book" to receive this trade? 

An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an "accommodation" to Harvard.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

P.S.  I never made it to London in June.  My boyfriend's mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later.  My mother died a few weeks ago.  It's been a bad summer.  But, I'm taking a vacation from August 23 - 31 and will be in London (staying at the Ritz).  Maybe we can have that drink!

Since we haven't been able to get the ISDA they have yet to trade with us - this will hopefully let us compete for the business, so any trading is better than before. Thanks for the attention.

Sara - let me know what to do next - wait for you to finish the new draft?

Sara!

We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.

Richard!

In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.

Sara,

I sent you an invitiation to a meeting earlier today and noticed that I scheduled it for last Saturday; my apologies.  Anyway, Louis and I are trying to get together with you and Alan Aronowitz to get up to speed on the status of Live CP's that were sent Demand Letters and to begin determining a process for moving ahead with terminated CP's.

We are able to meet in your building at whatever time works best for yours and Alan's schedules.

According to one of our brokers, NYMEX raised ENE margins by another 200%.  I have not seen any documentation because I am stuck in jury duty but jst wanted to keep you informed.

If CSFB cannot locate the document, doesn't that indicate a problem in of itself.  When we last spoke, you were going to coordinate obtaining the account documents from your brokers and have all the changes that Enron dictated to the brokers reflected on the new account application for Enron Credit Inc.  In the last email that went out it said "we should send both ENA and ECI doc to compare".  Who is going to send the documents to CSFB?  I assume you are coordinating that, but given the first part of your message, I am not sure what the next step is, please advise.  Donna

Unfortunately CSFB claims to be unable to locate the ENA document.  If we can use our copy they will accept our changes to the ECI document.  We should send both the ENA and the ECI docs so they can compare quickly and avoid additional delays.

Dear Sara,

It was wonderful to talk with you the other day.  I was looking for an
excellent image of the Fiam mirrors and the best that I could find were on
the Fiam website -- as it is in macromedia flash, I am unable to copy and
attach.  Hence, I am listing their web address -- once on their site, chose
english version and then products, there are many different mirrors
available and my personal favorite is Caadre in natural with light.  Prices
range from $5,478 to $6,174 w/integrated lamp.  This is for the free
standing floor version that measures:  76.75" x 41.3" w.

www.fiamitalia.it

Let me know what you think.

All best wishes,

David

Lisa:

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Susan,

Did Greg say that the cash is still in ERMT or was it "swept" back up into ENA or Enron Corp.?

I just confirmed with Greg Whiting in Accounting that RMT made $ 250 MM contribution to ERMT.  (RMT obtained such funds through a capital contribution from ENA, which in turn received a $250 MM contribution from Enron Corp.)

Tri-Met is the regional transportation company for the greater Portland area.  A good overview can be found on www.tri-met.org <http://www.tri-met.org>.  From the web page, the full name and address is:

Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (Tri-Met)
4012 SE 17th Avenue
Portland, OR 97202

The ISDA that we left with them was dated 1992 and was a generic version.  We have not even had credit discussions yet.  

Let me know if you would like any additional information.
Thanks,
John

Debbie and Tanya:
I thought it might be helpful to summarize how certain of the collateral provisions in our trading agreements are impacted by the filing of bankruptcy:

1.	ISDA Credit Support Annex - Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an Early Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment obligation exists.  In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us.

2.	Industrial Master - same as above except that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash.

3.	Annex B - the Event of Default/Early Termination Date conditions only apply to requests to reduce collateral, not to a demand to post collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.


4.	EEI Master (without new collateral annex attached)- no conditions precedent in the EEI to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.  The new collateral annex works like the ISDA Credit Support Annex except  that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash


5.	Enfolio Master Purchase and Sale Agreement -  no conditions precedent in the Enfolio to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.

Hope this helps.  Call me if you have any questions.

All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the April 2002 options contract for Copper (HXJ2)
and Aluminum (OAJ2) is Monday, March 25, 2002.

	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.










	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the April 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will cease
at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on March 25, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, March 25, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a duly
authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning, March 26, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


















CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"

MUCH THANKS!!!

Sara,
In reading Schedule 2, we may be able to make the case that it does not apply to us as we are trading for our own proprietary account for ECT Investments, Inc. 
Schedule 2 talks about different funds.  I think this more relates to a fund manager who is managing several funds which take outside investment funds.

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Accordingly, I will be preparing the agreements to cover physical power, and Brent and Sara will prepare the agreeements to cover financial power.  I will finalize Entergy by tomorrow and will then proceed down the list.  I anticipate that I should be able to prepare at least five or so by Friday.

Adam,

To follow-up on our discussion from last week:

With regards to the need for equity/certificates at the Trust level, this is really a function of the requirements posed by the investors.  Our tax group would defer to the underwriters. If the note investors can tolerate equity treatment (for tax purposes), then there should be no need for certificates in the structure.  In previous transactions, the presence of certificates has allowed the notes to be treated as debt for tax purposes and therefore the payments treated as interest income.

With regards to cross-default, a default in the Enron note does not result in a default of the swap between Enron and the third party entity or a default of the swap between Enron and the financial institution.


Attached is a diagram of the prepay structure, as discussed last week.

 


Feel free to call with any questions.

Regards,
Travis Winfrey

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Steph:

FYI, I had a conversation with Estella Chu (sp?) of GLCC this morning.  She wanted a monthly MTM report (which apparently Craig Breaslow's (sp?) group used to provide) and also wanted information about terminating the contract.  I instructed her to fax to you and write-in to the contract notification address her issues, including her request to terminate.  She also asked for your phone number, which I provided, so you may be getting a call from her (or may already have received a call from her).

Carson,

Sorry for the failure to respond to your e-mail but I've been out of town more
than I've been here for the past year.  My business development duties were
concentrated in the Rockies.  I've spent a lot of time in Denver and Utah.  Now
my position has been eliminated with the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus.  I was
offered another position in Houston and one in Oklahoma City but the severence
package looked more attractive than either of those positions.  I've agreed to
stay through the first quarter for the transition.  I'm considering a new career
as a wine taster.  It don't think it will pay well but it would be a lot more
fun!!

Thursday is fine for me.  Le Vista also sounds good but the high temp is
predicted to be below 40 on Thursday.  In case the prediction is correct, do you
know of another place where we can bring our own wine?  If not, we can just go
to my house which is only a couple of blocks from there.

(Sara, is Thursday night okay for you?)

Donna

At long last my ship has come in. Another evening with not one but the two most
beautiful, sexy, intelligent,
elegant, open mined, ( shall I say more ) women in Houston. How I have patiently
waited and emailed to no
avail for such a night. I have a select bottle of Cakebread that was to be
consumed by you and me on your
birthday, back in July.  Can we consume it to celebrate both you and Sara's
birthdays?

I am going out of town tomorrow but will be back in town late Wednesday. So lets
get together this Thursday.
I can not wai. We can go to Le Vista again and bring our own wine or anywhere
else you two want to go. But I
do want to consume this bottle of Cakebread, and I have some other bottles that
I can throw in also.

Thanks so much for putting this together. I have missed seeing you both.

Carson

We received their payment today.  It included Dec01 through Mar02 invoices, some of which were new due ENA, other net due BG&E, with the sum of all amounts being owed to ENA.  It appears that they netted accordingly.  We can discuss whether they is allowable or not.  (This is the same scenario as with Merced.)

Susan: Please note in the DLL that payment was received 3/21/02 and that they netted post-petition invoices.

Non-EOL trades can be treated substantially the same way, i.e. each trade would be novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master.

You're correct, ECTRIC traders cannot trade in the name of ENA from London; to do so would create a regulatory and tax presence in the UK for ENA, which should be avoided.

There are two other possibilities:

1.	Conclude a separate ISDA between ECTRIC and the C/P.  This would be based substantially on the existing ISDA Master with ENA, but it would need to be adapted to accommodate the different tax status of ECTRIC.  And we could agree to offer the C/P an Enron Corp Guarantee in support. 

2.	Adapt the existing ISDA Master with ENA by adding ECTRIC as a third party.  This would mean the addition of new provisions to accommodate the different tax status of ECTRIC.  And again, an Enron Corp Guarantee could be offered to support ECTRIC's obligations.  However, consideration would need to be given as to the validity of the close-out netting provisions of that ISDA where a party becomes bankrupt - this is a US bankruptcy question.

However, given the time that would be involved in concluding 1. and 2. above, as well as the sensitivity of the C/Ps to negotiating revised or new documents, the novation route may be preferable.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Regards
Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

Sara,

I'm attaching a draft of the futures agreement to "get the ball rolling"
again.  I believe I have included the terms you indicated were most
important.  One item I would like to bring to your attention is the
arbitration clause.  Morgan Stanley prefers to litigate disputes, but I
can agree to NFA arbitration rather than litigation.  I know New York is
our preferred location, and Texas is yours, so I thought that holding
the arbitration in Chicago might equally inconvenience us.   Please let
me know if this works for you.

Regards,

Tammy

Is this to obtain outside opinion?  I thought we were going to do that at our own expense.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Travis,

Apologies for the delayed response - we have had some e-mails problems this week.

Understood and agreed on the need for equity certificates.  As you know, in the US there is no bright line amount of equity that is required in order to obtain the best treatment, so therefore we
thought it best for both you and we to do our research for Japan and then approach counsel.  We should have our opinion formed shortly both on the feasibility of equity treatment for the fixed income
investors and on the need for certificates.

We'd like to talk through a couple more alternatives to make sure we understand the accounting restrictions to cross-default in orders.  I'll call you to discuss further.  In that call I'd also like
to make sure that I understand the prepay.

Finally, we are working through a couple of accounting issues on the CLN and also on the reps that you want from Merrill.

I am traveling tomorrow and will call you on Monday.

Regards,

Adam

	Adam,

	To follow-up on our discussion from last week:

	With regards to the need for equity/certificates at the Trust
level, this is really a function of the requirements posed by the
investors.  Our tax group would defer to the underwriters. If the note
investors can tolerate equity treatment (for tax purposes), then there
should be no need for certificates in the structure.  In previous
transactions, the presence of certificates has allowed the notes to be
treated as debt for tax purposes and therefore the payments treated as
interest income.

	With regards to cross-default, a default in the Enron note does
not result in a default of the swap between Enron and the third party
entity or a default of the swap between Enron and the financial
institution.


	Attached is a diagram of the prepay structure, as discussed last
week.

	 <<CLN Prepay Diagram - Merrill Lynch.ppt>>


	Feel free to call with any questions.

Dear Sara: Hope all is well. I apologies for the delay in reverting to you.
In any event, I have "marked-up" ENA's proposed documentation with some
amendments. Please note that I have based my response on the recently
executed ISDA Agreement between CSFBi and Enron Credit Limited.
Please note that I will need to discuss with our credit the proposed
threshold amounts. I will revert to you on this point shortly.
Additionally, I would like to discuss with you in detail the events of
default relating to the custodian.
Once you have had an opportunity to review the attached document, please
kindly contact me to discuss this matter further.
As always I thank you for your cooperation.
Kind regards
Anita

Beth,

As Greg Asaf has mentioned to you, we believe that there are some weather positions that require prompt attention. I am especially concerned that we get moving on the curve validation and position understanding prior to the group leaving on February 28th. The following is a list of those positions: 

Goldman Sachs Puts
These trades have all been terminated as of December 4, 2001. We believe that there is between $31 million and $36 million of value to Enron in these transactions.  These are extremely large relative to the market and will require special attention to negotiate out of. 

ABN/AMRO (London) Calls
This short call position is part of the largest transaction ever executed in the weather market.  Accordingly, this is also a potentially difficult negotiation. In discussions with ABN/AMRO they have expressed a willingness to let us out of these flat and are sending me a letter to that effect.

Cargill (Europe) Portfolio
We are out of the money to Cargill about $300K, but to avoid the hassle of managing the positions Cargill would just like to let us out flat.  They have been trying to reach someone to help them.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District ("SMUD") and related put options
The precipitation put options hedging this transaction are held by Enron Re which is going into voluntary liquidation.  The contracts with the insurance companies require that we maintain a weather station at the site.  The group responsible for managing the sites no longer exists.

AIG Put Options
This curve needs to be validated and our value independently confirmed. Again, there are unique attributes to this transaction that should be worked out while we are still here.

Enron Re
In addition to the puts held by Enron Re, we have a $4 million receivable with Enron Re.

Mark.

Laurel and Sara.  UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.  You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.  The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.  Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.  It sounds very interesting to me.  Let me know what you think.  I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.

Thank you.

Veronica,
I assume that since you did not get back to us that there are no LC's expiring in January for non-terminated masters or trades where we are in the money.  If that is the case then we need to start looking at those LC's for February and March to avoid any time constraints in getting replacement LC's.  Please revert back to Sara with copies of the LC's that expire in February and March for the non-terminated masters and contracts that are in the money.

Regards, 
Brent

I am trying to determine if there are any of the LC's expiring in January that we can request renewal for.  Veronica were you able to narrow down the list to ones that are non-terminated where Enron is still exposed?  Please call to discuss.

Brent

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Brent -

I have attached both the Williams and Bank of America amendment forms for you to take a look at when you have a chance.  It is interesting to note that the Williams schedule skips Part 5 and contains the general provisions in Part 4.   Also, with the BofA document, there were some terms in Part 5(h) that looked to have been negotiated terms.  These have basically been incorporated into the Amendment so that the integrity of the agreement remains intact.

Please take a look at the attached is necessary.  I have both files in my office if you should need them.

Thanks.

Mark

How Enron Blew It=20
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=
.php>>=20
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.

"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Michelle,

I have been working with Jan-Erland and Stefan on this project with respect to the tax issues.  This product will now be entered into by ENA (rather than by Enron Japan Corp. as had been looked at before) and Robert Fuller (i.e., a trader in Houston) is being posted as the allowable trader.  Two transactions will occur once a Japanese counterparty enters into the transaction through EnronOnline:  (1) It will enter into the WTI swap, which is denominated in JPY, with ENA; and (2) because ENA will have the JPY FX risk, it will enter into a JPY hedge transaction.  Note that for the JPY FX hedge, we will need to make a same day hedging identification for US tax purposes.  Do you know who I should contact to confirm that this identification will be made?

Best regards,
Susan

Michelle,
We spoke to Jan-Erland when he was here.  For our part, ENA will do a currency trade with Enron Japan.  We will confirm and settle with them as with other international companies.

I received this from the Tokyo office.  
John - I am not sure what book this will go it.  Could you check and see if EOL / Nowlan is aware of transaction if it will be part of our books?
Sheila - The deal discusses much interaction w/ Gary Hickerson on the FX side.  Are you aware?
Angelo - Looks like they want to settle via ENA.  Are you on board w/ this?
Michael - from a legal aspect, is ENA set up for this type of trade?
Thanks,

Michelle,

Sorry for calling you at home yesterday.

Please find attached the documentation as promised.

As Jan-Erland mentioned, the transaction is very straight forward. It is basically the same product as the existing 24/7 USD WTI Swap. The only difference is the contract currency which is JPY. 
The floating price in the transaction once it is determined needs to be converted into JPY. To do this we use the mid of the Bid and Offer FX rate published by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. You can find this FX rate on Reuters (page TKFF). As ENA will be counterparty in this transaction you will probably be involved in the settlement. What we wanted to make sure is that you feel happy in getting all relevant numbers for a smooth settlement.

A quick response from you side would be highly appreciated.
Thank you!

Kind Regards,
Stefan Niesler

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

This should help clean things up a lot.  Please let me know when they have been removed, such that I can get credit to rerun the list of active deals.  It would be great if it is ready early tomorrow as I would like my guy to create the spreasheet with gas/power/crude/etc/total for our meeting tomorrow.

Artie McCoy, VP Financial Surveillance with the NYMEX, 212/299-2928, is awaiting our decision as to whether it is our intention to withdraw from trading on the NYMEX.  Sara, as you may recall, I passed his name on to you about 10 days ago, before UBS surprised us when they walked in and said they were now rethinking wanting the seats again.  So I called Artie back at that time and said the situation was evolving, and once we knew what UBS wanted to do we would let him know.  That's where we left it.

In our morning meeting yesterday you asked what the financial picture looked like on this CP.

This is in-the-money (ITM) to ENA approximately $69,000.  There is one gas swap (TAGG# VH6425), which expires Jun02.

Hope this helps.

wanted to follow up on whether you've received terms from your Credit Dept.

	Mr. Suchdev,

	Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which supplements the
ISDA
	Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has furnished us
with
	the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to provide a
version
	which includes the credit features.

	Hope this helps in the interim.

Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Sara,

I know we haven't spoken much this month about the goldman account, but are we nearly complete on the transfer to ECI from ENA?

Thanks,

The Confirm Desk has confirmed that there are no live physical deals with US Brick.  I see from Global Contracts that there is a GISB that was assigned as part of the CES deal.  I will pull a copy of that contract even though there are no trades.  The confirm desk is making sure that the two trades referenced by US Brick are in fact the only live financial deals.  There is no ISDA Master - they must have been just confirms.  We have begun a file - I will check with the list Alan just emailed to make sure there are not other items we need.

Attached is the information concerning U.S. Brick a division of Tiffany Brick Company, L.P.  It appears that our current exposure is in the money $383,108 to Enron at close of business 2-4-02 which is substantially less then the $200,000 proposal by U.S. Brick.

We have received a settlement offer from U.S. Brick with respect to two financial trades (V48090.1, V48242.1 dated April 20, 2001) on GTC's.  CP is disputing previoius invoices and has not yet terminated the trades.

Settlement offer is $200,00 per letter dated January 22, 2002.

I think it needs to be a Fallon/Dimichele discussion with UBS, and a communication should go out to EWS Estate personnel letting them know the ground rules. I'll raise with Vicki this weekend when I see her.

Do any of you have any problems with keeping these trades as they are now that we've figured out what they are.  If not we'll just keep them as they were...

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  


Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.

Mary,
Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.  The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.  In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.

The amount is $985,614.39.

Please advise.

Mike Kustra was in to meet Gary for Morgan Stanley today.

Mike has been told that the only thing outstanding is the place of jusidiction and Chicago has been agreed to as the compromise.

Please let me know if this agrees with your view.

As I do not have any details of this deal, I cannot comment on the need for a carve out of margining rights. The only issue that I have been aware of is the Cayman branch possibility.  My comment on that to bothe Raj and Teresa was that if it is in fact a different legal entity (as determined by legal) then I will need financial information to make an assessment of this entity.  If it is a branch and part of CSFB International, which is sometimes the case with financial institutions, we would have recourse to CSFB International and it would be confirmed under the existing document.

Tanya

Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help.

Good morning, Sara.

My legal contact just got back to me with her comments on your proposed
changes to the standard Agreement for Prime Brokerage Clearance Services.
Here are her comments regarding those changes she finds unacceptable:

"1)  Section 9 -  I think many of the fees charged are prevailing market
fees and not necessarily agreed to by the parties.  I'd prefer to keep this
language as is.

2) Section 11 - the representations in this agreement are fairly basic and
I would therefore consider any breach of a rep as material.  Therefore, I'd
prefer not to make the suggested change to clause (ii).  Also, please do
not delete the language 'together with interest earned thereon from the
date of such Event of Default' at the end of this section.

3) Section 14, paragraph (a) - you can add the word 'reasonable' but please
do not add the word 'materially' to this paragraph."

Please let me know what you think. I'll work with you in every way I can to
reach a consensus on the terms of the agreement.

Thank you,

Susan: please update the Master Demand Log with the information below.  Let's make sure we DO NOT send a termination letter on Friday.  We need to attempt to resolve this payment question first.

Sara: we'll discuss this in the morning.

Thanks

Talked to Bill O'Brien today.  He contends that Select made required payments, with the exception of some holdbacks which were clearly documented and provided to Enron.  Select wants to perform under the contract until that time we can mutually negotiate an early termination.  He is faxing 26 pages of information which supports Select's previous payments.

Bill requests that Enron:
q	Provide current written payment instructions
q	If we cannot resolve the payment dispute tomorrow (demand letter deadline), rescind the demand letter w/ rights to reopen after analysis is complete
q	Have Enron's attorney contact Select's attorney (see fax cover sheet for contact information)

Bill expressed concern that Enron would send a termination notice tomorrow (3/8/02) prior to resolution of the payment dispute.  I assured him that our intention was to resolve the payment issue if possible, reserving that we might agree to differ if resolution isn't possible.

(1)  Received a voice mail from Bill O'Brien (credit manager) of Select Energy at 860-665-2376.

He says that payments were previously made on the referenced invoices and he is pulling the data together.  He wants to talk on Thursday.  Louis, can you call him please?

(2)  Received a demand letter from Stone Energy Corporation which cites ENA's (i) failure to pay Stone $46,564 under the swap EV3943.1 which will be a default in 2 business days, and (ii) bankruptcy.  Stone may later designate an Early Termination Date.

Stone will also offset amounts owed by ENA Upstream Company to Stone.

Louis:  we need to verify the swap payment issue and I'll have a copy of the letter sent to you.

I'm not so sure of that because we couldn't see all of the wire transfers.  There was a credit to the new entity's account in the amount of $250 million on November 5th and then there was a debit of $249,900,000 on the 6th.  It looks like that money went into a Goldman Sachs account.

Bryan,

Deuthsche Bank served a credit notice to ECT Investments Inc. for the "triplets" trade.  This trade is not ECT Investments Inc.'s.  All the Credit business was transferred to Enron North America on November 2000 and the Credit book was transferred to Enron Credit Inc. in February 2001.  This trade should not be in ECT Investments Inc.'s name and should have been transferred by Enron Credit.

I would expect Enron Credit Inc. to settle the financial liablility of this trade and not leave it as an obligation to ECT Investments, Inc.

My understanding is that the obligation is around $800,000.

Please advise.

Regards,
Sheila

Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Sara -

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend
that agreement to carve it out).

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the
provision in question and ask him when he has some availability to get on a
call in the beginning of next week to discuss.

Regards,
Michelle

Per my voice mail, please:

(1) review the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 1,
2000 (Section 4.4(d)) between Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC and Enron
Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff
language, and

(2) please forward a copy of the proposed setoff language to Anthony Wilson
so that he can explain what portion of the provision violates Section 6 of
PUHCA.  I will be available for a call at his (and your) convenience.

Thanks.  Sara

   I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a "unilateral" approach
   to
   include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted
   by
   PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney)
   and
   he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
   applied to both of us or neither of us).

   Let me know if you need to discuss this further - in which case we will
   get
   on a call (Yair, you and myself) to discuss.

      As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
      incorporating
      the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
   ISDA
      (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
   is
      the
      last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
      suggest
      that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
   agreement
      since it is the final version.

       <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

      Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
      which
      point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
      page)
      via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
      Schedule with your revised Schedule.

      Thank you for your patience.

Susan, please substitute the setoff language set forth in the attached to each of the referenced items in the swap form bank.  If there are any other items in the swap form bank that you think also need the new language, please advise.  There may be additional language for a Canadian alternative; Peter is reviewing this further with Canadian counsel.  Susan, also please note that as I update the US Industrial I will include this new language, but for now, put it in the current US Industrial form.  After you have substituted the language, please provide me with one copy of each form for a final check.  Thank you.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

This trade needs to be unwound and ECT Investments taken out of the loop.  
We should not be a counterparty on the trade.  Please confirm your course of action.

It's the triplets trade.  We probably owe about 800K that we would have to pay.  The trade was originally done with ECT Investments and never re assigned.

Notice No. 01-406

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	EXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECUTION
AND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced an expanded slate of
natural gas products and services that it plans to introduce on an expedited
basis, including an electronically traded, cleared Henry Hub swaps contract
for the December 3 trading session, which begins with the NYMEX ACCESS

session on Sunday night, December 2; listings of additional natural gas
futures contracts as far as six years out beginning with the NYMEX ACCESS

session tonight; extended natural gas options contracts beginning with the
Monday open outcry session; and large order execution (LOX) in the first two
months of the natural gas futures contract also beginning tomorrow.

The contract specifications for the Henry Hub swaps contract will closely
parallel those of the Henry Hub futures contract other than it will be
financially settled, based on the final settlement price of the Henry Hub
futures contract.  The trading symbol will be NN.  Trading will begin at 7
PM Sunday night, with a pre-opening session beginning at 3 PM.

The Exchange currently lists the natural gas futures contract for 36
consecutive months and will list an additional 36 consecutive months
beginning tomorrow.  The Exchange currently lists 12 consecutive months of
natural gas options and eight additional quarterly contracts on a
March/June/September/December cycle, and, on Monday, will add 12 additional
quarterly contracts on the same cycle.  The Henry Hub swaps contract will be
available for the closest 72 consecutive months.

LOX will be permitted throughout the open outcry sessions, except during the
closing range. Under the new procedures, orders for a minimum of 250
contracts and a maximum of 5,000 contracts will be permitted outside of the
bid/ask spread for smaller trades, as long as the trade is within the
session's maximum price fluctuation limits.

Floor traders wishing to participate in a LOX market on behalf of a customer
or themselves must verbally submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an Exchange
employee, who will act as the LOX book holder, stipulating the delivery
month and number of contracts involved. The book holder will only recognize
initial responses that are for the full amount of the RFQ. Once a response
to the RFQ is formally recognized, the requesting member has 30 seconds to
react to the market.

There will be a $2.50 per contract charge for any RFQ that receives a
responding quote. If the RFQ results in a trade, the fee will be reduced to
$1.50 per contract.

Members trading for their own accounts may participate in a trade subsequent
to the initial response, but the member who first responded with the best
bid or offer for the large order will never receive less than a 50%
allocation of a completed trade.

In addition to formally recognizing the participants involved in a LOX
order, the book holder will be responsible for enforcing time limits,
maintaining records, and ensuring that trades with multiple responding
participants are allocated to the provisions in the rules.

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NO=
T flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that E=
nron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically a=
t the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Th=
us, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for t=
hat margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Ou=
r swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of=
 the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap=
 could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but i=
n essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margi=
n MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not re=
ceive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, y=
ou wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the=
 money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the o=
ffice tomorrow, but I will be back on Monday.

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

F/y/i -- ECTRIC filed for bankruptcy protection in the US on 2/11/2002, so we'll need to confirm whether these payments must now be made into the Enron Corp. DIP account.

Subject:	Greenfield - ECTRI Loan Note

Peter,

The details of the promissory note ("Loan Note 2002") from Greenfield to ECTRI in payment of agreed interest rate swap breakage costs in connection with the November 2001 Greenfield equity sale/LAKSHMI vessel financing workout transaction are as follows:

Maker: 			Greenfield Shipping Company Limited
Holder:			Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
Guarantor: 		Mitsui OSK Lines, Ltd.
Date of Note: 		November 20, 2001
Principal Amount:	US$12,720,000.00
Interest Rate: 		5% per annum (based on 360 day year)
ECTRI Swap Deal No.:	M148198

Repayment Schedule*:
	1st Payment:	January 31, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	2nd Payment:	February 28, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	3rd Payment:	March 29, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	Final Payment:	April 30, 2002 -- remaining balance of principal plus accrued interest.

	* Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Loan Note is repayable in full upon refinancing of the vessel by Greenfield. 

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I'm copying Enron lawyers Alan Aronowitz and Sara Shackleton on this note so that they are also aware of the details of this ECTRI receivable and the fact that MOL appear to be arranging payment on behalf of Greenfield to ECTRI (at least for the January and February 2002 instalment obligations).

Kind regards,
Dan Rogers

Alan,

There is an outstanding $4m receivable due from Enron Re to ENA and various premiums in a lesser amount due from ENA to Enron Re (in relation to cover for the AIG puts). The EGM people are talking about offsetting one against the other. The rationale behind this "internal" settlement is not obvious to me but I am likely not in possession of all the facts. Do you know anything about this? How do you propose we handle? Thanks in advance. DEC

Subject:	CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket Documentation

Good Morning Sara,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding the CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket documentation. Since the last time we spoke here are some of the issues discussed along with some additional recommendations.

1) Finalizing the Master ISDA Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited. I see that the status is under Credit Review.

2) Definitions:
	a) Interest Payment Date- should state "3 business days after the Valuation Date"
	b) Reference Price- amend the phrase "..last regular way trade..." to state "...Official Closing Price..." in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii).
	c) Securities- Omit the reference to "Bonds". The definition should only read: "are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation".
	d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002
	
3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: "If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity".

We should include a definition for "Dividend Payment Date" to read, "The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends". We should also include a definition for "Dividend Amount". The "Dividend Amount" definition should read, "100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period".

I believe we should address Section 5.2 "Potential Adjustment Event". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to "determine" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein.

4) Schedule to Basket Swaps:
	a) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read "1 month"
	b) Termination Date: should read "1 year"
	c) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA "Modified Following Business Day Convention" language.

5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.

Please advise if you like to meet to discuss the documentation in further detail.

Regards,

Jorge A. Garcia

Sara,  I further questioned Raju about whether the "North Sea, West Africa" changes the language they use - but she hasn't gotten back to me yet.   Until then, see her answer below.......

Hi Diane,

Sorry about the delay but I just got back from a meeting. Anyway, the language looks fine. Attached is an example of what we use on our confirms.

Raju,  Any luck?  Our attorney, Sara Shackelton, was hoping you could confirm this language today.  

Let me know.

Raju,

You can ignore the second half of this (from the conversion on).  Can you confirm that this is the correct name and location in Platts.

Let me know.
Cheers,
Diane

The arithmetic average of the daily means of the high and low quotations for North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean - Dubai (lead month) as published in Platt's Crude Oil Marketwire in respect of the applicable Determination Period, multiplied by 0.159 and converted into Japanese Yen at the TTM rate (being the average of the TTB rate and the TTS rate) published by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. at or after 10am on the Termination Date.

is this the file I sent last week?  NYMEX - I would talk to Elaine Schield or Greg Whiting; however, this data is as of 11/30 before terminations and the like - so we may well have had open positions on the nymex.  I suspect it is made up of the forward value to the contracts, accrued interest, etc. I have no idea what the number is today - again Elaine or Leslie Reeves would be the best contact.  I suspect there are entries for both JPM and Chase Man because our back office was booking to both places even though that was not correct.  If the back office doesn't move the deals over, the data will be in both places.  It is all about data integrity - there will be many issues like this, I suspect.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

Cassandra,

As several of the MRM functions have recently been transferred to Donna
Lowry's group, we had originally requested documentation from her group in
conjunction with our MRM audit.  However, due to the fact that we are
looking at processes for the first part of the year, thus before these
functions were transferred to Donna's group, we were hoping for your
assistance in obtaining the below requested documentation.

          Please provide a listing of all open brokerage accounts as of
   August 15, 2001.
          Please provide a listing of all new brokerage accounts for the
   year 2001.
          What documentation is maintained for the approval of new
   brokerage accounts?
           How do you ensure no unauthorized accounts are opened?
           Please provide the authorized trader list provided to the
   brokers in order to identify which traders are authorized to transact on
   Enron's behalf.
>From the listing of brokerage accounts obtained, we will select several to
test for proper approvals.  Therefore, we will have an additional request
once we receive the above information.   As we are in the process of
completing our audit, we would appreciate your prompt assistance.  In
addition, if you are not the appropriate contact for obtaining this
information, please provide the correct contact name and we will redirect
our request.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.  If you have any questions,
please call me at X6-6269 or Sharon Smith at X6-6209.

Thank you,
Jennifer

Please advise if this is a workable alternative.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this?

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice?

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

I have no problem with the format.  I have not talked to Maria.  I got a call from Michael Emerson (today), which I have not answered--he wants to get the confirm signed and leave the VE discussion (on form of opinion) until later this week [and I have no problem with that either].  Why don't you finalize it with Maria and ask her to tell Michael that later this week for VE discussion is fine?  Thanks.

John - I returned a call to Ira Polk and Kevin Davis today at Man.  Ira was not in so I spoke with Kevin.  

Kevin asked me if Enron would consider posting more margin than required by NYMEX on our option positions. He said that "given ENE is now flush with liquidity" he thinks it would make Enron "look good" in front of the EDF Board.  He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would be "ecstatic" with 1.5x (about $5 million.)  He specifically asked me not to elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what EDF is asking of ENE.  He also told me that if we did not post the additional margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market moved against our positions.  Kevin also state that EDF is too small compared to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deals and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank.  

I have been out of town so may be missing on part of the story but I think it's ridiculous that EDF wants us to do them a favour when they ditched us when Enron was in a  severe liquidity crisis.  I told Kevin that I did not think we would meet his request but that would check on it internally.

Sara,

Have you been able to get any information on the corporate ownership of EFET.  ABN/AMRO requries this information to make decisions on the disposition of their trades with us.  Ideally, they would like a corporate org. chart and balance sheet.  

I am also going to contact Ted Murphy and Eric Shaw.

Thank you

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

I am sure the captioned parties have not been included in any master netting agreements to date and should not be included due to marketing affiliate rules; however, given the financings of the pipes, just a reminder TO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN ANY MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT.

Sara,

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove "business day" and insert something along the lines of "market day" and define "market day" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Regards,

Tammy

In October we sent $8.2MM from the EBS Ventures MSDW account to this Cherokee bank account because the EBS investments in this MSDW account are in the Apache tax structure and therefore have to go through this bank account.  Since the $12K pertains to the same investment as the $8.2MM, I knew that we would have to send it to the same account.  Danny Wilson and Marian Brisco are familiar with the Apache structure and can better answer any questions relating to the Cherokee account.

Thanks Carol.  We are dealing with these.  I believe that Energy West is another that expires before the end of December.  I will try to give you a call tomorrow on the inter-company swaps under the services agreement, and the effect of counterparty terminations on the book.

Christine -
Sara is out of the office for the rest of the week, but I understand why you guys have trouble with me specifically being listed.  Instead of my number being put in there, can we just use the general Enron Corp phone number (1-800-973-6766) and have UBS ask to be connected to the Treasurer's office.  There will always be a person there to take the call, and you will always be directed to the right person regardless of what employee reassignments may occur between now and then.

Jim, what do you think of this?  Christine, since Sara is out, would you please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list.  Thanks.
CF

Subject: Equity Forward Contract


Sara,

Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations 
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of 
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented. 
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any 
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the 
termination notice would not be effective.

We propose to insert the following language instead:


	"Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts 
to 
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by 
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party, 
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway 
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile 
transmission."
     
     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under 
"Additional 
     Termination Event".)

Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new 
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round 
of signatures.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any 
inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Christine

Ed and Bill:
Per Leslie reeves, we did receive a payment from LG&E Energy Marketing so the only issue remaining on them is whether the LC has been renewed.  As Ed reported, El Paso renewed their LC so there is nothing to do on that.  With respect to Enserco, I faxed the proposed new LC to ed and spoke with Don Perkins, their credit manager (303) 568-3255.  I told him that he may be receiving a call from you regarding Fortis, the Issuer.  I also told him that drawing condition #1 would have to change to take out the reference to delivery of natural gas and he agreed.  He was also going to talk to Lynn Evans, his attorney, about the procedures that need to be followed under 'Special Instructions" as I do not think that we should be sending anything to Fortis.  More to come tomorrow.


Ed:
Please e-mail me, Sara and Jeff a description of where things stand with Niagara based on their payment today as it sounds complicated and may require us to piece together all of the contracts we have with them before deciding how to proceed.  Did you have any luck confirming the status of the  Chase LC?

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Please click on the link below.

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

if we agree. they are the calculation agent i am sure, but is this amount in the ballpark?? if we agree that do not have grounds to contest, then i think we are just collecting money unless you have heard something i haven't???

Bill and Ed:
On 12/21, we received a letter from Entergy-Koch stating that their calculation of the Final Settlement Amount under the Master Netting Agreement results in a payment from them to Enron of $10,384,673.  They are awaiting payment instructions.

Can we verify this amount?

Lisa,

If we are okay with this amount, can they pay it to us without getting E&*Y's approval?

I hope that after recent events we find you and yours all well.

We are still looking for information as to how we should proceed
in initiating an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron Capital &
Trade Resources International Corp. Cargill International, S.A.

      Hi Cheryl,

      I haven't had a response to our queries about putting in place an
   ISDA
      between Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. and
our
      Geneva affiliate, Cargill International, S.A. ("CISA").  We've
been
      trying to get negotiations started since January; I was hoping you

that
      we can get things moving on this ISDA?

      Dear Cheryl,

      I've again had inquiries from our Geneva affiliate, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA") regarding an ISDA Master Agreement
      with Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Are
      you still the attorney who would be handling this Agreement?
      If not, could you kindly advise whom I should contact?

      I assume that Enron would prefer to send the initial draft
      documents.  If this is the case, please note that CISA enters
      into its ISDA Master Agreements without benefit of a Credit
      Support Provider or a Credit Support Annex.  Regarding their
      administrative details, their address is:

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
      & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
      International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

?	Energy Service Providers LLC was set for payment of $420,000 on 12-14-01.  I have asked Mark Leskowitz to verify that payment was received.

?	The $3,922,500 L/C is associated with domestic crude deliveries to Trafigura AG.  ERAC has shorted Trafigura on the deliveries and on a net basis, we owe them money on 12/20.  We should let this l/c expire.

EGLI is holding a $420,000 LC that expires 12/21/01 covering a deal with Energy Service Providers LLC.  According to our records, this deal has terminated.  Have we been paid?  Are we owed anything?  Would we have any grounds for drawing prior to the expiry date?

Dear Sara:

I apologize for the delay but I have been unsuccessful in finding a good way
to get you your wine.  I am unable to ship FedEx or UPS unless it is going
to a distributor.  We have some customers who live in similar "unfriendly"
wine states who make arrangements with private mailing companies here in
California and we have mailed it to them.  Unfortunately, the danger in us
doing it is it could get held up somewhere along the way and they may
destroy it.  I believe it is too much wine to risk the possibility.

I will continue to look into other possibilities but if you have any
suggestions or are planning to be in another state soon, please let me know
and I will do whatever I can to get it to you.

Regards,


Jill Melendy
Dutton-Goldfield Winery

It is probably more for one of you to speak to him rather than myself.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Sara and Donna,
Gary has agreed that the Convertible Arbitrage Book should be transferred back to ECT Investments Inc. The Convertible Arbitrage Book was moved from ECT Investments, Inc. to Enron North America Corp., effective 1QTR2001.  

We will need to get this done before year-end.  The Convertible Book will need to be reported at year-end for SEC 13F reporting.  We want it included in ECT Investments' 13f  rather than do a ENA filing.

Theresa is calling GS and MSDW to see what they will require.

Gary,

Have you had a chance to think about this?

Farzad says it does not matter to him whether he trades as ENA, ECT Investments or XXX.

One important thing I just thought about is that I do not think we would want the Convertible Arbitrage Book Trading in London as Enron North America Corp.  Whether we are trading from London or Houston, our counterparties will be the same on Convertible Arbitrage Trading though the %s may change.  We use the Agent, Enron Investment Services Limited in London, to trade on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  

Thanks,
Sheila

Gary,

How strongly do you feel about not having the Convertible Arbitrage Book in ECT Investments?

We could move the Convertible Arbitrage Book back into ECT Investments before year-end.  Otherwise, we will need to do SEC 13f reporting for ENA.  

My concern would be:
Enron may not want to disclose certain positions in the Merchant Portfolio which are in the name of ENA.  We would need to include in the reporting all ENA Longs, long puts and long calls  >$200,000.  I am not sure how much we actually have in the name of Enron North America.
Does Enron want to do a SEC 13F with the Enron North America name and address?

If we move to a totally separate entity, we will need to set up new Prime Broker (2)  and Executing Broker Agreements (27)  for the new entity.

The return on capital can continue to be calculated based upon selected books.  

Thanks. Sheila

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Our London accounting group informed us that we needed to transfer positions held in Anker Coal from Enron Credit Inc to a Fair Value Entity, that was a US entitiy, rolling to EEL, that was set up to own brokerage accounts.  The ECTEF entity is the result.  

Should you need more details let me know.

Tom

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

1.   Replace Paragraph 1 with:



     This Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement (this "Agreement")
     is made and entered into effective as of November [   ], 2001 by and
     among BNP Paribas (including all branches and agencies thereof,
     "BNPP"), BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. ("PFI") and BNP Paribas
     Commodity Futures Limited ("BNPPCML"), and Enron Corp. ("Enron"),
     Enron North America Corp. ("ENA"), Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
     ("EPMI"), Enron Risk Management and Trading International Corp.
     ("ERMTIC"), Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
     ("ECTRIC"), Enron Credit Limited ("ECL"), Enron Metals Limited ("EML")
     and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited ("ECTD").



2.   Change definition of BNPP Party to "means each of BNPP, PFI and
BNPPCML."

3.   Change definition of Enron Party to " means each of Enron, ENA, EPMI,
ECTRIC, ERMTIC, ECL, EML and ECTD."

4.   In the definition of Transaction, insert before the word "between"
"(i)" and add at the end the following:

     or (ii) held at a contract market, exchange, board of trade or
     clearing organization by any Party on behalf of a member of the other
     Group pursuant to an Underlying Master Agreement.

5.   In Section 2(b), in (i), replace the phrase "all Transactions under
one or more Underlying Master Agreements" with "each Transaction".

6.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (ii) and (v) before the semi-colon,
insert the following:

     , under any other agreement or under applicable law or equity, whether
     in respect of the Transactions thereunder, or otherwise

7.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (iii), after "applicable law", insert
"or equity"

8.   In Section 4, in the third sentence, after the words "from whom such
payment is due" insert the following:

     to such Party or Parties as the Non-defaulting Group determines are
     entitled to such payment

9.   In Section 7(b), in each of the forth and the twelfth lines between
the words "hereby" and "grants", insert "except as provided in the next
sentence" and in each of the ninth and the sixteenth lines replace the text
beginning "Obligations, " until the end of each sentence with:

     Obligations.  Without limiting the rights referred to in Section 5,
     the security interest granted in the immediately preceding sentence
     shall not apply to the Final Settlement Amount.

10.   At the beginning of Sections 7(c) and 7(e), insert the words "Subject
to Section 3,".

11.   In Section 15(b), following the words "on the basis of a payment
owed", insert the words "(including margin)".

12.   With respect to Section 17, our client has indicated that it would
not be useful or efficient to have the issue of arbitration (which is
clearly not central to the risk reducing purposes of the arrangements)
mixed up with the proposed agreement, which has arisen from the
circumstances of Enron that have developed over the last few months.  BNP
Paribas' primary reason for not wanting to include an arbitration clause
(even with the suggested language changes) is that, although the concept of
arbitration is being considered generally, BNP Paribas has, of yet, not
made any definitive decisions as to the implicit or necessary value of
arbitration clauses and such a decision would require significant internal
review and discussion.  Over the next few months, further consideration can
be given as to including arbitration in this agreement.

13.  Please note that BNP Paribas contemplates at least one long-form
confirmation as an Underlying Master Agreement.

I have some other requests I have to fulfill today.
Thanks,

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

Carol,
	I have another customer, Cross Oil and Refining.  They have some gas hedges on that they would like to terminate and pay us up-front.  I don't believe they have a master ISDA agreement, can they do this transaction?   Thanks.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the "Confidentiality" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") or Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC").   I was asked to determine if the "Confidentiality" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) "the existence of a Master Agreement" or (b) "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially,

Susan,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Could I get an update on were we are with the top 20 customer amendments.  Last week we got 5 amendments for power physical but we still haven't received any amendments for financial.  Entergy-Koch is very interested in ConfirmLogic and have asked for the amendments.  When can we get the amendments for Entergy-Koch completed?

Thanks,

MS is a pass through in the transaction and should not be an issue.  Does RBS have commodity derivatives capability, they would also need a delta or MS type relationship. We would also need to have an ISDA master in place?

James send a email and said that he would update me when they had news.

Unfortunately CSFB claims to be unable to locate the ENA document.  If we can use our copy they will accept our changes to the ECI document.  We should send both the ENA and the ECI docs so they can compare quickly and avoid additional delays.

This account should be opened asap.  Tom, I assume as per our conversation, that you have obtained the account documentation required and it matches the agreements that have been previously signed, only changing the name of the entity and tax ID number.  All accounts that are used for trading by the debt traders should be changed to Enron Credit Inc.  If I can provide any assistance, please advise.  Donna Lowry, RAC Compliance

WRT the contract that has "cost of funds" (CoF) plus x for the default interest rate, I am struggling to get a number.  Someone in Deffner's group said he didn't know our CoF but that it will be a ridiculously high number.  I spoke to someone in Corp and he suggested that the contract might address an interest rate in the event of bankruptcy.  What do you think?

We received their payment today.  It included Dec01 through Mar02 invoices, some of which were new due ENA, other net due BG&E, with the sum of all amounts being owed to ENA.  It appears that they netted accordingly.  We can discuss whether they is allowable or not.  (This is the same scenario as with Merced.)

Susan: Please note in the DLL that payment was received 3/21/02 and that they netted post-petition invoices.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Sara,

All that you asked me to provide to Vijay was our form of Paragraph 13, which did not include any credit terms.  Essentially, we provided them with a "sample" of the what Paragraph 13 would look like minus the credit terms.

So the other task must have been with your assistant.

Sara and Susan,

I was just wondering whether you've received credit terms to include in the
Credit Support Annex Paragraph 13.  Once we receive these terms, I will
immediately consult my Credit Dept. and respond.

Thanks,

Vijay

		Mr. Suchdev,

		Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which
supplements
	the
	ISDA
		Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has
furnished us
	with
		the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to
provide a
	version
		which includes the credit features.

		Hope this helps in the interim.

I spoke w/ Brian Russo this morning.  He will submit payment for the invoice(s) amount on either today or tomorrow (3/13/02 or 3/14/02).  He agreed to submit separate payment for the default interest once we provide the rate.

Someone in settlements needs to contact him to determine Default Rate since BG&E wants to pay full amount (sounds like all deals have terminated)

I just confirmed with Greg Whiting in Accounting that RMT made $ 250 MM contribution to ERMT.  (RMT obtained such funds through a capital contribution from ENA, which in turn received a $250 MM contribution from Enron Corp.)

Best regards,
Susan

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.

2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

First Union Securities, Inc.

Ms. Shackleton,

Attached find a revised draft ISDA Schedule, both a marked copy and a clean
copy, for your review.  We just made a few changes to the draft ISDA
Schedule to mirror the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement in place
between First Union National Bank and Enron North America Corp.  Please note
that we have added a Credit Support Annex as a Credit Support Document.
Could you please send a CSA Paragraph 13 in the form previously agreed in
the Enron North America Corp. ISDA Master Agreement.


 <<Schedule 7-20-01 vs. Ctpty draft Schedule.doc>> 	 <<Schedule
7-20-01.doc>>

Also, as the parties may enter into EITF-0019 compliant trades, we would
like to duplicate the current ISDA once we've agreed on the terms, then
delete the Set-off provision and Credit Support Annex from the ISDA and
execute this pared down ISDA to cover 0019 trades only.  We believe it would
be beneficial from a netting perspective to execute separate ISDAs to cover
0019 trades, on the one hand, and any other equity derivative trades which
the parties may enter into, on the other hand.  Could you advise if this is
satisfactory.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks and regards,

Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating =
with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to=
 compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the e=
nd of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this aftern=
oon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our =
rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankr=
uptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when=
 in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afte=
rnoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with=
 Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under =
the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of th=
e expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can d=
eclare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination pay=
ment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the=
 cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  Tha=
t's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

Thanks for your reply Cheryl.

Could you both clarify something for me. 

We use the termination log as the basis for terminating our physical and financial deals.  Now, if the log shows the counterparty as terminating the ISDA - do we terminate only financial deals?  Does this mean physical deals, unless specified in the log, remain as live deals?

We're just a bit confused as to how we should be using the log to terminate deals.

Thanks,
Shifali

I think that the termination on Dec. 14th may have been a termination of the GSP - ENA financial ISDA, not the physical deal.

Cheryl,

We have a physical recyled paper deal (YM6441.1) with Garden State that was done on 02 February, 2002.  

The Termination log that Stephanie Panus sends us shows the termination date for Garden State as 14 December, 2001.  Does this mean that this particular deal is valid and do we keep it on the books as a live deal?

Thanks,
Shifali

Jaime:

As I told you before, Sara Shackleton is the lawyer of the Estate in charge of all financial trading matters.  I prepared a memo to her that included the MTM you gave me and also the status of the contract with each counterparty.  One question Sara had was about the date of the MTM valuation you sent me.  I know it is a bit old but cannot recall the exact date.  Could you please let Sara know the date and who exactly prepared the valuation (I am talking about the MTM you sent me).

Also, please let Sara know all your contact info.

Sara, Steve Irvin is also helping on Mexican matters.  Steve, is located in Houston and he works with Don Miller

Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=

We received the cash PSCC promised to pay.  As best we can determine they are paid in full and their financial positions are now expired.

Susan: Please note both "paid in full" and "expired" on the Demand Letter Log. 

Maria: Please reclassify this CP as "expired" on our list.  When you rerun the Apr02-forward MTM this CP should show $0.  If not, let's investigate.

Thanks all.

I appreciate all the helpful tips I've received from networking with my
good friends regarding my present job search.  I thought I'd pass along
this example regarding the importance of an attentive interview response.

The Job Interview

Steve, who was born without ears, needed to hire a new manager. The next
day
he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything
he needed and was very interesting. But at the end of the interview, Steve
asked him, "Do you notice anything different about me?" And the gentleman
answered, "Why yes, I couldn't help but notice that you have no ears."
Steve
did not appreciate his candor and threw him out. The second interview was
with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. But he asked her
the same question, "Do you notice anything different about me?" She
replied:
"Well, you have no ears." Steve again got upset and tossed her out. The
third and last interview was the best one of all three. It was with a very
young man who was fresh out of college. He was smart, he was handsome, and
he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. Steve
was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question: "Do
you notice anything different about me?" And to his suprise, the young man
answered: Yes, you wear contact lenses. Steve was shocked, and said, "What
an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that? The
young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, "Well its
pretty hard to wear glasses with no f---ing ears!!!"

1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

Sara, try the instructions below in Lotusnotes.  The name of the database is New Power Contracts.  If you can't open it, you will need to go through eRequest to get access.

How to open the database in Notes:
Go to File...Database...Open
Server = ECTHOU_LN1
FileName = North_America\Swap.nsf
Click [Open]

I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

Rhonda,

I just checked Harlan's computer and he still does not have the icon for our much beloved database.   Can you advise me on what to do and please don't call the database police on me.  Also, Travis McCullough should also get access as well as Steve Hall in Portland.

Thanks for your help,

I wanted to follow up with you to find out if you are still planning to send an example contract to me for transactions involving RMT.  If you plan to send it interoffice mail, I am in EB 1709.

Will there be a checklist for him to use in gathering information from the documents, or should we meet to develop something?

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Jan02 #0201414 for $258,403.20
Nov01 #01121913 for $252,450.03
Dec01 #01122168 for $275,962.03

As we discussed, they said they would send a check and my concern is it went into a lockbox or possibly the wrong account.  They may have paid and it could be difficult for us to see the payment.  Let me know if you uncover anything.

The files that were given to me have been reassigned within the group.  I resolved Morgan Stanley Cap Group and sent a signed global confirmation acceptance  to Todd D.  As to EES, I was working with Sarah Dietrich, attorney with EES, but could never get them to execute since officers would not do so on the basis of the internal "reorg" issues.  Sarah was going to continue to work on this.

Looks like more counterparties are thinking about netting.  See below.   Under the current circumstances, is our procedure going to be sending out our newly developed master to all counterparties looking to enter into netting arrangements?

Thanks,

Our 3/4/02 demand letter only included a Feb02 invoice.  NPC responded that they had already made payment and our investigation proved the same.  Going through the ARRedList I see that we have NPC delinquent on a Jan02 invoice in the amount of $1,694,770.00.  Before I call NPC please make a search of our systems to verify that they have not paid.

This request to open a brokerage account is in connection with ENA's sale of Hanover Compressor Company Common Stock .  The transaction involves several components.  We are being asked to open a brokerage account with Bear Stearns International Limited so that Bear is able to obtain favorable tax treatment on the specific types of transactions that we are doing.  We are attempting to enter into these transactions on a "one-off" basis to avoid negotiating a brokerage agreement that would govern any future transactions.

Gil:

Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

Tom and Bjorn:  Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

Alan:  Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Thanks.  SS

Attached hereto are first drafts of the form of swap documents we propose to use in connection with the prepay transaction with Chase and Mahonia.  Since we do not have a Master ISDA in place with Mahonia, I have drafted the ENA/Mahonia confirmation in the form of a "deemed ISDA".  

You will note that the business terms of the swaps as well as the calculation of collateral posting amounts have been left blank.  These will be filled in as soon as the parties have agreed to them.  

Please be advised that none of the members of the business team at Enron have had a chance to review the form of documents attached hereto.  Therefore the documents remain subject to further change based on their input.  

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Gentlemen,

As my voicemail to Rob this evening indicated, we will be sending the documents for your review on Sunday afternoon.  They will not have the transaction specifics (pricing etc) as our model is being finalized now that we received your approval.   I also want to speak with Jeff on Monday about it.  However, there is enough boilerplate to review and comment on as necessary in the interim.

The plan is to have documents at least 90% finalized by end of day on Tuesday; have a dry run on Wed so we have time to adjust calculations, etc.; close and fund on Thursday.

We look forward to successfully executing another transaction with Chase.

If you need to reach me this weekend you may leave me a message at work - 713 853 1703; or at home - 713 426 5705.

Regards, Lisa

PS.  It would be very helpful to receive the requested Mahonia information and signoff on Monday or at least let us know that it is all ok and will be delivered on time.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

Dear Sara

I am responding to you whilst Daniel Harris is out of the office.

In reference to Arbitration, we can agree to Arbitration in the English
Courts.

Daniel will contact you tomorrow in reference to the remaining points.

I look forward to receiving the outstanding documentation.

Kind regards

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
If you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
and we can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
Chamber of Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
non-prime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
therefore, are not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.
We do have other business relationships with GSI and again request
inclusion of limitation of liability language in the terms of business
letter.  I propose:

"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
executed together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

Subject:	FIMAT Canada, Inc. Customer Agreement

Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.  A few things for you to note and we can chat quickly:

(1)  Par. 5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or "as agreed to from time to time"? [Glover, Sheila]    AGREED "from TIme to time" okay.  We are requesting commission fee schedule.  We will want to have before we sign.  [Glover, Sheila]  I have requested. 

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?
[Glover, Sheila]  We think the max legal rate or 150% sounds high.  We want to see the interest rate schedule.  I will request. 

(3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?
[Glover, Sheila]  We have already ticked it off on the application as a hedge account so language should be extraneous.

(4)  Par. 14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)? [Glover, Sheila]    Trade differences are identified over the phone during as part of the daily broker check-out process.

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

I know it is a bit old but cannot recall the exact date.  Could you please let Sara know the date and who exactly prepared the valuation (I am talking about the MTM you sent me).

Also, please let Sara know all your contact info.

I have made the suggested corrections and made a few minor adjustments to the format of the Deferred Premium Commodity Cap you were working on.  Please note that the Premium Payment Date is on the first page to indicate that such premium is deferred until settlement and calcuated in accordance with the Cash Settlement Amount provisions.  

After review of the structure it occurred to me that this transaction could be drafted as a modified fixed basis swap.  The swap format is much simpler to document and easier to understand the respective payment obligations.  It might make it easier for the counterparty to follow the intended payment obligations.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,
Brent


The first document is the swap format and the second is the revised cap format.

Sara,

I noticed that Citibank has sent in letters terminating their ISDA agreement, as well as a letter terminating their foreign exchange contracts.  Wouldn't the FX confirms be covered by the ISDA?  We certainly confirmed them as if they were.  

The date of the letter terminating FX confirms is 12/2/01, while the ISDA was terminated 12/3/01.

I think London is now saying they merely need to set up an accounting entity within ECTEF.  Should we need to move forward with the new account afterall I will happily send out the request.

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

Could I suggest that we arrange a meeting with a single representative from each function: credit, commercial, legal, tax, and EOL?

Credit has planned a quick meeting to establish our position/proposal.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Are multiparty ISDAs a real option ? This seems like the simplest solution.

If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.

With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).

Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.

To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost).

Janine

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will receive termination letters today.  Several CPs have outstanding issues which we are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been paid).  Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the following CPs.  Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from "live" to "terminated."

Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
-----------------------------		-------
Johns Manville Int'l.		$8.6
Kerr-McGee En. Servs. Corp.	$3.6
Virginia Power			$9.3
Whirlpool Corp.			$0.2
	Total			$21.7

Please note that this list may change over the course of the day as we continue our research and issue resolution on each CP.  Additionally, the MTM values may be different once the positions are valued at the appropriate termination date.

Don, the above is slightly different from the CPs I provided verbally earlier today.

On item no. 1, as you and I just confirmed with Michelle Bruce, the $958,000 owed by Vitol to EGLI due on 11/29/01 has not been paid. We are pulling the sale confirmation to see what the payment terms are. I have left a voice mail for Tom Moran who was travelling to NY today to learn where the l/c is so it can be reviewed for drawing requirements. We'll have to revisit about this on Wednesday, Dec 26 assuming we hear back from Tom.

Is there anyone else from Credit who can get us access to the l/c?

Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this morning:

1.	Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has paid Enron.  I have not heard from Mark or Tom.  The LC expires on 12/28.

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to contact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Credit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give them until Wednesday to renew.

6.	Niagra Mohawk/ENA, Metromedia energy/ENA, Simpson Tacoma/ENA, The Energy Authority/ENA, Energy Production/ENA, Rising Star Energy LLC/ENA - I am waiting on payment history info from Leslie to see if we have any right to draw.   Could someone in credit confirm that we are in-the-money on all of these?

7.	City of Santa Clara - Harlan to send out default notice.

Sara,
Thanks for your suggested changes.  I left the commercial support requirement on the account because I think it is a good control.  However, if you do want to remove this requirement because of shrinking staffs,  I am okay with that.  
Please change as required, initial and circulate for signatures.
Thanks. Sheila

Importance:	High

Bryan,

Deuthsche Bank served a credit notice to ECT Investments Inc. for the "triplets" trade.  This trade is not ECT Investments Inc.'s.  All the Credit business was transferred to Enron North America on November 2000 and the Credit book was transferred to Enron Credit Inc. in February 2001.  This trade should not be in ECT Investments Inc.'s name and should have been transferred by Enron Credit.

I would expect Enron Credit Inc. to settle the financial liablility of this trade and not leave it as an obligation to ECT Investments, Inc.

My understanding is that the obligation is around $800,000.

Please advise.

Regards,
Sheila

Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick start signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you had to do for me.

I spoke w/ Brian Russo today to determine whether he sent payment as he indicated on 3/13/02.  He admitted that BG&E dropped the ball and would get the payment via wire to ENA tomorrow.  He also said there are a few invoices wherein ENA owes BG&E.  If they are all post-petition he is planning to net the amounts.

I provided Brian w/ wire instructions.  

Brian again stated he is willing to pay default interest when the rate is provided.  That issue is in my court.

Susan: DLL update please.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Do we always post Margin in USD? The FIMAT Canada Account will have Canadian Dollar Activity in it. The account says that margin is held in the underlying currency.
Are you okay with this?

Features/Toxic Bonds
Headed For A Fall ; Companies issued special zero-coupon bonds, assuming th=
ey'd never have to pay them off. Now shareholders could be on the hook for =
a $65 billion tab.
Janice Revell

11/26/2001
Fortune Magazine
Time Inc.

(Copyright 2001)

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could "put" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. "This is a ticking time bomb," warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. "If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody," says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p," says Cohen. "They don't worry about the bond getting put."=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. "We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int," says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. "Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down," Kelly says. "I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world," notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They're getting bad advice=
," claims one banker who didn't want to be named. "Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. "It's an incredible deal for them," says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage."=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around," says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=
ing the bill.=20
FEEDBACK: jrevell@fortunemail.com=20
The bill comes due=20
Companies issued convertible zeros, with put features, when the stock marke=
t soured. Now repayment looms.=20

When zero is a negative number=20
The danger posed by convertible zero bonds depends on a number of factors, =
according to Morgan Stanley's ConvertBond.com: the size of the bond, the pu=

 must rise for the bond to convert to equity.=20

Carson,

I talked to Sara last week after a shameful several months of no contact.  We
decided that the three of us need to get together to celebrate her birthday
again (last Saturday) and start with a bottle of Cakebread.  Either Wednesday or
Thursday of this week or Monday of next week would work for me.    Sara's
schedule for the next couple of weeks was clear.  How about yours?  Pick a date
for a wonderful evening with two young, beautiful and sexy women.  (We'll find
them somewhere - or pick a date for an alternative evening with Sara and me!)

Donna

Hi Sara:

Just a note to let you know that I will do my part to consume your
excess wine even though Enron is experiencing such difficult times. That
is the kind of guy I AM. I am sure that Donna will do her part also.

I am off to New Orleans to spend Thanksgiving Day at the Fair Grounds
Race Track. I might even see Monty. I hope you and your family have a
wonderful day.

Keep your head up,

Carson

The company for which the account needs to be set up is:

ECT Europe Finance Inc. (company 030S).

I believe that this company's constitutional docs are held in Houston - and my guess is that the authorized officers are also in Houston.  I suggest that you liaise with the company secretarial department in Houston (Kate Cole) to resolve this.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

Edmund

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help
Kathryn

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

     "Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable
     efforts to promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice

Please confirm this is now acceptable.

Christine -
Sara is out of the office for the rest of the week, but I understand why 
you guys have trouble with me specifically being listed.  Instead of my 
number being put in there, can we just use the general Enron Corp phone 
number (1-800-973-6766) and have UBS ask to be connected to the 
Treasurer's office.  There will always be a person there to take the 
call, and you will always be directed to the right person regardless of 
what employee reassignments may occur between now and then.
     
Jim, what do you think of this?  Christine, since Sara is out, would you 
please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list.  Thanks.

Sara,
     
Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations 
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of 
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented. 
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any 
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the 
termination notice would not be effective.
     
We propose to insert the following language instead:
     
     
        "Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts 
to 
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by 
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party, 
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway 
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile 
transmission."
     
     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under 
"Additional 
     Termination Event".)
     
Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new 
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round 
of signatures.
     
Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any 
inconvenience this may cause.
     
Regards,
Christine

Sara and Donna,
Gary has agreed that the Convertible Arbitrage Book should be transferred back to ECT Investments Inc. The Convertible Arbitrage Book was moved from ECT Investments, Inc. to Enron North America Corp., effective 1QTR2001.  

We will need to get this done before year-end.  The Convertible Book will need to be reported at year-end for SEC 13F reporting.  We want it included in ECT Investments' 13f  rather than do a ENA filing.

Theresa is calling GS and MSDW to see what they will require.

Gary,

Have you had a chance to think about this?

Farzad says it does not matter to him whether he trades as ENA, ECT Investments or XXX.

One important thing I just thought about is that I do not think we would want the Convertible Arbitrage Book Trading in London as Enron North America Corp.  Whether we are trading from London or Houston, our counterparties will be the same on Convertible Arbitrage Trading though the %s may change.  We use the Agent, Enron Investment Services Limited in London, to trade on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  

Thanks,
Sheila

How strongly do you feel about not having the Convertible Arbitrage Book in ECT Investments?

We could move the Convertible Arbitrage Book back into ECT Investments before year-end.  Otherwise, we will need to do SEC 13f reporting for ENA.  

My concern would be:
Enron may not want to disclose certain positions in the Merchant Portfolio which are in the name of ENA.  We would need to include in the reporting all ENA Longs, long puts and long calls  >$200,000.  I am not sure how much we actually have in the name of Enron North America.
Does Enron want to do a SEC 13F with the Enron North America name and address?

If we move to a totally separate entity, we will need to set up new Prime Broker (2)  and Executing Broker Agreements (27)  for the new entity.

The return on capital can continue to be calculated based upon selected books.  

Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
This would be ENA.  I want to talk to Shane because it says "JP Morgan online FX system" but the agreement is with Chase.  With Chase, we would only be requesting Online trading functionality for an existing counterparty relationship.

Sara,

Attached is the initial draft of the term sheet prepared by Bear Stearns for use in connection with Project Bruin. I hope that the e-mails I am forwarding to you are sufficient to give you an idea of the nature and intended accomplishments of the exercise.

Now that I am re-reading the message from Tom Blair of Bear Stearns, I see that he intended to follow up with additional detailed term sheets. I will ask whether those have been provided to us and forward them to you in the event we have them.

Paul

Kevin,

Please find following an indicative term-sheet for your/team's review.
While there are three simultaneous trades occuring at the same time, Davis
wanted one term-sheet to use for your internal conversations for simlplicity
sake.  We will have additional term-sheets available for all three
components of the trade tomorrow.  I will make sure you have a summary pitch
book available to discuss the merits/risks of the trade by Friday.  

Speak with you in the am.

Best.

Tom

Are you working on Bruin?  Davis Thames told me Kristina Mordaunt is leading, but if involves ENA ISDA makes sense for you to be working with them on that portion.

I received a phone call from Nancy Bauer with Bear Stearns International Ltd. ("Bear Stearns").  Nancy has  informed me that Bear Stearns will be doing a large trade with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") very soon.  Their goal is to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place quickly.  Bear Stearns would like for the ISDA Master Agreement with ENA to mirror the ISDA Master Agreement dated July 3, 2000 between Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns.   

My review of our Lotus Notes database did not reveal that Enron Credit Limited has a Master Agreement with Bear Stearns.  If this Master Agreement has been executed, please make an entry for it in Lotus Notes.  Also, please e-mail me a copy of the execution version of the Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns Master Agreement for legal and credit in Houston to review.  Since time is of the essence, your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Per Carol St. Clair, at this time, there is no urgency in finalizing and executing any master netting agreements.  No master netting agreement should be signed without Bill Bradford's or Louise Kitchen's prior approval.  If any questions, please contact either Carol or Elizabeth Sager.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

Subject:	Greenfield - ECTRI Loan Note

Peter,

The details of the promissory note ("Loan Note 2002") from Greenfield to ECTRI in payment of agreed interest rate swap breakage costs in connection with the November 2001 Greenfield equity sale/LAKSHMI vessel financing workout transaction are as follows:

Maker: 			Greenfield Shipping Company Limited
Holder:			Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
Guarantor: 		Mitsui OSK Lines, Ltd.
Date of Note: 		November 20, 2001
Principal Amount:	US$12,720,000.00
Interest Rate: 		5% per annum (based on 360 day year)
ECTRI Swap Deal No.:	M148198

Repayment Schedule*:
	1st Payment:	January 31, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	2nd Payment:	February 28, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	3rd Payment:	March 29, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	Final Payment:	April 30, 2002 -- remaining balance of principal plus accrued interest.

	* Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Loan Note is repayable in full upon refinancing of the vessel by Greenfield. 

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I'm copying Enron lawyers Alan Aronowitz and Sara Shackleton on this note so that they are also aware of the details of this ECTRI receivable and the fact that MOL appear to be arranging payment on behalf of Greenfield to ECTRI (at least for the January and February 2002 instalment obligations).

Kind regards,
Dan Rogers

Please let me know your comments.

Sara and Marie,
Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.  

MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.

As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.

Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.

Please advise.
Sheila

Bill and Ed:
On 12/21, we received a letter from Entergy-Koch stating that their calculation of the Final Settlement Amount under the Master Netting Agreement results in a payment from them to Enron of $10,384,673.  They are awaiting payment instructions.

Can we verify this amount?

Lisa,

If we are okay with this amount, can they pay it to us without getting E&*Y's approval?

Sorry that I did not get around to talk with you both but if Bob Bruce could pick up the financial side of EIM, that would be a big help to Cheryl.  Bob, please talk with Steve VanHooser for transition.  Let me know if there are questions etc.

Cheryl:

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Thanks.  Sara

Per,

Robert Hunzinger from Owensboro gave me a call this morning to find out the status of his contingent call option with Enron.  

I told him that since ENA was one of the bankrupt entities, that it would be highly unlikely that he would get paid if his option were to strike this summer.  His determination period is June 17, 2002-August 30, 2002.  

Not sure if you'd like to give Robert a call or not, just wanted to let you know that he had called in regarding his swap.

Sara--I gave Robert you name and numbers in case he wanted to talk to an attorney, or send in a letter terminating the transaction.

Jackie,

Legal is reviewing the Terms of Business document for Credit Lyonnais and Monument Derivatives.

For Equities and Options, we will trade as ECT Investments, Inc.  with all clearing through Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley & Co.

For Futures, we will trade as Enron North America Corp. with Give-up to Carr Futures and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc. We are currently in the process of setting up the Deutsche Bank agreement.  Rob Manders, 212-469-2034, Rob.Manders@db.com,  may be contacted for more information.

Legal thought that for the futures we only require your give-up agreements to Carr and DB and will not need the Terms of Business Agreement on the Futures side.

Please advise.
Sheila

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forwa=
rd to others in your group.
=20
Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D=
iabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) walk.  This year the walk will be held o=
n Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall.
=20
As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that=
 is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty=
pe 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes. =
 The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often =
be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Ev=
ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times=
, in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Jus=
t think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee=
dle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I ha=
ve to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagin=
e what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  B=
ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every we=
ek for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never =
take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their =
food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the =
proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead =
to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among =
other complications.
=20
I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort=
s with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committ=
ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo=
r this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have =
a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husban=
d has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to=
 diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I =
have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes.
=20
I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi=
s year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the p=
eople in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from prev=
ious groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron.
=20
Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak=
e this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have =
not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities=
 that are available to give your support to this important effort:
Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the collecti=
ng and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.  Based on the d=
onations raised by your group, you may also be eligible for prizes availabl=
e only to team leaders.  If you are interested in becoming a team leader, p=
lease contact me right away so that I may get the team leader information a=
nd materials to you.=20
Walkers.  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, I will m=
ake sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDRF walk i=
s a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All walkers a=
re asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a great T-shir=
t to wear the day of the walk.=20
Supporters.  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the walk on =
October 28th, then please sign up as a supporter by sending a return e-mail=
 with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October for col=
lection of the donation.=20
The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure!  The J=
uvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dol=
lar that is donated to JDRF, over 85 cents goes directly to research.  In a=
ddition, this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar.
=20
Thank you for your support, time and efforts.  And please, let's Walk to Cu=
re Diabetes!

Sara,

Looks like we never received the forward confirmations.   We did receive the
put confirmations, which were received last week.

Please have the forward confirmations faxed to me today at 646-758-4819.

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.  On October 9th, I forwarded an email to you requesting your review of that language that we received from Brent Hendry.  I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.
Please let me know what changes are necessary.

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Sara,

Thought you might find this useful.  We've added in the valuation we showed in Infinity for each of our counterparties (Clara ran the valuations as off the Early Termination date referenced in the log).  Please let me know if you have questions.  Thanks.

We have sent the first draft of an ISDA with EFET LLC to Deutsche Bank, which mirrored the terms of the Enron NA ISDA with English law amendments.

Are you happy for me to negotiate the ECTRIC ISDA on the same terms with English law amendments? I will run it past tax and credit again. We will be wanting gas as well as lc's in the CSA for both.

Credit think Steve will want a MAC clause which we want to avoid and they have asked me to stall him so I haven't called him back yet but I will tomorrow.

Thanks.
Anna

Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed

approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

After discussions with Elizabeth Sager and Leslie Hansen, we have developed a few additions to the EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment form to clarify that (1) neither party shall (not just that neither party is required to) send paper confirms, and (2) the transaction's records on EOL control over any conflicting terms in the underlying Governing Agreement. I have attached a draft below of a Consent and Agreement for Idacorp with the proposed changes in italics (see Para. 1(a)(i) and 3). We made this last change in anticipation of revised EOL power product definitions, which new definitions will conflict with important terms (such as the force majeure clause) in the Power Master.  If you don't want any of these proposed changes to be made to the form as a whole, and would prefer that they be handled in the Power Annex so as to apply only to Power, please let me know.

as discussed attached is a cleaned up redlined version of the schedule.  as
you know, there are still several open issues, but hopefully, it will be
easier to work from this document.  in the meantime, i will work on
redlining the csa and reviewing some of the open issues in the schedule that

Sorry to miss you just now - I seem to have gotten lost in your voicemail
system as well.

I am pretty much tied up this afternoon and out on Monday.  Can we try to
talk first thing Tuesday morning?

Regards.

I just received two letters from IR dated 12/6/01 and 2/1/02 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on Elliot Bonner's desk.  IR is terminating Commodity Swap Y810701 and demanding payment from ENA.

Kevin, can you please confirm that Y810701 is the only active financial swap between the two parties?  If it is not, then we cannot reflect that IR has terminated its swap(s).  We will also need

The meeting is at 1:00 p.m. today.  Aaron, if you come to my office we will walk over to Sara's office and have the meeting there.

I have spoken to Francisco and got a good data dump from him - - there is no need for him to join us this afternoon.  I have the trader's name - - we should call him during our meeting.

In order to move forward we need three things:

		1. 	The PwC valuation of the financial contracts;
		2.	A better understanding of the physical contracts and what happened;
		3.	A good data dump from the trader.

Once we have this information we should approach SDGE.  Let's aim at having "first contact" tomorrow morning.

Notice No. 02-61
	February 21, 2002


	TO:		ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
			ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS
			ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

	FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

		RE:  		Accurate Reporting of Open Interest by
Clearing
				Members

		Exchange rules require clearing members to carry all
customer accounts accurately at the clearinghouse.  The previous three
monthly contract expirations for NYMEX energy futures has shown open
interest on the business day following the (EFP only session) for crude oil
and the products, and discrepancies in open interest as compared to delivery
notices for natural gas and propane.  The Exchange attributes this
overstating of open interest to incorrect reporting of gross positions by
clearing members and thus a failure to bring down these positions at the
clearinghouse in a timely manner, i.e., by the 10:00 a.m. Exchange cutoff
time for open interest calculation.

		 As a reminder, clearing members are required to process, on
a daily basis, correct open interest figures.  NYMEX Rule 9.04(P) - Clearing
Procedure, states, in pertinent part, that "(1) concurrent long and short
positions in the current delivery month may not be offset by netting,
transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping procedures, but each
side must be offset by normal floor transactions in accordance with Exchange
Rules.  Provided however, that a clearing member will be exempt from this
requirement if: (i) one side of the concurrent position is established the
business day prior to the date... [of] the offset [adjustment]...with the
Clearing House...

		(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current
delivery month for energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading
on the third business day prior to the respective futures contract,
including the termination date.  "

		Therefore, for concurrent positions established within this
three-day period, position adjustments must be processed via the C-21
terminals no later than 10:00 a.m. on the following business day, (including
the business day following contract termination), in order to correctly
reflect open interest in the expiring contract month.

		If you have any questions concerning this matter, please
contact Nick Galati at (212) 299-2920, Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919 or
Bonnie Yurga at (212) 299-2879.

Bill:
Here is what Enserco is willing to do:

They are willing to extend the term of the $million LC to January 31st if we agree to extend the January due dates on settlement payments for physical gas and financial trades to January 31st.  They believe that they have a good argument against our right to declare an Event of Default based on their failure to renew and the LC will expire on 12/31.  It is questionable under the ISDA whether they are required to renew while we are in default.

Leslie:

I need to know what payments are owed in December and January between ENA and Enserco for physical gas and financial trades under the ISDA.

Lisa, Julia and Lou:
Would EY need to approve this?

if the margin was a letter of credit and the contract has been terminated and we agree that we owe them money and letter of credit only covers that contract so could not draw if they owed us other money somewhere else, i think we will need to return. my view as to cash is likely to be different and thinking about that. do you all agree re the letter of credit??

Are you looking solely for Enron Corp. executory contracts?

We can identify the Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements (which are safe harbor contracts under the Code) as well as securities contracts (also safe harbor contracts).  Please be a bit more specific.

Thanks.  Sara

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

We are way in the money on JEDI2.  Should we terminate on them for non-payment and try to get the money from them?

Ms. Lemont:

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc. signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.  Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the corporate documentation?

The defined terms in the EEI Master and other Master Agreements on the Power side are generic so probably good to have them included and this still enables us to maintain a generic form.
In the older Master Agreements the only difference is in respect of the relevant Section reference and sometimes "termination Payment" is referred to as "Early Termination Payment".

Aaron,

Please find attached our proposed futures and options commission schedule for Enron Corporation. Although you will be trading mainly European interest rate futures, I have included an exhaustive list of contracts and exchanges in Europe, N America and Asia Pacific. Take note that all proposed clearing rates include exchange fees. This explains why Eurex is cheaper than both LIFFE and US exchanges as they charge lower exchange fees. In the columns moving across the spreadsheet from left to right, you will see our proposed execution fee, and clearing fee followed by a full service rate. We have provided a discount on the full service rate to encourage you to use Deutsche Bank for both execution and clearing of exchange traded products. Finally you will find a column headed Ex-Link FS. This represents the full service rate if you use our electronic execution platform (Exchange Link).

I hope this proposal meets your approval. If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me

                                                  (See attached file: C07sept2001.xls)

I invite you to get back to me at your earliest convenience to tell me how (or if) you would like to take this forward.


Regards

Bill, Cassandra, and Donna,

Please reply to this mail with your approval of the signing of the below documents which are needed to maintain an account that had previously been in use by ECT/ENA for execution of Bond Trades through prime broker acocunts.

As Enron Credit has now split out into its own entity new documents must be provided to the executing brokers.

Since we were trading in the old name prior with the counterparties this has only recently come up.  It is now disrupting our trading ability as vital couterparties have been restricted from further transactions with us.

Can we have a blanket approval to set up all bond counterparties registered with ECT/ENA to be set up for ECI as well.

Thanks,

Tom Doukas

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Note:  Yesterday, Berry Petroleum was wanting to negotiate.  Today they signed the letter as it stands with no changes.
Also, see note on Newton Financial Corporation.  I will send Newton a copy of their confirmation as they are requesting.  I will also forward copies of their response letter to you as well as legal.

Sara-

I have spoken with Mary Cook this morning and she has informed me that we will need to add some additional language into the netting agreements to be entered into with Morgan Stanley for the purposes of certain contemplated financings. 

I'll keep you informed as to our progress.

Thanks,

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

I talked w/ Ed McMichael about Noble WRT rescinding our termination if Noble were willing to pay in full all amounts due.  Ed said he would rather cause the position to be terminated (moving the approximately $40M MTM value out of the "live" status) than he would collect the $39M of outstanding invoices.  Ed's rationale is that any amounts settled (invoiced) will ultimately be collected in full w/ interest so there's no need to continue to wear the $40M MTM risk.

Therefore, I will let our termination letter stand as issued and do not plan to contact Noble.

Susan: please be sure to note that the termination letter was sent 3/11/02.

Sara - there are outstanding issues in this table.  I am trying to determine the following today:
Does the Paribas loan cover initial and variation margin?  My reading of the docs is that the loan does.  The back office tells me that Paribas only funds initial margin under this loan.
How much is EDF's loan for?  The number has been reduced and I am not sure where it stands.  
Documentation for Fimat Customer Agreement.

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating =
with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to=
 compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the e=
nd of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this aftern=
oon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our =
rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankr=
uptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when=
 in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afte=
rnoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with=
 Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under =
the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of th=
e expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can d=
eclare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination pay=
ment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the=
 cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  Tha=
t's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

At long last my ship has come in. Another evening with not one but the two most beautiful, sexy, intelligent,
elegant, open mined, ( shall I say more ) women in Houston. How I have patiently waited and emailed to no
avail for such a night. I have a select bottle of Cakebread that was to be consumed by you and me on your
birthday, back in July.  Can we consume it to celebrate both you and Sara's birthdays?

I am going out of town tomorrow but will be back in town late Wednesday. So lets get together this Thursday.
I can not wai. We can go to Le Vista again and bring our own wine or anywhere else you two want to go. But I
do want to consume this bottle of Cakebread, and I have some other bottles that I can throw in also.

Thanks so much for putting this together. I have missed seeing you both.

Carson

Sara

apologies for the delay in replying but today is my first day back after vacation. The agreement is standard as far as SFA references are concerned. In relation to your specific points:
1. Technically we could insist on best execution but would not normally do so. It is likely that we would have to pay more by way of commission if we were to insist.
2. The "further assurance" language is not as useful as a power of attorney but may prove helpful
3. The standard LIFFE terms are a requirement of the LIFFE rules.
4. The CFDs probably could be documented under an ISDA. It would be worth liaising with Monument's counsel on this point.

Regards.

Jonathan

Jonathan:

The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:

page 2	-	2.2
page 4	-	4.2
page 5	-	7.3
page 10	-	12.5
page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III)
Page 18-	7.9

Also, I'm uncertain of the following:

page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright?

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Good Afternoon, 
        Credit has an issue with Texex Energy Partners that you should be aware of.  We received an amendment of an LC that reduces the coverage amount to $4mm and extends the expiry date to 1/15/02.  It covers physical MTM which we are in the money approx $2mm.  I assume that we are not performing on these contracts (some go out to 6/02), but Texex has not terminated.  I believe we should call Texex to extend the LC to protect the value of these contracts and if they refuse, we terminate and draw on the current LC.  Do you buy into this strategy?  Please advise at your convenience.

Thanks, 

Max Sonnonstine

Regarding the proposed language in 2(c), I would recommend that such provision be modified so that if SunTrust is a party to any new credit agreement, the covenants contained therein would govern the swap agreement going forward.  Since chances are good that SunTrust will continue to be a lender, this modification would obviate the need to monitor FGT's compliance with potentially inconsistent terms between the old and new credit agreements.  If SunTrust ceases to be a party to FGT's credit agreement prior to the maturity date of the swap, then the terms and conditions in effect at the time of SunTrust's withdrawal would apply prospectively.

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft
Credit Support Annex (similar in form to the one previously executed with

leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  

Scary, hunh?

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.  

Thanks.  Sara

Sheila,

At this time, there are no updates to report on deferred compensation since the bankruptcy filing.  As you know, the assets of the plan(s) are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.  Thus, no distributions (current or future) can be made.  We sent a letter to you on December 10th with your 11/30/01 balance in the event that you wished to file a claim with the bankruptcy court for your deferral benefit.  We also indicated that the Company would explore options with its creditors to seek approval to restart the deferral plan(s).  To my knowledge, these talks have not begun.  However, I will see if I can find out any additional information to pass on to you.

On the December 10, 2001 letter we indicated that we would forward your "Life to Date Deferrals" at a later date.  This follow-up letter should be sent out to you next week.

Renee

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Subject:	FW: Put Confirmations:  ENE as "Seller" and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. as "Buyer" (or "Lehman")

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

Mark

My NY colleagues have asked me to put somefurther suggestions to you on the
agreement.  Could you please let me have your feedback.

The reason for the changes are:

1.   Because we are talking to you on a range of things, we do not want
this non disclosure agreement to taint any other negotiaon process;

2.   If we conclude a deal, presumably we will have something in htere
about confidentiality so that should be left to htat agreement.

My mark up is based on the last one you snet me which is the final one you
sent for execution I think


Regards

Paul Rogerson

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fire drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

I know you guys are managing the EY relationship and I just wanted to let you know how she's bouncing.

Pursuant to the below email and our discussions today, pls find attached the list forward by Todd Delahoussaye, Financial Deal Compliance, which includes all the deals entered into with Morgan Stanley Capital Group. The deal no is QH4715. 

I am also forwarding you the confirms which we have executed with CSFB and MS, last year, which I had earlier forwarded to Bob last week. 

The contact person at CSFB is James Moran. His email address is james.moran@csfb.com

We still have to hear from CSFB whether they can provide a tax rep on their Cayman Islands entity. As per my understanding, that is the only relevant credit issue for this transaction. 

Looking forward to hearing from you on the confirms necessary for the roll-over. Could you give me a call sometime later today, when you have finished going through them. 

Thanks & Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Rob/ Sara, 

As indicated in the other email of today, Todd has sent me a separate list which Morgan Stanley sent to Enron. I have gone through the list and this particular deal is indeed there. The confirms for this particular deal were sent by me sometime last week (both the CSFB and the MS confirms). Will call today to discuss further. 

Thanks

 Todd,

The Deal number for the below deal is QH4715.  Can you tell me if it is included in the list Morgan sent back to you?


Raj,
Morgan does not actually sign and return documents per the Master Agreement.  They send a reply type of message which states that they agree to a certain deal number or numbers.  Todd will let us know if this particular deal has been agreed to in this manner.
FYI, today is my last day in this group.  Going forward you can contact Diane Anderson for anything related to Confirmations.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Larry, 

You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 

Thanks & Regards

Sheila - As far as proving the money belongs to Credit, have we had anything back from
Goldmans on docs opening a new ECI bank account? From Credit Trading's perspective,
I think we can demonstrate that ENA had no economic interest in this account:

- Credit traders directed all of the trading activity in this account
- all trading positions and P&L were reported in Credit's DPR and in Enron Credit Inc
- all margin requirements were funded from Credit's Citibank account in London

  
Thanks
Simon

Sheila - Attached are revised faxes to send to Bears and MSDW - could you co-ordinate signatures in the US again,
or would you like Bryan and Markus to sign? I have changed the MSDW and Bears payments to pay into Enron Credit
Limited's account at Citibank.

We have $10,924,975.00 in the main ECI account, and $630,258.41 in the ECTEF Inc account, and have asked for
$10.9m and $0.6m to be paid to Citibank. We also have some more funds coming into the account from the sale of
Loral bonds & MLM shares on Tuesday or Wednesday. We can move these amounts when the trades have settled.

Can you ask Bears to let us know as early as possible on Monday whether they will be able to pay the money over?

Thanks
Simon

Subject:	Bear Stears Wire requests of 12/14/01

Mary, Bryan and Simon,

Bear was able to get out the $3.9 million to ECT Investments out to us via fed wire.

The two wires for Enron Credit Inc. and ECT Europe Finance Inc. were via Swift which has an earlier cut-off.   Additionally, Mike Nierva said that the wire requests were not in good form.  He said his wire department usually sees a US bank with a FOR FURTHER CREDIT to the foreign bank. 

I would appreciate some help in getting this revised to send to Bear Stearns early on Monday.  

Mike Nierva is consolidating the balances in the main account,  102-25786-2-7.  Additionally, he completed the FX trades today.

I also need this for MSDW for the $131,000 wire request.  MSDW has a policy not to send money to foreign banks.

Thanks. Sheila

We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.

In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
We are okay with this. 

They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.

Please call me if I can be of assistance.

Sheila,

We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

(See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)

Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.

Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

Francisco,

Enervest Energy & Enervest Management are two counterparties ENA has NG hedges on with.  These hedges extend until the year 2004 (approximately) and ENA is "out of the money" (we owe them).  The customer has requested that the year 2002 portion of the hedges be extended until the year 2003.  We would do this transaction at a price that leaves ENA's exposure to the counterparties unchanged.  ENA's exposure to the counterparties is 5,355,728 as 12/11/01 and it would be the same after the change.  The customer wants to do this to "buy time to let the bankruptcy settle out" (right or wrong).  This would be a good thing for ENA because it defers cash flows and also the market could turn around in the future.

The attached file contains the MTM of the counterparties deals as of 12/11/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
George N Gilbert (X5222)

Also give me your analysis wherein the Counterparty receivable financing is=
 more generic, without specific references to contracts but a global refere=
nce to receivables in connection with a product type, and assume representa=
tions by Counterparty to Bank that do not include setoff rights as any type=
 of "permitted encumbrance or charge."  Would the Bank still be put on reas=
onable inquiry vis a vis the Enron position?

 Draft of Master Netting

Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form reg=
arding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our s=
chedule.

(g)=09Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early T=
ermination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in eith=
er case, "X") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any=
 amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, "Y=
") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this A=
greement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), =
any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's A=
ffiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obliga=
tion) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o=
r undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respe=
ct of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent o=
f any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y noti=
ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t=
he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a=
ffect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, "Owed" sha=
ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh=
ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat=
ion Date.
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by=
 X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat=
e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, =
would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert=
ed.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o=
bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa=
rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in=
 this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter=
est except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision =
shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting=
, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi=
ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by=
 operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents =
and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral =
part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the=
 parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the part=
ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i=
tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of=
 its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio=
n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr=
eement as it relates to this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme=
nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha=
ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo=
unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party=
 receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi=
ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any=
 kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her=
ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay=
ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil=
iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o=
r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha=
ve been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=
 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's "priority" position (assumin=
g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=
 rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof=
f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h=
as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
=20
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen=
t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=
 may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste=
r agreement and transactions "as security".  Please review and advise of an=
y particular language you think should be added. =20

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p=
rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the=
 end of 7(b), ";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje=
ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all =
rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section]."

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master nettin=
g agreement?

Sara,

It has been brought to my attention that the payment language we are using for financial power trades that are less than one month in duration does not mention that payment is due 5 business days after the floating price is determinable.  It basically says 5 business days after the last day of the month.

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period of one month or longer).

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Period (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period less than one month).


Can you draft payment language for trades less than one month that states payment is due five business days after the floating price is determinable?

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Melissa

Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:

1.  "executed"
2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master
3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it
4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master
5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement

Thanks for your attention herewith.

Notice No. 02-49
February 13, 2002



TO:		All NYMEX Division Members/Member Firms
		All NYMEX Division Clearing Members
		All NYMEX Division Floor Traders
		All NYMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	George Henderson, Vice President

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
		Floor and Clearing Members - Revised Hours
________________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Gasoline-Crack
(CGH2) and Heating Oil-Crack (CHH2) is Tuesday, February 19, 2002.


GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or

Sara,  the money was swept from the below BofA account to Enron Corp.'s BofA account 3750494015.  From there it was sent to another Enron Corp account at Citibank 00076486.  Presumably, this is it's final resting place.

Sara, ENA had one trade which matched this amount.  ENA deal number 674047.  

The money came into our account at Bank of America, acct. number 3751443337 account name "Enron Corp--ENA Cash Services"

The money is swept at the end of every day to a Citibank account, which I believe is in the name of Enron corp.  I am verifying with treasury to be sure.  As for the whereabouts of that specific parcel of cash, there's just no telling.  It would have been merged with everything else that gets swept into the account.

Laurel:

Please call me in the morning.  I need to verify:

1.	Was this an ENA transaction?

2.	What is the actual account number?

3. 	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?  I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.  Was this an ENA or ENE account?

4.  	Where is the money today?

Thanks.

In the european csfb prepay which was just extended, morgan stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount. I think csfb was aware of that on the euro prepay. Has it been mentioned yet? Treasa knows the details.

I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly. They have capacity now.

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the
applicable Determination Period."

Are multiparty ISDAs a real option ? This seems like the simplest solution.

If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.

With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).

Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.

To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost). 

Regards
Janine

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

Per,

Robert Hunzinger from Owensboro gave me a call this morning to find out the status of his contingent call option with Enron.  

I told him that since ENA was one of the bankrupt entities, that it would be highly unlikely that he would get paid if his option were to strike this summer.  His determination period is June 17, 2002-August 30, 2002.  

Not sure if you'd like to give Robert a call or not, just wanted to let you know that he had called in regarding his swap.

Sara--I gave Robert you name and numbers in case he wanted to talk to an attorney, or send in a letter terminating the transaction.

Peter,

The details of the promissory note ("Loan Note 2002") from Greenfield to ECTRI in payment of agreed interest rate swap breakage costs in connection with the November 2001 Greenfield equity sale/LAKSHMI vessel financing workout transaction are as follows:

Maker: 			Greenfield Shipping Company Limited
Holder:			Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
Guarantor: 		Mitsui OSK Lines, Ltd.
Date of Note: 		November 20, 2001
Principal Amount:	US$12,720,000.00
Interest Rate: 		5% per annum (based on 360 day year)
ECTRI Swap Deal No.:	M148198

Repayment Schedule*:
	1st Payment:	January 31, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	2nd Payment:	February 28, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	3rd Payment:	March 29, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	Final Payment:	April 30, 2002 -- remaining balance of principal plus accrued interest.

	* Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Loan Note is repayable in full upon refinancing of the vessel by Greenfield. 

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I'm copying Enron lawyers Alan Aronowitz and Sara Shackleton on this note so that they are also aware of the details of this ECTRI receivable and the fact that MOL appear to be arranging payment on behalf of Greenfield to ECTRI (at least for the January and February 2002 instalment obligations).

Kind regards,
Dan Rogers

I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a "unilateral" approach to
include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted by
PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney) and
he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
applied to both of us or neither of us).

Let me know if you need to discuss this further - in which case we will get
on a call (Yair, you and myself) to discuss.

Jim and Gary,
 
I would change the $64 million to $45.6 million for Rate & Currency.  The $45.6 is after consideration of the collateral posted for GSCM. 

I have not included CIBS and J. Aaron which will require more time because it includes trading positions from several other Enron groups and significant collateral has been posted.  If you do want to include, I would list as 3.3 using a pro-rata spread of the collateral and list separately as harder to get.

We have other positive position where Enron is net negative or more collateral has been posted (e.g JPM).

The Broker Deposit number for Equity Trading should be removed.  We only have about 160,000 left to get back currently.

I have asked them to work cooperatively with us and to use copiers on other floors or to send out large jobs to the copy center.  Let me know if the situation does not improve.

fyi:	It has come to my attention that Tana/Marie are making constant use of the xerox for copying the ISDA preprinted form, etc.  Is there a standard for outsourcing these jobs?

John,
Follow-up process discussion.  Again, we have had one new external counterparty this year, CSFB.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila,

Per Legal (Sara Shackleton) and Trading (William Stuart)  the process works as follows:

Trading will call Legal and express a desire to work with a specific bank.  Legal immediately calls credit and gives the counterparty name as well as the types of trades we expect to enter into (FX, IR, long dated, spot).  Legal also puts the wheels in motion on negotiating a Master Agreement.  Credit will (or not) give it's approval for ENA to trade under a "deemed ISDA" format confirmation [long form which outlines credit provisions, netting, setoff, etc]  Legal then communicates back to Trading that they may (or not) begin trading with the counterparty in question.  

In the most recent exampe, CSFB, Stuart called Sara to let her know they wanted to trade with CSFB.  Sara called credit and got their approval to trade using a deemed ISDA format confirmation.  Sara and CSFB negotiated the format for the Deemed ISDA, and then she gave Stuart the go-ahead to trade.  She emailed me the form of confirmation we are to use when documenting trades with CSFB.  At present, the Master Agreement is still under negotiation, but is close to execution.  

Please let me know if you need any additional info.

Carrie,

I've been speaking with Sara Shackleton in Legal and she would prefer if you view the requested contracts in her office (she keeps the files there).  That would avoid duplication of effort (from Laurel Adams and me) and Sara can answer any contract questions better than I can.

Thanks,

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Ed made the point that we need to make sure we have picked up all commodities associated with the contracts we send demand letter for.  I'll talk to Angelo to see if he picked up all commodities.  If not we may need to slow down (unfortunately) in order to sweep the landscape for other commodity unpaid invoices (besides gas).

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Rick - My understanding is you're assuming this function now.  If I do in fact still need to sign, let me know.

Unfortunately CSFB claims to be unable to locate the ENA document.  If we can use our copy they will accept our changes to the ECI document.  We should send both the ENA and the ECI docs so they can compare quickly and avoid additional delays.

This account should be opened asap.  Tom, I assume as per our conversation, that you have obtained the account documentation required and it matches the agreements that have been previously signed, only changing the name of the entity and tax ID number.  All accounts that are used for trading by the debt traders should be changed to Enron Credit Inc.  If I can provide any assistance, please advise.  Donna Lowry, RAC Compliance

This is the primebroker agreement that we need to fill out for CSFB.  They are holding two trades hostage so this is a priority for us.  Please let me know if you require any further information.

To All -

Some weeks ago we initiated the process of amending various agreements with Sempra Energy in order to enable Enron trading entities to confirm transactions with Sempra through CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module.  I understand that little to no communications have been undertaken concerning these amendments.  The reason for the lack of responsiveness by Sempra may be in part due to the fact that Sempra has - just recently - released a product within their internet site that enables online confirmation of Sempra transactions.  This product is part of a suite of portfolio products called "SempraLive" and can be found at www.sempratrading.com.

We are currently looking into the background of the development of this product as some concerns have been raised based upon similarities of certain aspects of the Sempra product and the ConfirmLogic product.

Please let me know if any disussions take place concering the CommodityLogic amendments with Sempra.

Thanks.

Mark

Pat,

Please move the following counterparties from the terminated book to the live book. These are for financial transactions only.
			Hess Energy Services Company, LLC
FLORIDAPOWCOR	Florida Power Corp
MARATHON		Marothon Oil Company
COLUMBIA ENERGY	Columbia Energy Services Corporation	
ALABAMAGASCOR	Alabama Gas Corporation
LAMINADODEBAR	Laminados de Barro, S.A. de C.V


Please move the following from Live to Terminated-Financial only.
		Hess Energy Trading 

Issues:
SUNCORENE 	Suncor Energy Inc. is listed in the Live ENA book....but this counterparty has agreement with Enron Canada. Tagg indicates that all its financial deals are listed with ECC. This CP should be terminated for ECC, but it should never have been included in ENA's books? I am not quite sure where the mix up is...can you help resolve?

The Consumers Gas Company - It looks like this CP does not have agreement with ENA, but does have one with Canada.  ECC financial transactions have been terminated. Can we verify if any financial deals were done under this CP for ENA? Consumers Gas Company LTD., The should be moved from Terminated to Live...until this issue is resolved.

Once these changes have been made, can you please provide updated book values for the terminated and non terminated books. 

Thanks
Maria

Greg said that the cash was not initially swept back up to ENA or Enron Corp. but he doesn't know where it went.  He is going to follow up on this point in the morning with someone else in his group.

I just confirmed with Greg Whiting in Accounting that RMT made $ 250 MM contribution to ERMT.  (RMT obtained such funds through a capital contribution from ENA, which in turn received a $250 MM contribution from Enron Corp.)

Sara,
I spoke with Laurel about the attached... 

We have an existing Master Agreement with UBS.  
This request allows Confirmations to confirm FX trades on-line as an alternative to the Confirmation desk calling on the phone.  

We are not establishing a new broker relationship.

The documents required include:
Participant declaration
Basic Conditions for Use of Electronic Devises 
List of Authorized Users.

I would not think that this request would require the notice which I send for a new Broker relationship.  
Regards, Sheila

Subject:	FW: FX confirmation info

Laurel and Sara.  UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.  You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.  The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.  Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.  It sounds very interesting to me.  Let me know what you think.  I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.

Thank you.

Kelly Summers

Carol,

This file represents in and out collateral, cash, LC, sureties and securities. The Onicas are still trying to reconcile the cash position with acctng and is subject to correction.
I've sent you a margin report via interoffice mail....the downloaded file is pretty messy.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks

Debbie and/or Tanya:
Could you please send me an updated list of LC's that we have posted and that have been posted to us.  Also, could you please send me a margin report that sets forth margin posted to and from our trading counterparties?  We will be beginning the process of responding to termination letters and this information will be helpful to us.  Thanks.


Susan and Stephanie:
For the global chart please set up a column for margin as we need to track margin that we have posted and margin that has been posted to us.

As you are aware a "safety net" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.

Any questions, call me.

Sara,

I researched the deal numbers that Total International Limited requested for termination and they appear to be Financial propane transactions with ENA.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.

EGLI is holding a $420,000 LC that expires 12/21/01 covering a deal with Energy Service Providers LLC.  According to our records, this deal has terminated.  Have we been paid?  Are we owed anything?  Would we have any grounds for drawing prior to the expiry date?


ERAC is also holding a $3,922,500 LC that expires on 12/21.  What is the status of this deal?

Sara,

I asked Simon for a schedule for all of the Credit trades which are in the name of ECT Investments Inc and North America.  If they have been terminated and what is the expected value at termination date.

Simon has sent the attached schedule.  I will review with him tomorrow and then we will follow-up with you.  

Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
As per our conversation, I will wait to hear back from you.  

As part of the ongoing process, I will discuss with you any wire requests where we do not have an exact match between the MSDW account name and the account where the funds are being wired to.

In October we sent $8.2MM from the EBS Ventures MSDW account to this Cherokee bank account because the EBS investments in this MSDW account are in the Apache tax structure and therefore have to go through this bank account.  Since the $12K pertains to the same investment as the $8.2MM, I knew that we would have to send it to the same account.  Danny Wilson and Marian Brisco are familiar with the Apache structure and can better answer any questions relating to the Cherokee account.

Please send the $12,272.30 to the Cherokee bank account.  I believe this amount pertains to interest income from the Hewlett Packard short.

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.

Sara,

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact person to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a start, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterparties (as measured by positive net MTM)

Hi Angela,

It was great seeing you in class this afternoon.  Keep
up the good work! Here is some information about my
Pilates studio as well as Pilates in general. Private
sessions in the studio are much different than the
mass mat class. At Powerhouse Pilates, I will design a
workout specifically for your body. We will focus on
your problem areas and we will increase your overall
strength and flexibility using all of the Pilates
equipment.

1. The benefits of Pilates

Pilates strengthens your abdominals, tightens your
buttocks, improves your posture, corrects your
alignment, reduces stress, alleviates lower back pain
and neck pain, strengthens and tones your muscles
without building bulk, and lengthens your body as a
whole. It helps you look and feel great, gives you a
sense of ease and confidence, and helps you feel
grounded and centered at all times.

2. Location

Powerhouse Pilates
1117 Omar St.
Houston, Texas 77009
Phone: 713-880-5307
Fax: 713-426-5466

Powerhouse is located in the Houston Heights, just 10
minutes from downtown Houston. From downtown, take
Allen Parkway to Studemont and turn right on
Studemont. Turn left on Omar and it's in the first
block on the left.

3. Hours of Operation:

Monday-Friday: 7am to 9pm
Saturday: 8am to 2pm

4. Cost:

Private session: $65 per session
Duet: $50 per person

Series cards are also available and can bring the cost
of a private session down to as low as $50 per
session. Duets are Pilates sessions with two students
and one instructor. If you know someone who is
interested in Pilates, you might consider bringing
them in so that you can work out together. If you buy
a duet series card, the price can be as low as $37.50
per person per session.

Series Cards:

Ten private sessions: $550 (save $100)
Fifteen private sessions: $800 (Save $175)
Twenty private sessions: $1000 (save $300)

Ten duet sessions: $425 (save $75)
Fifteen duet sessions: $600 (save $150)
Twenty duet sessions: $750 (save $250)

5. Payment methods:

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, checks,
and cash.

6. Scheduling

Appointments are scheduled on the hour and are fifty
minutes long. You will work on all of the Pilates
equipment and your instructor will develop a Pilates
routine specifically for your body.

7. Credentials

Powerhouse is owned and operated by Anne Walzel, a
certified Pilates instructor, dancer, member of the
Pilates Guild, and Pilates student of ten years. She
was certified through the Pilates Studio of New York
under the direction of Romana Kryzanowska, Joseph
Pilates' protege. Anne has taught Pilates at the
Pilates Studio at Atlanta ballet, the Pilates Studio
of New York, re:AB, and Tribeca Bodyworks, New York's
renowned Pilates studio. She danced at the Houston
Ballet Academy for 15 years as well as the School of
American Ballet, Martha Graham, the Paul Taylor
School, and the Jose Limon Institute, New York. She
has a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University
and is a graduate of St. John's School, Houston.


8. Pilates materials

I hope this information helps! Feel free to call me at
the studio (713-880-5307)to schedule your session or
to ask me any questions.


Sincerely,

Anne Walzel

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

"THE ENRON DEBACLE: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM", a new course by Texas Bar CLE, will be presented March 1, 2002, at the Radisson Astrodome Hotel in Houston.

Course directors Richard Orsinger and Craig Ball are presently recruiting a top-flight faculty for this timely and important program, which promises to examine discovery issues; employees as plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, and whistleblowers; class actions; shareholder remedies; insurance; the collision of criminal and civil matters; juror focus groups; managing the media; and jury selection in a high profile case. Obviously, many important facts about Enron are yet to be determined, so the program topics will be presented in the hypothetical voice.

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the
applicable Determination Period."

Dear John

In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you yesterday, I
propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it includes no
options at all.

short 1660 May 2002 futures

Please understand that this entire affair is making me as uncomfortable as
it is clearly making you.

Kind regards
Kevin R Davis

Sara,

As we discussed, we  would like to notify our customers of our current status and our ability to look after them.  Here is a brief summary of the services contracts and obligations that we currently have along with the notification letter we would like to send them.  Please let us know if we are ok to send these out.

Thanks,

Tom.


MDEA
purchase power for the cities
purchase and schedule gas as agent to supply the cities generating units
real-time operational coordination via our control room to balance the cities load and resources

MDEA relies entirely on EPMI for this as they have no other enabling agreements or marketing/scheduling capability.  We are no longer able to purchase power for them but are able to schedule gas as their agent.  The sities could incur signifigant imbalance charges as a result of our inability to perform.

 

QSE Customers

Green Mountain Power (BP Energy), New Power Company, XERS (starts Jan 1) 

We schedule all power contracts with ERCOT
We settle all charges and payments with ERCOT (ERCOT settles with EPMI and EPMI settles with customer)

 

Frontera

We market the output of the Frontera plant (450 MW) 
We buy to suppy Frontera's obligations (call options to EPMI and Mirant) when the market is below Frontera's cost.
We schedule all transactions as QSE

Frontera has no other enabling agreements and relies on EPMI for all trading activities.

Carol & Sara- 
The original Bank of America letter of credit number 3024519 should be returned to: 
                          Fortis Capital Corp. 
                          ATTN: Jonathan Fronda 
                          Three Stamford Plaza 
                          301 Tresser Blvd. 
                          Stamford, CT  06901-3239 
I am informed that a letter of cancellation signed by an authorized representative of Enron North America Corp. should also accompany the original letter of credit and all amendments.  A facsimile of this cancellation letter is acceptable if transmitted to 203-705-5898 (ATTN: Jonathan Fronda).  A copy of the overnight courier air waybill should be attached to the facsimile. 
I understand that Don Perkins has also started the process to confirm Fortis Capital Corp. letter of credit number 011290 through the parent company, Fortis Bank, as well as making the correction we discussed earlier (delivery of gas).   
Please call me if you have any questions. 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sounds good.  That is the type of language we were trying to express.  Do you mind if I send a copy to Peter Anderson?  Do you think it would be helpful if we all sat down together to discuss any further changes to the document?  

Thanks for all your help.

Subject:	RE: SWAP Unwinding

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

"The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

Peter,
Dan,


Please see our opinion about the procedure of Swap Cancellation
as below:


1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation


Regards
H.Nikaido

                          Stamford, CT  06901-3239 
I am informed that a letter of cancellation signed by an authorized representative of Enron North America Corp. should also accompany the original letter of credit and all amendments.  A facsimile of this cancellation letter is acceptable if transmitted to 203-705-5898 (ATTN: Jonathan Fronda).  A copy of the overnight courier air waybill should be attached to the facsimile. 
I understand that Don Perkins has also started the process to confirm Fortis Capital Corp. letter of credit number 011290 through the parent company, Fortis Bank, as well as making the correction we discussed earlier (delivery of gas).

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

This request to open a brokerage account is in connection with ENA's sale of Hanover Compressor Company Common Stock .  The transaction involves several components.  We are being asked to open a brokerage account with Bear Stearns International Limited so that Bear is able to obtain favorable tax treatment on the specific types of transactions that we are doing.  We are attempting to enter into these transactions on a "one-off" basis to avoid negotiating a brokerage agreement that would govern any future transactions.

Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

Sara,

We have a Master Agreement with NAB Limited.  However, we are doing our FX trades with NAB London.  Presumably, this is simply a branch of NAB Limited which is headquartered in Australia.  Is this a mulitbranch agreement?  Does it cover trades with the London branch?  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!

Subject:	Termination of Swaps - Cresendo, Juniper, Cgas, East Sour Lake ( Hanson)

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.  The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.

Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Thanks,

Tom

Attached is a spreadsheet which contains details of the AirCanada deals we would like to unwind and receive payment.

We are unwinding a Dec01-Mar02 WTI calendar month average swap that we sold to AirCanada.
Rob Fuller's bid to unwind this deal is $18.97 and it is discounted at Libor-flat.

Please call if you have any questions.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the "Confidentiality" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") or Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC").   I was asked to determine if the "Confidentiality" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) "the existence of a Master Agreement" or (b) "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially,

Susan,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Mark Quaglia, an associate in the capital markets group from New York, will be flying here either tonight or first thing in the morning to review confirmations.  He is planning to stay overnight on Thursday.
 
Will there be a checklist for him to use in gathering information from the documents, or should we meet to develop something?

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.


 

Thanks,
Todd

Select Energy has requested that a letter be sent to them that outlines specific bank account instructions for specific Enron entities such as:	

	Enron Power Marketing

	Enron North America - Financial Gas

	Enron North America - Physical Gas

They would also like them to be signed by someone in authority over these groups.  The person I have been speaking with at Select is:

	Dott Tucker - Her phone number is 860-665-2836 in case you should have any questions.  

Thanks for your help in this matter.

CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Based upon yesterday's meeting, we discussed where R& C is in the money and we are the only Enron counter party involved, Pushkar and Stuart could contact these entiies to reach closure to get $ in the door after the appropriate approvals regarding the settlements.

The attached confidential listing shows exposure at 12/12/01.  Any liquidated amounts not settled will need to be taken into account.  

Based on yesterday's discussion, I have sorted the counterparties regarding course of actiion.

If you do NOT agree, please advise ASAP.
Sheila

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

Mr. Suchdev,

Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which supplements the ISDA Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has furnished us with the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to provide a version which includes the credit features.

Hope this helps in the interim.

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft
Credit Support Annex (similar in form to the one previously executed with
ENA).  I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can
leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

Thanks and regards,

I think so.  It makes sense for Rick to sign on these accounts.  I will be talking to Tom Doukas in the next day to get him focused on his accounts that need to be updated for Enron Credit Inc.  Thanks .Donna

Sara,

As I find these, should I ask you or Susan Bailey?  I spoke with Alabama Gas Corp and their council today.  They said that any agreements were terminated as of 12/04/01.  Do you concur?  If you do, I will take them off of our list.

     Clint / Jim,
     
     Have amended the number (and added a reference to the Treasury 
     office):
     
     "Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable
     efforts to promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice 
     by telephone (telephone number 1-800-973-6766, attention Enron 
     Treasury Office) to the Affected Party, provided however, that failure 
     to so confirm will not in anyway invalidate the effectiveness of a 
     notice by facsimile transmission."
     

Please confirm this is now acceptable.

Any questions - don't hesitate to contact me, 203 719 5493

Regards,
Annette Spencer

Christine -
Sara is out of the office for the rest of the week, but I understand why 
you guys have trouble with me specifically being listed.  Instead of my 
number being put in there, can we just use the general Enron Corp phone 
number (1-800-973-6766) and have UBS ask to be connected to the 
Treasurer's office.  There will always be a person there to take the 
call, and you will always be directed to the right person regardless of 
what employee reassignments may occur between now and then.
     
Jim, what do you think of this?  Christine, since Sara is out, would you 
please include Jim Armogida on the distribution list.  Thanks.

Sara,
     
Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations 
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of 
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented. 
 Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any 
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the 
termination notice would not be effective.
     
We propose to insert the following language instead:
     
     
        "Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts 
to 
     promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by 
     telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party, 
     provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway 
     invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile 
transmission."
     
     (insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under 
"Additional 
     Termination Event".)
     
Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new 
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round 
of signatures.
     
Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any 
inconvenience this may cause.
     
Regards,
Christine

Stephanie and Sara -

We currently have several deals on the books with National Energy Group, Inc. that we confirmed under omnibus confirms.  The initial two deals that we did with them, TAGG numbers QY8453 and QY9133, required independent amounts and had the credit language attached.  I have attached those annexes below.  We have since executed the following trades:

VH0606
VH0931
VH0969
VH0982
VT5854
VT5861



Our positions with this counterparty have gone deep in the money to them, and they have asked us to send them back the collateral.  While I am not thrilled about doing this, I understand that this is a commercial issue and we probably need to do this to be responsive to the customer.  If you hadn't guessed by now, this is a Lagrasta customer, so I am getting the requisite incentive from Fred to get this done.

In concert with the return of their collateral, I want to send them a document that allows us to call for margin again if their positions start moving back in ENA's favor.  I want to be able to call them if their position moves any less than $3 million in their favor.  Right now, the positions are over $6 MM in National Energy Group's favor; I want to call them if that exposure changes to anything less than $3 MM in their favor.  This would still give us some "cushion".  

What do we need to do to make this happen?

We just finished doing the xpit that they asked for.  They have agreed to send the money immediately after that was done.  We should be getting the money very soon.  Hold off on the letter right now.

	Legal drafted a letter demanding that EDF return the $25 million they withheld this morning.  I want to send it to EDF to preserve our rights under the customer agreement and to discourage them from this behaviour in the future.  

	Did you ever hear back whether EDF was going to send this to you if you moved the short 1660 May 2002 futures positions?  If you have already resolved the matter and gotten EDF to agree to return the money, I might hold off on sending this.  Sarah

Subject:	TXU

In case we don't hook up, the update on TXU is as follows:

As you know, TXU would like to settle and pay what they owe us.  

I met with Jeff Shorter, my counterparty at TXU last week and presented him with our list of contracts and termination dates.  They sent us preliminary numbers, which appear to be pretty close to what we're showing.  Ball is currently in their court - they are to come back to us with their values as of the termination dates we specified, and back-up for amounts that are essentially their estimates of LDs.  We have questions on their numbers for EPMI and EES, but these only represent around $2mm.  The bulk of the value is in the financial gas position.  The ISDA has not been formally terminated, and we need to agree on a date to do this.  Next step is for them to come with their version of settlement amounts for each contract - we will then provide them with ours, then go to reconciliation process.  

 	 

The first file is Harlan's list of contracts and termination dates.  The second is TXU's estimates of settlement amounts.  We discussed both in our meeting and TXU is to come back with back up for their numbers so we can agree on dates and reconcile.  I have call into Jeff Shorter to follow up - they should be getting back to us shortly.  Assuming they agree with our termination dates, and come back with their back up info, the next step will be for us to meet and reconcile numbers.  This should take place in the next week or so.  If you have any questions please call me.  If I'm not at my desk my cell is 713 826-1439.  Home number is 713 781-2966.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

Best Regards,

Kelly McKenney

1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

Sara,

As in our past exercises for the "Non-Terminated/In-the-Money" Counterparties, the Thiele-Kaolin Company continues to appear as a "financial" trading relationship.

However, according to the Confirmation Desk there are only physical arrangements with this counterparty (as evidenced by our GTC docs).  I hope that Credit can resolve the mystery???

I don't think so.  Do you need it?  I found out that it is not generated by Clara's group.  Plus, the margin position is aggregated with all other futures held in the account; therefore it may not be specific to IRFX.  We did verify the positions before we sold them, but I do not have an accurate number for margin positon.  Please let me know if we need to get in touch with the people who have this information.  Thanks!

Please confirm this amount, and close out the positions.  If there is a discrepency, please give me a call tomorrow and we can discuss further.  Hope you had a good vacation.

All, 

I have confirmed that the following invoices for Williams Production RMT Company ("Williams"), were sent under ENA's Demand Letter dated March 1, 2002:

			Invoice Nos. 	020168809
					0202142

Please note, the only Invoice not included with ENA's Demand Letter to Williams was:   0203094.  Therefore, advise as to whether this invoice also relates to Williams and why it was not included with ENA's letter of March 1st.

Further, please advise if the $7,686.87 interest check relates to all the invoices, including Invoice #0203094.

Simon and Bryan,

Bear Stearns agreed to release the Enron Credit Inc. funds.  They adjusted the number to $66,027.35 to cover some fees.

I have send the funds to an account supplied by Mary Perkins/Sam Round which is a non-DIP ENA account.

Stephanie -

Where do we stand with respect to getting a document into National Energy Group, Inc.?  I need to push this forward, as this is a critical document.  Please let me know how we are proceeding on this.  

As a reminder, I want to have the ability to call for margin if NEGI's positions are any less than $4 million dollars in their favor.  I had put $3 million dollars in my prior email, but this figure should actually be $4 MM. 

I will be out Monday and Tuesday, but please contact Max Sonnonstine with any questions.


Thanks,

JRW

Stephanie and Sara -

We currently have several deals on the books with National Energy Group, Inc. that we confirmed under omnibus confirms.  The initial two deals that we did with them, TAGG numbers QY8453 and QY9133, required independent amounts and had the credit language attached.  I have attached those annexes below.  We have since executed the following trades:

VH0606
VH0931
VH0969
VH0982
VT5854
VT5861



Our positions with this counterparty have gone deep in the money to them, and they have asked us to send them back the collateral.  While I am not thrilled about doing this, I understand that this is a commercial issue and we probably need to do this to be responsive to the customer.  If you hadn't guessed by now, this is a Lagrasta customer, so I am getting the requisite incentive from Fred to get this done.

In concert with the return of their collateral, I want to send them a document that allows us to call for margin again if their positions start moving back in ENA's favor.  I want to be able to call them if their position moves any less than $3 million in their favor.  Right now, the positions are over $6 MM in National Energy Group's favor; I want to call them if that exposure changes to anything less than $3 MM in their favor.  This would still give us some "cushion".  

What do we need to do to make this happen?


JRW

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Gayla,
While I was getting ready to prepare execution copies I was notified of some additional language that is being added to our template that helps clarify a few issues.  I was asked to send you a blacklined draft for review.  Please also forward a copy of the blacklined draft to Tracy and if either of you have any questions regarding the changes please let me know.  The last change in the Annex is still being finalized but I included it so you could review the language/concept.

Brent

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the
applicable Determination Period."

Notice No. 01-372
November 2, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was
73,364 natural gas futures contracts.

I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.  I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.  They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).  He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.  He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).

Susan: Notes for the DDL.

Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.

Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.  (Don't think Navajo will terminate.)  Call if you have questions.

USD/JPY. However, the currency will continue to be mired by pessimism about=
 Japan's deflationary spiral, as well as the rise in Japanese unemployment =

 116.48. Strength in the euro against the yen contrasted with profit taking=
 in USD/JPY and helped the euro against the dollar as it recovered from its=

h rests along the support line of the downward channel extending from 8950 =
to 8735.  USD was slightly weaker today despite Friday's better-than-expect=
ed US consumer confidence, home sales and jobless claims figures. The dolla=
r came under pressure from profit-taking and position squaring ahead of the=
 holiday. Nevertheless, the dollar remains well bid after a recent series o=

In connection with the Legal costs allocations for 2002, what percentage of your time do you think you would spend on EGM matters?

The accounting group who is asking for this information realizes that this is a guess on your part.

I have gotten a call from Roger Mock, CEO of American Public Energy Agency, regarding a series of transactions.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

Below is Williams redlined version of our EOL Amendment.  They were questioning why we backdated the amendment.  This one was back dated because it did not have the language in it which addressed prior EOL Confirmations that were unsigned.  Can we add the following language that was used in other EOL Amendment versions for other companies which addressed that issue?

d. this Amendment shall apply to any EOL Transaction that has not been documented in a confirmation executed and delivered by both parties.

They mainly deleted the Financial language on the Annex.  Brent...can you call them today to discuss.  This would be a great amendment to get in place.  Their attorney's name and phone number is   Tracy Poole (918) 573-4818.

Let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks!

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

   Regards,
   Michelle

All,

ENA has a new registered agent as of its February 2001 filing of a "Certificate of Change" with the Delaware Secretary of State.

As a result, I have updated those SWAP FORMS which include a "process agent" provision.  For your convenience, attached are REDLINED versions of the following documents:

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's
organizational ID number in the signature block where we currently obtain
its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.
This would probably save a bit of time and money.

Thanks.

I agree that the deals that the list of open transactions that Kern provided is all inclusive.  I have left a message for Alan Kornicks, Kern, to call me back to discuss the settlement process they have proposed.  Additionally, I will speak with Ed McMichael regarding our ability to settle and what steps need to occur prior to accepting Kern's termination letter.

Hi, Sara. I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend.

During our discussion on 11/14, you asked that we provide you with a prime
brokerage fee schedule. I'm working with one of the trading assistants to
find one for you, but we're having some difficulty.

If I'm unable to supply you with a fee schedule, is there a specific way you
would like to word Paragraph 9 "Fees and Charges" (other than the phrase "as
agreed by the parties from time to time")? If you would like to keep your
previously proposed wording, I can run it by Legal one more time with an
explanation of the difficulty we're having.

Thanks so much for your patience,

In a letter dtd 3/13/02 Ormet said they wired to ENA $14,645.03 (plus interest) to cure a contract default.  I've been watching the cash inflow spreadsheet that gets published daily but haven't seen these funds on that report.  

Can you let me know whether you see any such payment from Ormet?

Thanks Melissa for your interest in helping us get this improved!

Sara - I would like the opportunity to discuss this subject with Leslie Reeves before we take action. I want to be sure we cover all our bases and not add to our issues. I know this has been an ongoing topic - and I want to be sure I have educated myself on all the options.

Thanks
Evelyn

Sara,

It has been brought to my attention that the payment language we are using for financial power trades that are less than one month in duration does not mention that payment is due 5 business days after the floating price is determinable.  It basically says 5 business days after the last day of the month.

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period of one month or longer).

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Period (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period less than one month).


Can you draft payment language for trades less than one month that states payment is due five business days after the floating price is determinable?

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Melissa

I doubt it as I do not believe any margin calls have been made since our filing; Monica should confirm this.  Unfortunately, we do not have clarity on the valuations, thus we do not know if we are truly entitled to continue to hold the LCs. We can always call for a renewal assuming the same exposures and wait for them to dispute it.

Sara,
We spoke to Ellen Shubert, 203-719-1141.  There were not additional monies paid to the wrong account.  They are looking from payments from ENA to UBS, which include 492,490.29 Aus and  $337,333 SEK . There may be a swiss amount as well.

Mark: 

I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.

Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.

Thanks.

Sara,

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

Kelly Keneally
11 Madison Ave, 5th Floor
NY, NY 10010
Phone: 212/538-5581
Fax: 212/538-4057

Please advise me when you send the documents out so I can ensure they are dealt with properly.

Thanks,

Tom

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Lisa: 

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

I just received two letters from IR dated 12/6/01 and 2/1/02 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on Elliot Bonner's desk.  IR is terminating Commodity Swap Y810701 and demanding payment from ENA.

Kevin, can you please confirm that Y810701 is the only active financial swap between the two parties?  If it is not, then we cannot reflect that IR has terminated its swap(s).  We will also need

The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.

Hi Sara,

There were two options terminated on the same date. I faxed you one of the two. The content was my concern.

Thanks for your feedback.

Jorge:

Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.

It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Barry:

We have calls into both Anne and Treasa to discuss the pending rollover and need for a $200 million increase of the existing CSFB prepay.  As soon as I hear from them, I will let you know.

CSFB and our internal counsel independently agree that the mechanism is in place to quickly and efficiently handle the increase, but as yet CSFB does not have credit approval.  While Osmar and James committed to give me an update on the credit approval process over the weekend, they were clear that the final answer likely will not come until Monday.

As a fallback, can Joe's deal with Chase be increased under the terms and conditions we discussed Friday evening?  Is DB (Paul Cambridge) an alternative?  Aside from CSFB, Chase, Citi and DB, I don't know if any of the other tier one institutions have the ability or capability to respond in the time available.  Possibly Barclays but I understand that their commodity derivative group is just getting started.

If you have any thoughts let me know.  I will give you an update when I speak to London or CSFB.

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

Just a few notes from the Agreement:

(1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin
(2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA)
(3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time"
(4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please?
(5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
(6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation
(7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Taken from this week's edition:
 
A financial black hole 
Houston, we have a problem
Nov 1st 2001 | HOUSTON, LONDON AND NEW YORK 
>From The Economist print  edition

The troubles of Enron, a Texan  powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial  crisis

JUST last year, visitors  to Enron's glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner  that proclaimed the firm, "The world's leading energy company". That annoyed  Enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's  throw away in Houston's Energy Alley, but not as much as what came next-a new  banner, declaring Enron "The world's leading company". In recent weeks, as the  company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been  removed. 
The heady mix of  audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as  any to Enron's remarkable rise and fall. Forged in the 1980s by the merger of  two troubled gas-pipeline firms, Enron drove the development of the  sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to  dominate. Indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with  many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels  with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the hedge fund  that failed in 1998-and not just because seemingly brilliant financial  alchemists have been humbled. Were Enron to go bust-unlikely, but in the current  nervous climate, not impossible-might a crisis ensue?

Troubles in California's  politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth  trading and concerns about management badly dented Enron's share price earlier  this year, prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling, the firm's newish chief  executive, in August. Kenneth Lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of George Bush  and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control.  
This has not slowed  Enron's decline. Day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial  quagmire that is largely of its own creation. Not least thanks to its lack of  transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point  that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread.
Enron's reputation for  financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its  third-quarter results came out in mid-October, showing a $1 billion write-off on  water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. Worse, disclosed  only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered  a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related  private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to  Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound  this summer. Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal  with LJM, a "structured finance vehicle". 
Enron's failure to offer  details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear  the worst about its huge balance sheet. Its shares plunged by 19% on October  30th alone (see chart), before recovering a bit the next day.

Andrew Fastow, who was  replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th, was a general partner in  LJM . Jeffrey McMahon, his successor, has much to do to  restore confidence. Questions abound. Were the trusts run at arm's length? What  did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership? Ominously, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) has now launched a formal  inquiry.
Moody's, a rating  agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above "junk"  level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet  partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not  seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other  obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles.
A lower credit rating  could destroy Enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring  away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. That might have nasty  consequences in other markets. Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant  in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21  billion. Rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates  Enron's presence. If the firms on the other side of Enron's trades start to fear  that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a  knock-on effect. Where this could end up is a subject of much  conjecture.
Utilities that trade  energy could be hit. So could the commodity and derivative operations of large  commercial and investment banks. The ties are notably tight between Enron and  J.P. Morgan Chase, according to Ventana Capital, a research firm. Not only does  J.P. Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron; it also  has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business  trading commodities. There is "no doubt" that Enron is on the other side of many  J.P. Morgan trades, says Ventana.
Were Enron to fail,  Ventana thinks "it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis", worse,  in some ways, than what occurred after LTCM . That merely  froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks  of the American economy. Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal,  metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals  in.
As yet, this all seems  unlikely. Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week, although at  shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. Trading on  EnronOnline was reportedly strong. Jim Donnell of Duke Energy, a big energy trader,  described "a huge dichotomy" between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the  equity and credit markets and the "business as usual" attitude taken by big  commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty.
Yet as questions about  Enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making  markets in some instruments. Few firms would accept Enron's name as guarantor of  a credit derivative. In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties  refused the Enron name. On the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take  Enron's credit. 
The biggest credit  exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to Enron  were drawn down last week. J.P. Morgan arranged an additional $1 billion  emergency credit-line this week. This back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed  mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade.

Too big to fail?
Is Enron too big and too  important to be allowed to fail? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, thinks  that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced.  Enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly.
But even Enron's worst  enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. Most  traders seem keen that it should live. "Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader  disappear," says one. They admire Enron's armies of traders and their ability to  do deals. EnronOnline is one of the Internet's few success stories, assuming its  huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm  claims.
Enron's, and the  financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to  meet its obligations. On the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. But its  lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. In June 2000, The  Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance,  high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. His response was  revealing. To show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm  unfairly maligned by critics: Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that  rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s.  Drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being "very  innovative and very aggressive". Drexel was not bailed out: Michael Milken, its  star, ended up in jail, and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and  ignominy.

I have delivered  my request for withdrawal to the 16th Floor receptionist (which I believe is Zulie's desk) for delivery to Pam, but the instructions appear to say that Renee is to get the request form....if Renee is the required recipient, please make sure that it is delivered to her.   I would hope that under the circumstances the  Plan Committee would authorize these transfers without delay so that the requested wire transfers can be made today.

Sincerely
Barbara Gray

The multi-page printout titled "Bankruptcy Book Exposure - COB 2/1/02," which contains exposure broken out by power, gas, and all other products shows exposure as gas-physical only.  

The same is true for:
National Fuel Marketing Company LLC
Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp.
San Diego Gas and Electric Company

Can we remove all of these from our "financial" list?

Eric Boyt: Note that the above listed companies might get shifted to the physical book.

Sheila:
After we spoke, I did go back and check the rule and it appears that the filing must be made for 3 more quarters in 2002.  In the example used by the SEC:  [Enron] will file a Form 13F for the calendar quarter ending in December 200[1] - and the calendar quarters ending in March 200[2], June 200[2], and September 200[2] - if [Enron] meet[s] the $100 million filing threshold on the last trading day of at least one month during the year 200[1].  In other words, if we go this route, I think we need 2 more filings for 2002.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the

   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature

   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.

Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

Sara -

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
Michelle

I received a voice mail from Leo Radkowski (phone: 303-978-4965, fax: 303-978-3563, email: radkowsk@jm.com) today.  Johns Manville is in receipt of our termination letter and wishes to pay past due amount and discuss prospect for settlement.  

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log with the above note.

Sara: I'm inclined to reply that we are going to stand by or termination and will be happy to discuss settlement down the road.  What do you think?  

Thanks

Sara and Marie,

Can you fax the ENA agreement to Bob Georgio, head of Customer Accounts, 212-325-1987, Fax 917-326-8030?
I told him we got the ECT Investments back but have not seen the ENA since 7/6/01, when sent to CSFB, and have not gotten a response from CSFB on inqueries.

He wants to take a look at it.  The other contact I got was Marcel McNeal, 212-538-4415, Prime Broker accounts but we will try Bob Georgio first.

Sheila

We don't have to wait until the board meeting.  We do a unanimous written consent and circulate among the directors for signature.

Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick start signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you had to do for me.

I think so.  It makes sense for Rick to sign on these accounts.  I will be talking to Tom Doukas in the next day to get him focused on his accounts that need to be updated for Enron Credit Inc.  Thanks .Donna

I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?

Maricela, attached is a draft of one of the Purchase Agreements in conection with the Raptor unwind. Similar agreements are envisioned for each of the other Raptor structures. The plan is to dissolve each Raptor entity [except for the entities involved in Raptor 3, namely Pronghorn I LLC and Porcupine, LLC] the day following the LJM buyout -- in other words, prior to the end of the quarter. [In the case of Raptor 3, since the note is monetized into Hawaii, this will need to remain in place until the take out of the note.] Please prepare the necessary documents for filing with the Secretary of State to dissolve the following entities:

Grizzly I LLC,
Timberwolf, LLC
Roadrunner I LLC
Bobcat, LLC 
Harrier I LLC
Talon, LLC

Sara,
I had a message from Thay Bishop that they sent the agreement back to us in Nov.  She is trying to locate a copy to send to us.  I will follow back up with her and see who they sent the agreement to.

Will you please call Ty (whatever her name is)?  The reason being that their termination notice relates to the ISDA (I believe) which we do not have.  Thanks.

Sass,

I hope they're not reading your email.  This one has probably already
circulated around the office.

Everyone asks about you, scarey thought is that David Shaab asks about you
all the time....

FYI.

Do you think we should begin the process of sending letters asking for back-up from the counterparties who have sent us termination payment notices, but where we believe we are in-the-money?

Subject:	Counterparty Calculations

Attached is a list of the counterparties who have provided termination payment calculations.  I have identified whether or not such counterparty provided backup to its calculation, but obviously cannot determine if such backup is sufficient.  For all new notices, backup will be identified when the notice is recorded on the termination log.  I did not look at the ECC or London entities.  For the US entities, we have begun to make files for those counterparties who submitted a calculation, but the files only contain the termination notices at this time.  As I understand, we will be focusing on the non-terminated in-the-money, then the terminated in-the-money.  Therefore, we have not begun pulling the contracts for these counterparties.


 << File: Counterparty Calculations.xls >> 

We have been concentrating on the non-terminated in-the-money financial contracts.  For each counterparty, we are pulling 1) the financial agreement, 2) all financial confirmations live as of November 30, 2001, 3) any physical agreements for that counterparty, and 4) any physical confirmations live as of November 30.

I spoke w/ Renee Fenlason today.  They want to terminate all open  positions.  I provided Stephanie Panus' fax (713-646-4818).  We'll probably see this termination letter tomorrow.

(She said they have positions in Apr02 and May02 only.  Our data as of Mar.18, 2002 has the two CPs (I and III) MTM as OTM to ENA.  Each CP is valued at -$114,649.)

Rene with Daimon Partners at 512-327-6122 has requested that the financial gas contracts with Enron be terminated for April and May.  She wanted to know who she could speak with regarding this issue.  Per our conversation, I have placed a call to her and given her your name as well as Sara Shackleton.  Thanks for your help.

Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating =
with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to=
 compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the e=
nd of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this aftern=
oon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our =
rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankr=
uptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when=
 in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afte=
rnoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with=
 Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under =
the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of th=
e expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can d=
eclare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination pay=
ment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the=
 cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  Tha=
t's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

Attached are the draft ConfirmLogic documents for Entergy Koch for your review.  Prior to this going to a wider circulation within Enron for comment I would appreciate any comments or suggestions on the structure and format.  There are many definitions in these documents that will need careful review to ensure that the end result is consistent with our practice.  Exhibit A needs to be modified so that the Index name is consistent with what will be input into ConfirmLogic.  There are also some missing variables in certain of the indexes that will need clarification.     

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
Brent

Rex--I did get with Bob, and he sees no problems with the puts.  He does want you to be aware of them, which I said you are.

Sara--I think that is it.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Armo:  I won't be able to get in the loop on these confirms----I am sure that you are already assisting Sara, but if not, could you jump in and help her with any questions or issues she has?  As always, if you need additional support you can call on Baird.  Thanks---I need all the help I can get these days!!

Subject:	FW: Put Confirmations:  ENE as "Seller" and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. as "Buyer" (or "Lehman")

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

Tom:

Further to my voice mail, attached is a "short list" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.
 
Thanks.  Sara

Artie McCoy, VP Financial Surveillance with the NYMEX, 212/299-2928, is awaiting our decision as to whether it is our intention to withdraw from trading on the NYMEX.  Sara, as you may recall, I passed his name on to you about 10 days ago, before UBS surprised us when they walked in and said they were now rethinking wanting the seats again.  So I called Artie back at that time and said the situation was evolving, and once we knew what UBS wanted to do we would let him know.  That's where we left it.

Sara:

I am following up with you regarding a timetable for the top 20 customers.  Per our conversation last Friday we had discussed that you would coordinate with the other lawyers to review the top 20 list and draft amendments for using CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module for the purpose of confirmations.  

The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.

If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

Thanks, 
KC

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

	Carol,

	We're still trying to collect all the documentation on exactly what was liquidated. We've asked the confirm to desk to provide what they have, and asked Tana to try to collect the outstanding. 

	We'll make sure to copy you guys so we're all in the same loop.

	Thanks for your help,

Hi Sara
How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.
Oh and Park's friend is Nick Barnard and he is in the financial dept.

Clint,

Per our discussions, we need to agree to some modifications to the
confirmation this week in order to proceed with the roll.

These modifications involve making sure we can receive the cash due to us if
you net share settle, and should not impact your accounting for the
transactions.   This clauses are standard - I'm not sure how they got
dropped from the confirmation.

Here is a blackline version of the confirm: <<Enron confirm blackline

Sara,

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the "merger
letter".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

Maureen.

I received a phone call from Nancy Bauer with Bear Stearns International Ltd. ("Bear Stearns").  Nancy has  informed me that Bear Stearns will be doing a large trade with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") very soon.  Their goal is to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place quickly.  Bear Stearns would like for the ISDA Master Agreement with ENA to mirror the ISDA Master Agreement dated July 3, 2000 between Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns.   

My review of our Lotus Notes database did not reveal that Enron Credit Limited has a Master Agreement with Bear Stearns.  If this Master Agreement has been executed, please make an entry for it in Lotus Notes.  Also, please e-mail me a copy of the execution version of the Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns Master Agreement for legal and credit in Houston to review.  Since time is of the essence, your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Maricela, attached is a draft of one of the Purchase Agreements in conection with the Raptor unwind. Similar agreements are envisioned for each of the other Raptor structures. The plan is to dissolve each Raptor entity [except for the entities involved in Raptor 3, namely Pronghorn I LLC and Porcupine, LLC] the day following the LJM buyout -- in other words, prior to the end of the quarter. [In the case of Raptor 3, since the note is monetized into Hawaii, this will need to remain in place until the take out of the note.] Please prepare the necessary documents for filing with the Secretary of State to dissolve the following entities:

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements Reminder

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

Sara, we will look into the list of CPs Maria assembled below.  With regard to Wexford Spectrum Investors and Solitair Corp.,  are we certain that they are contracts w/ ENA?  It seems as long as they are ENA CPs it doesn't't matter what internal risk book they are included in.  Do you agree?

Mary,
Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.  The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.  In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.

The amount is $985,614.39.

Please advise.
Sheila

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

If there are any outstanding legal issues outside of credit, please proceed working on the issues.  It appears that we missed out on an RFP because the contract has not been worked out.  This has now become a "high" priority from the desk.  If you would like, we can discuss further in the meeting today.

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.


Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

In the Master Letter Log (version 3/20/02) Belco is included with the early termination made by Westport Resources Corporation.  We currently have Belco as a live (non-terminated) CP but this may be incorrect.  Please review the Master Letter Log AND the termination provided by Westport Resources to determine whether Belco is included in that early termination.

Teresa, I think Brenda has initiated the internal procedure for the purchase of several of these entities [those that are not already 100% Enron owned.] We have received the request from accounting to dissolve the entities on an expedited basis prior to the quarter close. If there are valid reasons for not doing so, we will simply need to communicate with the affected groups.

Needless to say, we need to hold off on filing until after we effect the purchases, and paid LJM for the member interests.

Maricela:  The procedure for dissolving entities is that you notify us - which you have done - we are required to send a notice of intent to dissolve to the business, legal, tax and accounting groups and give them time to respond - in the event someone has a reason that entities can not be dissolved (which appears to be unlikely) we normally give them 10 days to respond - but we can make that shorter if necessary.  If we do not receive any objections to the dissolutions then Corp. Legal prepares the appropriate documentation (which I will ask to have expedited) - Clement Abrams reviews and initials - and I circulate documents for signature.  Upon receipt of signed documents I file the Certificates of Cancellation with the Secretary of State of Delaware.  I will send out the Notice of Intent to Dissolve/Cancel this entities today.  If you or Joel have any questions regarding the above - please call me.  Teresa

Carol/Clement:  Just giving you a heads-up that we may need some rush cancellations of the below LLC's prepared.  Carol I will touch base with you on Monday - to give you the information you may need to prepare documentation.  Teresa

Maricela, attached is a draft of one of the Purchase Agreements in conection with the Raptor unwind. Similar agreements are envisioned for each of the other Raptor structures. The plan is to dissolve each Raptor entity [except for the entities involved in Raptor 3, namely Pronghorn I LLC and Porcupine, LLC] the day following the LJM buyout -- in other words, prior to the end of the quarter. [In the case of Raptor 3, since the note is monetized into Hawaii, this will need to remain in place until the take out of the note.] Please prepare the necessary documents for filing with the Secretary of State to dissolve the following entities:

Grizzly I LLC,
Timberwolf, LLC
Roadrunner I LLC
Bobcat, LLC 
Harrier I LLC
Talon, LLC

Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this morning:

1.	Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has paid Enron.  I have not heard from Mark or Tom.  The LC expires on 12/28.

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to contact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Credit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give them until Wednesday to renew.

6.	Niagra Mohawk/ENA, Metromedia energy/ENA, Simpson Tacoma/ENA, The Energy Authority/ENA, Energy Production/ENA, Rising Star Energy LLC/ENA - I am waiting on payment history info from Leslie to see if we have any right to draw.   Could someone in credit confirm that we are in-the-money on all of these?

7.	City of Santa Clara - Harlan to send out default notice.

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin

So long as they adopt 10a as well--that is what we are doing.  We will need to be careful as and when this is finalized to segregate threshold etc. for the prepay deal.  
Also, talk to Musch re tax rep.

I have another one for you guys.  I do not anticipate any urgency on this, but would still like it out of the way.

Thanks,

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

Sheila,
 
I have just received confirmation from Dave that we should not transfer funds out of ECT Diversified Investments, LLC's Morgan Stanley account to Enron Corp.  At some point in the future, we may decide to transfer the funds directly to ECT Investing Partners' bank account, but these funds should not be "swept" or otherwise transferred to Enron Corp. or other Enron affiliates.
 
ECT Diversified is wholly owned by ECT Investing Partners, L.P. which has unrelated 3rd party investors.  Any transfer to Enron Corp. or its affiliates under the current circumstances would be in contravention of the ECT Investing Partners partnership agreement.
 
Please note also that we to need ensure that no assets are sold out of this or any other brokerage accounts relating to these transactions without Dave's approval - specifically, brokerage accounts owned by the following entities:
 
ECT Investing Partners, L.P.
ECT Diversified Investments, L.L.C.
Maliseet Properties, Inc.
EBS Ventures, L.L.C. (indirectly owned by Cherokee Finance VOF)
 
Thanks for the heads up Sheila, and please let me know if you have further questions.
 
Danny

Sara,

I'll be happy to bring you the agreements that Georgi pulled out of Livelink yesterday.  I'm not trying to push off any responsibility with AA, but I'd feel more comfortable if you controlled the information going out due to the confidentiality concerns we discussed yesterday.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,

Sara,

I've been working with Carrie Richardson (Andersen auditor) regarding master contracts covering interest rate and foreign currency transactions.  The Global Contracts group has been able to find almost all the contracts with a few exceptions.  

The first, between ENA and HSBC Futures Inc., was set up in the Legal tracking database but we never did receive the actual documents.  The record in Global Contracts was finally trade suspended (as a result of a previous audit) until we can locate that documentation.  We do have an agreement between the CP and RMT. [Shackleton, Sara]  This agreement is a Futures Agreement [Shackleton, Sara]  ; I'm confused about RMT's arrangement with HSBC (we only use RMT for ISDA agreements with ENA) 

We also cannot locate a master agreement between ENA and BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp.  Georgi Landau has checked the Legal tracking database and didn't find anything there either.  Carrie has requested two transactions for this CP. [Shackleton, Sara]    This agreement is a repo agreement. 

Can you please try to locate master agreements for these counterparties?  If you are not the person I need to speak to, can you please direct me to someone else?  I'd like to give Carrie an answer as soon as I can.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Jennifer,

I have reviewed your list of counterparties and have determined which we have ISDA Master Agreements.  I will review those agreements this afternoon.

However, we do not have a master agreement in place for the following counterparties:

	Rand-Whitney Container Board, L.P.
	Pacifica Paper (n/k/a Norske Skog Canada Limited)
	Lin Packaging (Lin Pac, Inc.)
	Dial 
	Master Packaging  (Master Packaging (N.B.) Inc.
	Sodra (Sodra Skogsagarna)
	Appleton Paper
	Boise Cascade
	
Further, the following master agreements were negotiated out of London with the Enron affiliate -- Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. ("ECTRIC"):

		Caima (Companhia de Celulose do Caima)


Let me know if you have any questions with the foregoing.

Susan Bailey

Attached are clean and redline versions of the "without margining" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

Hey,

We have decided that it would be best to set up an account at CSFB.  I think you guys are already working on everything else, but we will need to additionally complete the customer account agreement and W-9.  Once everything is complete, can you please send me copies for our records.  

Also, we are still pending an okay from Donna Lowry.

Thanks!

Is all this being worked with Nora Dobin?  I think some of these are in the volumetric production payment vehicles.  we need to be careful.  Nancy, will you call Nora Dobin?

Eric:  are any of these tied to the production payment deals?  Please advise us all.

Subject:	Termination of Swaps - Cresendo, Juniper, Cgas, East Sour Lake ( Hanson)

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

We provided CSFB puts just like Lehman.  We did that the last time we had to move the trigger price since our stock price was declining.  As a result of us giving them puts, they took the trigger price out which means that we don't have to renegotiate the confirms every time our stock heads south.  Jeff, would you please get the details of the puts to Sara.  Thanks.

Yes, please forward to Sara.  Of course, if you can afford it, the almost-universally acclaimed best Oregon Pinot comes from either Beaux Freres (Parker is a part owner) or Archery Summit (Phil Andrus' new, gravity-fed, underground winery with a European architectural flair, which is unusual in Oregon wineries).  Those are about $60-$80 for their best single-vineyard stuff.

This is good info...do you mind if I forward it on to Sara Shackleton, who is an even bigger Pinot fan than me?  Come visit and we'll drink a bottle of Merry Edwards, which is a Russian River Valley winery and which makes my favorite Pinot (although I love the  Ken Wrights a lot)

PS Those prices sound a little better than we do here not to menton the availability problem

My neighbor here is a faithful Ken Wright customer; during the holidays he was invited to a small-scale, cozy affair in Ken's winery, and since my friend's wife didn't want to go, he took me.  We bought several bottles each of the 2001 Pinots; I think our price was $33 per bottle (and $66 for a magnum, but the prices were nonlinear and higher for larger bottles).  Besides the yummy snacks, the highlight for me was to taste each of the single vineyard 2001 Pinots; in most cases, the grower himself (didn't see any women growers there) was there, thiefing out of the casks, which had only just been filled.  I met Mr. McCrone, whose wines were my favorite, and several other growers who sell to Wright.

Albertson's here is selling 2000 K. Wrights at $39.99 per bottle, but there is a 10% discount if you buy six bottles.  I'm telling you this so that you'll know that we can't do much better here than you did.  

Have you tried Chehalem's 2000 three-vineyard Pinot?  You might be able to find it for about $25, and I think it's a great value.

I have been befriended by a commercial grower (he has 17 acres planted between Newburg and Dundee), who has had me out several times to pick and prune.  Soon I'll help him bottle his 2000 Pinot, which is exquisite, and he's going to give me some bottles for my trouble.  He's getting his winery licenses, but has recently been selling all his fruit (which is very low yield, less than 2 lbs per vine) to Eric Hamacher.  Check out Hamacher in Parker's report on the 2000 Oregon Pinots, and you will see that Parker believes young Eric (I met him at my friend's vineyard) might become the best maker of Pinot on Earth (those aren't my words, they're Parker's, or at least his assistant's).  Hamacher wines are hard to find here (low production), but since he's young, they are only about $35.  A real bargain from a rising star.  Same for Patty Green, who used to be the maker for Torii Mor, although I don't know much about her; her wines are supposed to be outstanding and still not too expensive.

In my own yard, I have a mini-vineyard of 25 plants, mostly grafted Dijon clones (115 and 777 on 101-14 rootstock, and own-rooted Pommard).

Hope all is well with you, Dan.  Take care,

Kenton

Sara!

We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.

Richard!

In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.

Will there be a checklist for him to use in gathering information from the documents, or should we meet to develop something?

Sara,

I had mentioned that I thought West LB was missing a few trades, but everything now appears to be o.k.  I double checked the spreadsheet they sent, and the extra trades we have actually cancel one another out.  

What we now need from West LB is their settlement amount and valuation methodology.  

Thanks!

It was Mark wilson who is no longer here.  I am trying to get a new name from the London people. 

Assuming they approve this what is the turnaround you think?

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Sara and Tanya,
Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called this morning and left a voice mail.  He requested that I call him back because he wanted to clarify their stance.  

It is probably more for one of you to speak to him rather than myself.

Please advise if one of you will give him a call this afternoon.
Thanks. Sheila

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Sara, 
Shane and I are okay with:
1 okay
2 okay
3 okay. we have schedule and are okay with it.  It is competitive with other Futures clearing charges.
4 okay, we do not do external position reporting
5  Does Metals, Enron Metals Limited,  qualify as an FCM?  There was some talk about using metals as a futures clearer for GAs so it may be.  They cleared our Softs trading for Agri on LIFFE in the uk.
6 okay for trader change notification
7 I have a call into Frank Cernosek, Financial Operations.  5 days from receipt on monthly statement sounds very restrictive.  
	Sara, Is this consistant with other futures agreements?

Thanks, Sheila

Sheila:

Just a few notes from the Agreement:

(1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin
(2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA)
(3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time"
(4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please?
(5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
(6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation
(7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades

Please advise if you are still the lawyer who reviews RMT masters, when requested for preparation.

If so, Legal has been requested to prepare an ISDA between RMT and Enron Japan Corp., which shall support their FX transactions.

Let me know, so I can pass this draft on to you for review.

Subject: ISDA Master Agreement


Mr. Bromberg,

We have spoken to Thay Bishop regarding the ISDA Master Agreement (the
"Agreement") between MARTA and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA").  Ms.
Bishop stated that she did not have any comments or changes to the
Agreement, and that I should check with you for any changes.  You stated
previously that you did not have any changes - can you please confirm?

We have received the fax of MARTA's outside counsel's legal opinion and
have the following comments:

1.  The first (introductory) paragraph references the date of the ISDA
Master Agreement as June 1, 2001.  The Agreement will be dated May 11,
2001, which is the trade date of the outstanding transaction between
MARTA and ENA.

2.  Since Thay Bishop is unwilling to request another resolution from
MARTA's Board, the legal opinion should specifically reference the
resolution dated April 23, 2001 that has been provided, and that such
resolution is sufficient to grant the authority to enter into the ISDA
Master Agreement and any related documents.

3.   We request that Section 10 of the legal opinion  be revised to add
the following bolded language:  "No person, firm, corporation, entity or
association other than Counterparty may liquidate, borrow, encumber, or
otherwise utilize the assets (including, without limitation, the general
operating fund) of Counterparty."

If you can make these changes to the legal opinion, and if there are no
changes to the ISDA Master Agreement, we can prepare the Agreement for
execution.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or Sara
Shackleton (713/853-5620).

We look forward to hearing from you.

Debbie and/or Tanya:
Could you please send me an updated list of LC's that we have posted and that have been posted to us.  Also, could you please send me a margin report that sets forth margin posted to and from our trading counterparties?  We will be beginning the process of responding to termination letters and this information will be helpful to us.  Thanks.

For the global chart please set up a column for margin as we need to track margin that we have posted and margin that has been posted to us.

Sara:
Here are drafts of the Certificates and Sight Drafts for Niagara Mohawk, El Paso electric, LG&E Energy Marketing and Energy Production Corp. (just in case it wasn't renewed).  I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.  Leslie Reeves will be faxing the invoices to us.  I will be in tomorrow until around 11.  Thanks for your help on this.


        

All of these docs are in a file called Enron Restructuring.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical "(including automatic termination, if applicable)" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Sara and Susan,

I was just wondering whether you've received credit terms to include in the
Credit Support Annex Paragraph 13.  Once we receive these terms, I will
immediately consult my Credit Dept. and respond.

Thanks,

Vijay

		Mr. Suchdev,

		Attached is our sample form of Paragraph 13, which
supplements
	the
	ISDA
		Credit Support Annex boilerplate.   Once Credit has
furnished us
	with
		the terms under a Credit Worksheet, we will be able to
provide a
	version
		which includes the credit features.

		Hope this helps in the interim.

Tom:

Further to my voice mail, attached is a "short list" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.
 
Thanks.  Sara

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin

Sara-

As discussed, I am forwarding the correspondence from Beth Ng of Morgan Stanley containing the draft netting agreements (based on the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. forms provided to Morgan Stanley) to be entered into by EGLI and ERAC.  

I am attaching below, amended versions of the netting agreements that Morgan Stanley would like to enter into today.  I note that Tom Moran, who heads up EGM credit, would like to get Morgan Stanley comfortable ASAP.

Let me know if there is any problem with entering into these arrangements.

Thanks for your help.

John

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Regards
Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Thanks,

Don

Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
summary of what occured.


UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).

On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
1121B1Q8052C001081).

UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.

On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
payment was never received.

If you need additional information please contact me at 203-719-1141 or
Bryan Murtagh 203-719-8955.  Here are our contacts at Enron who are
aware of this issue.

What are your thoughts on terminations of ISDAs that are really late? for example, the new york times declared 1/25/02 as the termination date, citing the bankruptcy which was 12/2/01.  While newprint valuations may not have moved very much due to the low volatility, what about companies who have other products?  They can just be waiting until the marks are in their favor to terminate.  Is there any way to prevent and how are we handling, if at all?

Sara,

On item 1...To my knowledge, the confirms and EOL amendments have a different rounding convention for Power vs. MMBtus.  Gas is 4 places and Power is 3.

Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.  On October 9th, I forwarded an email to you requesting your review of that language that we received from Brent Hendry.  I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.
Please let me know what changes are necessary.

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Hi guys,

This is an article that ran yesterday in the L.A. Times, and I believe on
Sunday in the New York Times by Rod Smith on Chardonnay.  D-G gets a nice
mention so I thought I'd try to pass it along.

Let me know if this comes through since it's the first time I've attempted
to forward an aritcle.

Dan

Chardonnay Breaks the Butterscotch Barrier

Rod Smith

February 27 2002

I used to be a staunch ABC man. "Anything But Chardonnay" (and Cabernet) was
my motto. I was simply bored with the sameness of the oak-flavored grape
syrups so many California vintners were producing from the state's two
predominant varieties.

We should not move non-debtor cash into the cash collateral account.

There are potential tax issues associated with this and the DIP Lenders do not want non-debtor cash in that account.

We do not want to move excess cash at the debtor into the cash collateral account to cover this untill after we have had a chance to discuss this with the banks.

For the time being - do not do anything - we will advise further.

Subject:	Further Transfer to DIP Commitment Account

Since Dec 3, cash has been received by ECT Investments, Inc. from the liquidation of the equity trading book; it was returned to ECT as the related brokerage accounts were closed. ECT Investments, Inc. is not a filed entity. Based on our interpretation of the current DIP Loan Agreement, an equal amount should be transferred to the DIP Commitment Account beacuse the receipt of the cash was a Collateralization Event.

The amount is $27,009,246.

Does anyone think that we should not transfer that amount from Debtor funds into the Commitment Account? Otherwise, I would like Jill Erwin to prepare a wire to go out Tuesday. The payment would need approval from the Daily Cash Committee.

Sheila, can you confirm my math?
Travis, can you confirm that ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly-owned first tier subsidiary of ENA?

More money may need to go into the Commitment Account based on cash receipts to date. More research needs to be done on Enron Credit Inc and ECT Finance Europe.

Thanks. Yes, our group was aware - evidently all the Japan crude trades will be like this, also w/a crude swap w/the Singapore office so Japan is flat.

There are a handful of counterparties that have posted LC's with us that expire in december (some this week).  What can we do if anything?  If these relate to ISDA's might they have an obligation to renew since we are inside the 20 day period?

Carol,

This file represents in and out collateral, cash, LC, sureties and securities. The Onicas are still trying to reconcile the cash position with acctng and is subject to correction.
I've sent you a margin report via interoffice mail....the downloaded file is pretty messy.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks

Debbie and/or Tanya:
Could you please send me an updated list of LC's that we have posted and that have been posted to us.  Also, could you please send me a margin report that sets forth margin posted to and from our trading counterparties?  We will be beginning the process of responding to termination letters and this information will be helpful to us.  Thanks.


Susan and Stephanie:
For the global chart please set up a column for margin as we need to track margin that we have posted and margin that has been posted to us.

You are right-it should be 24.5 hours remaining as you used 24 hours in this last pay period (there is no "religious holiday" category so that went against vacation time.  I had to check with John Blaylock again.

The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

Sorry for rambling.

Mark:  Please read the attached message.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

(2)  I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.  I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.

Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.

Subject:	Metzler Capital Markets - Executing broker agreement

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

I think Bonneville is a terminated physical deal.  Regardless, I need an address for them to use to notify Enron Estate of their request.  Do you want to use the same address for both physical and financial contracts?

Note, this log is slightly different from Clara's file--it does not include the A/R and A/P items.  But, we will be updating that spreadsheet as well today.  I've gone through the Termination letters that I could find, and have updated the sheet accordingly.  

If a collateral amount shows as a negative number, it means Enron has posted the money.  This is why in the "Amount" column you will see a negative valuation owed by Enron, negative collateral, and a smaller net negative amount due.  

Please call if you have any questions.

You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.

What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the

Leslie:
It is my understanding that settlement payments are due tomorrow for EPMI trades done with the following counterparties:

El Paso Electric Company
LG&E Energy Marketing Inc.
Great Bay Power Corporation
Niagra Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc.


EPMI is holding LC's that expire 12/31/01 as collateral.  Please advise me ASAP as soon as you know whether payment has been made as we may have a right to draw prior to the expiry date.

Is anyone aware of any other deafults that would give us a right to draw?

Greg and Georgeanne,

There is a working group reviewing whether and when RMT should file for bankruptcy protection.  Greg's group provided a November 30th trial balance for RMT, but we need a more "user friendly" and more recent (if possible) balance sheet and income statement for RMT.  As I'm not sure which one of you I should ask, given all the developments with the new trading company, I am sending this request to both of you.  Consequently, could you please have someone in your group send us this information?  Also, we need more information on ERMT, a company that was set up in November.  Is there someone in your group to get information on this company?

As always, I really appreciate your help.

Best regards,
Susan

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Dear Sara,

Thanks for this help and I hope you are well.  Will make these changes to our form ASAP and get back to you if need be (I am still on my own here unfortunately so things are pretty hectic).  Comments below.

May be better if you look at our current version of Confirm/Annex A - attached.

Jane:

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date
[McBride, Jane]  Looks good
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
[McBride, Jane]  I will discuss with our CAO - he proposed and likes this language but i see your point
(3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  
I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  
[McBride, Jane]  Agree that we need to work on these defns - we back to back crude deals with Singapore and this seems to be what they use there - I don't mind what we use but must be the same as what Singapore put in back to back with us.

Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  
[McBride, Jane]  Yes, and it is market practice apparently to use commercial bank rates.

Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
[McBride, Jane]  
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 
[McBride, Jane]  Yes and it has been signed and delivered already. 
Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.
[McBride, Jane]  This has been sorted I think now, see attachment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

Regards.  Sara

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Notice No. 02-55
February 14, 2002

To:			All Exchange Members / Member Firms
			All Clearing Members

From:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

Re:		NYMEX, CME Partner to Offer E-mini Energy Futures

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Inc. (CME) today announced at a joint news conference in New York
that they have reached a cooperative agreement to offer newly created
"E-mini" versions of key NYMEX energy futures contracts for trading on CME's
GLOBEX
 electronic trading platform and clearing at the NYMEX Clearing
House.

	The first E-mini energy contracts will begin trading in the summer,
officials of the exchanges said.

	The agreement calls for the two exchanges to launch smaller,
electronically traded versions of NYMEX's crude oil, natural gas, heating
oil and gasoline futures contracts.  Precious metals contracts may be
introduced in subsequent phases.  Modeled after CME's popular line of E-mini
stock index contracts, which are one-fifth the size of the standard-sized
contracts, the new E-mini energy and precious metals futures would be a
to-be-determined fraction of the size of the standard-sized NYMEX contracts.


	Under the cross-access program, CME members will be granted access
to GLOBEX to trade the E-mini versions of the energy futures products and to
NYMEX ACCESS* to trade NYMEX Division products listed on that system,
subject to the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.  CME members who are not
members of NYMEX will receive discounts for these trades.  Similarly, NYMEX
members will receive access to GLOBEX and discounts on fees for CME products
traded on GLOBEX with a CME member firm guarantee, and for the E-mini energy
products with the guarantee of a NYMEX clearing firm.

	The Exchange officials said that a cross-margining program will
provide capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary
accounts by combining the positions at joint or affiliated clearing members
in baskets of CME and NYMEX or COMEX Division commodities, the new E-mini
energy products, and GSCI* futures and options into a single portfolio.  The
risk-based performance bond (margining) systems of each clearing
organization will then determine a single performance bond requirement
across both markets.

	Vincent Viola, NYMEX Chairman, said, "This deal will bring our
successful energy products to a broad retail user base through the GLOBEX
distribution network, as well as expand the opportunities and cost
efficiencies for participants in both markets."

 	"This is an innovative new development in the futures industry that
builds on the long-standing relationship between our exchanges," said CME
Chairman Scott Gordon.  "With this cooperation agreement, we are blending
CME's successful E-mini concept, our GLOBEX infrastructure and global
distribution network with NYMEX's proven product line, established liquidity
and customer relationships in these markets."

	NYMEX President J. Robert Collins, Jr., said, "In 2002, we have seen
a 64% increase in natural gas futures over the same period last year, as
well as a 20% increase in overall energy futures trading.  By reducing the
size of the contract unit, we hope to emulate the CME's success in expanding
the trading community for our most liquid markets."

	"Tremendous synergy has been developed between the open outcry and
electronic trading in our stock index markets since CME first introduced the
E-mini S&P 500 futures contract in 1997 and the E-mini Nasdaq-100 contract
in 1999," said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty.  "By
expanding GLOBEX distribution to the NYMEX floor and leveraging our existing
distribution channels, we hope to build on our previous success, enhance
market liquidity and expand the customer base for energy and, potentially,
metals futures."

	Unlike their standard-sized counterparts, the new E-mini products
will be cash-settled to the respective NYMEX futures contract month final
settlement price on the last day of trading.  Two contract months will trade
at any given time.

	GLOBEX is an open access electronic trading platform that displays
the "book" to any qualified market participant with the ability to route
orders to the system.  The book represents the ability to view bids and
offers in the market.  Under the agreement, market participants interested
in trading the new products will be designated "qualified" if they are
guaranteed by a NYMEX clearing member firm.  In addition, NYMEX members and
customers trading the new products on GLOBEX will have access to CME's
electronically traded products, subject to the guarantee of a CME clearing
firm.

	In addition to the extensive distribution network and connectivity
alternatives of GLOBEX, the exchanges will work together to provide NYMEX
members and customers with access to GLOBEX, both on the NYMEX trading floor
and around the world.  Points of access will include GLOBEX TraderSM-Direct
terminals placed on the NYMEX trading floor adjacent to the pit, enhancing
liquidity and providing trading opportunities similar to CME's E-mini equity
index complex on its trading floor.

	NYMEX and CME jointly developed CLEARING 21*, the clearing platform
operated at both exchanges for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and
settlement of exchange-based transactions. The system processes reported
trades and tracks positions continuously in real time, providing users with
instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure.

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., (www.nymex.com) is a subsidiary of
NYMEX Holdings, Inc.  The Exchange is the world's largest physical
commodities exchange, and the preeminent global trading forum for energy,

spreads between crude oil and heating oil and crude oil and gasoline. In
2001, its trading volume totaled more than 103 million contracts, with a
notional value of approximately $3.2 trillion. Overall Exchange volume
year-to-date is up 26 percent.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (www.cme.com) is the largest futures
exchange in the United States.  As an international marketplace, CME brings
together buyers and sellers on its trading floors and GLOBEX
around-the-clock electronic trading platform.  CME offers futures contracts
and options on futures primarily in four product areas:  interest rates,
stock indexes, foreign exchange and commodities.  CME pioneered the
E-mini concept with the September 1997 launch of E-mini S&P 500 futures and
options.  The exchange followed up in 1999 with E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures.
The two stock index futures contracts quickly became the fastest-growing
products in CME history.  The exchange moves about $1.5 billion per day in
settlement payments and manages $28.2 billion in collateral deposits.  CME
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

Mike,

May I get a status on the $159,022.86 wire request for Enron North America for account 102-06159-26, for our Hedge book?

Also, do you know if BS has liquidated all the positions held in the Enron Credit Inc accounts?    I believe that they were working on a sale of the 91,674 long shares of MLMG.

When can we get a release of the residual balances held in the Bear Stearns accounts for ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron Credit Inc.?

Would you please have someone fax me copies of all of our current statements at 713-646-2196?

Many thanks,
Sheila

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,
Caroline

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.  On October 9th, I forwarded an email to you requesting your review of that language that we received from Brent Hendry.  I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.
Please let me know what changes are necessary.

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

I would like to get together soon to discuss the Clorox ISDA and the comments we sent back to them.

I also received a Confidentiality Agreement from Ivex Packaging Corporation that I need to get back to them. I will have someone bring it by your office to review.

Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

Best Regards,

Kelly McKenney

I don't think the account number is the issue.  I am more concerned that we have not responded to their letter, and they seem to think that they can just send us the money as though we have agreed to the amount.  Do we have a process yet for how we are going to divide up responses, track them, etc.?

We are still doing business with Bear, but we are in the process of winding down the entire book.  Considering our future prospects are somewhere between slim and none I doubt any agreements going forward will matter.

You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha=
ve been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section=
 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's "priority" position (assumin=
g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff=
 rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof=
f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h=
as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
=20
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen=
t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we=
 may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste=
r agreement and transactions "as security".  Please review and advise of an=
y particular language you think should be added. =20

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p=
rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the=
 end of 7(b), ";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje=
ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all =
rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section]."

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master nettin=
g agreement?

I wanted to get something more formal to document deals in the name of Enron North America and ECT Investments.

I will let you know when I understand the amounts for ENA.

Simon,
I resorted your schedule to get the balances with the street.  

Does this make sense?  I am trying to get the third party balance for ENA and ECT Investments Inc.  ECT INvestments is the estimated loss of 890,589.  ENA looks like a positive $15.4 million?

Please consider the distribution list of this email as the Enron working group for the CSFB Prepay.  I have included James Moran at CSFB and ask that James advise us as to the individuals within CSFB that should receive documents.

Mary Cook, in coordination with Sara Shackleton, hopes to distribute this evening a marked copy of the swap confirmations that address the margin issues that were discussed today.

Term, rates, amount, and settlement dates will be blank but will need to address the expanded transaction.  The existing $150 will mature in one year while the incremental $200 will mature the first week of April 2002.  The confirmations will be based on the CSFB International Master ISDA agreement.  We will have to determine the optimal method to address the CSFB Cayman Island entity.

James Moran:

We would like to schedule a time with your internal counsel as early as possible on Tuesday to discuss the modifications.  Please advise us as to availability.

Treasa:

We have a call scheduled for 7:30 am Houston time with Houston (Paul Garcia) and London (Ann Hicks) cash management to discuss the funds flow mechanics.

Could you confirm with your traders the appropriate settlement period and any limitations of the existing deal.  I assume that we have to price the existing $150 and the incremental $200 on September 26 to settle on Friday September 28.   There can be no slippage.

Could you also distribute a draft of the prepay script?

Mary and Sara:

We will need to confirm who will be executing the documents for Enron, confirms as well as corporate guaranty?

Mary Perkins:

I will need to update you as well and discuss some other aspects of the transaction.

Subject: '99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies


Dear Ms. Sara Shackleton,

'99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies

We have our (extremely tiny) allocation of 1999 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.
Prices are high (but a good bit less than some we've seen).  I've indicated
the number of bottles available.  These are due in a couple of months.

Plus some other outstanding 1999 Red Burgundies which have just arrived.
All are net priced.  Some (i.e. Mugneret and Pousse d'Or) are even
reasonable.

1. '99 DRC Vosne "Duvault-Blochet" (12) $149.99 net
2. '99 DRC Echezeaux (6) $179.99 net
3. '99 DRC Grands Echezeaux (6) $249.99 net
4. '99 DRC Romanee-St.-Vivant (6) $299.99 net
5. '99 DRC Richebourg (6) $399.99 net
6. '99 DRC La Tache (6) $499.99 net
7. '99 DRC Romanee-Conti (3) $2299.99 net

The DRC's director, Aubert de Villaine, considers these among the best wines
he has ever made.  In fact, as Burghound explains, he doesn't think it is
possible to have better grapes than he had in 1999.  These are historic
wines, and the demand for them unprecedented.

8. '99 de Vogue Chambolle-Musigny $59.99 net

Just one case left.  As you probably know, much of this is from very fancy
de-classified fruit.

9. '99 Mugneret Vosne-Romanee $39.99 net
10. '99 Mugneret Nuits "Chaignots" $49.99 net

Nobody makes purer, classier or more classic red Burgundies than Mugneret,
and these '99s are just beautiful.  The Nuits "Chaignots" is always a
favorite, and this is probably the most delicious I can remember.  And as
Tanzer says, the Vosne-Romanee is "rich and fine, with lovely fruit and
plaint texture.  This has superb fruit for a village wine."  These are red
Burgundies for purists, and are still quite affordable given the esteem of
this estate.  (At least they're affordable here; Tanzer prices them at $55
and $80.)

11. '99 Pousse d'Or Santenay "Clos Tavannes" $27.99 net
12. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" $39.99 net
13. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "60 Ouvrees" $44.99 net
14. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Bousse d'Or" $49.99 net

1999 is the comeback vintage for this historic estate.  And the prices are
still remarkably reasonable for what's in the bottle.  Burghound (the only
American critic to review them so far, and a quite conservative one) rates
the Santenay "Clos Tavannes" 90 points.  It's absolutely delicious.  The
Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" is 89-92: "positively effusive with its
exquisite nose of sexy, seductive black fruit and perfumed aromatics
followed by sexy, beautifully detailed and rich flavors of juicy, succulent
crushed berries and cassis.  Yet for all the fireworks, it somehow manages
to remain completely Volnay in character.  Lovely stuff."  If this sounds
good, it is.

And believe it or not, the top two Pousse d'Or monopolies, the famous "Clos
des Soixante-Ouvrees" and "Clos de la Bousse d'Or" are even better!  Once
again, these superb wines are among Volnay's elite.

Sara,

I spoke with Jeff and as we are winding down the book he asked that we just draw this out a little bit.  He feels it is not going to be needed as the book is going away.  Also there is no intention of moving any securities from one entity to the other.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

Sara

Assuming they approve this what is the turnaround you think?

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Sheila,

Please find enclosed the instructions to wire funds from ECI's Bear Stearns accounts to Enron Credit Limited account at the Bank of Scotland. I am also faxing you the requests that have been signed by Bryan.  

Please discuss with Sara as I believe she has already communicated with Bear on this matter.   

Thanks for your help and please feel free to call me at 77834777 or alternatively contact Bryan at the same number.

Regards,

David

Kim,
Here are the draft documents with comments from Mark.  I need your input to make sure that the settlements group would understand the terminology the same way I have defined it.  I have followed strict ISDA definitions which is not how we typically draft our documents.  If we need to I can meet with you to discuss how this is to be structured.

Kathryn,
How was it envisioned that ConfirmLogic would handle the difference between the Term of the Underlying Transaction and the exercise period of the swaption?

Leslie,
I modified the ERCOT definitions to make them consistent with the latest draft you sent me.  There are two floating price definitions that appear to have additional variables in them.  (The Megawatt Daily Index Daily and the Megawatt Daily Index Forward.)  How were these additional variables to be handled in ConfirmLogic?  Additionally the headings of each of these Floating Price descriptions do not seem to be consistent with the pub code designation that will be used in ConfirmLogic.  Are the descriptions going to be updated to be consistent?

Please let me know if anyone has any questions or comments on the draft documents.

    

Regards,

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, March 21, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)	=	$4,000
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN (1 * $3,500)	=	- $3,500
Net Scan Risk ($4,000-$3,500)		=	$   500
Spread Rate	(1* $500)			+	$   500
Total Requirement				=	$1,000
Scan Risk Example Summary
Margin on a Spread Between a Tier 1 and Tier 2 Futures Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):	$1,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin):		$1,100
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):	$1,350


 Inter-Month Spread  Margins on Natural Gas and Henry Hub Swap Futures
Contracts
				Clearing	Member	Member Customer
Non-Member
Tier 1 (1st Nearby Month):		 $500			$550
$675
Tier 2 (2nd Nearby Month):		 $250			$275
$237
Tier 3 (3rd  - 6th Nearby Months):	 $250			$275
$237
Tier 4 (7th   - 12th Nearby Months): 	 $250			$275
$237
Tier 5 (13th and greater):		 $100			$110
$135

The inter-commodity spread margins will be $0 between Natural Gas (NG) and
Henry Hub Swap (NN) futures contracts. Spread credits between Henry Hub Swap
futures and all other NYMEX energy products will be the same as the Natural
Gas spread credits.
Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright and spread margins for
the NYMEX Natural Gas (NG) futures contract and the NYMEX Henry Hub Swap
futures contract.

Hi Sara
How are you? hope you are doing well. I just got off the phone with my dad so i was thinking about you and wanted to say hi. I am comign home next weekend (March 22) and will be happyy to see you that saturday. I am only in town for like 40 hours so it is a short visit but i am looking forward to it. 
So I am sure my dad told you but i am taking another job. Starting Monday, I am the new Merchandising asst for Old Navy women's division and i am really excited about this. So Friday is my last day at Entertainment Weekly so this is a huge change.
I also have some other news but this is just btw you and me for now. I am working on ways to tell my dad so I wanted to see what you would suggest and advise. Park has asked me to move in with him and so I have decided that I want to do that. He and I are not ready to get engaged at all and not ready to get married but we are so in love and pratically live together now so this just makes sense. But i do not want to make my dad upset and am not sure how he would feel about this..... and so I was hoping you could give my any advice or suggest a way to tell this to him.... I hope that this does not put you in an awkward position and if so, then pelase tel me and I will not ask you anyhtign about it again. 
 
Thanks Sara. I hope you have a nice Monday and I am excited to see you in two weeks. Talk to you soon
Scottie

Other than rate or currency, what else do we use these Enron Corp masters for (I seem to recall used for Enron stock stuff)? Who would I contact and be able to get details on the transactions from? Someone in Corp? Thanks!!

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

Hello Robert,
Hello Sara,

The purpose of this e-mail is to supplement my voice mail messages this morning.  I know a lot is going on and that the legal team must be all hands on deck.  Having said this, however, I would appreciate it if you could give me a sense of where you efforts stood prior to recent events.  Further, I would like to get a general sense of timing relative to the continuance of your efforts.  To this end I would greatly appreciate a 15 minute catch up session.  This catch up will help me manage other outside relationships.  I will ask Anita Llamas-Granado to try to schedule either a call or a face-to-face.  Thanks.

FC

where is this coming from? are counterparties asking to be paid throughout the month? or is this coming from our side?

Subject:	Payment Date for financial power transactions

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

The PLI has a 2-day seminar in Houston on Nov. 5 and 6 which I would like to attend (mega-refresher course for me).  The cost is $1295.  Although I have been looking for a seminar about equity derivatives, this seminar will be helpful in the context of ENE forwards and other affiliated equity deals from the securities vantage point.

Let me know if you would like to see the brochure.

Gary Hickerson has authorized the addition of Deutsche Bank for Futures Trading.  

We have been using Carr Futures in the European Market but Carr Futures no longer has the presence and coverage needed; whereas, Deutsche Bank can fulfill our trading needs at competitive clearing rates.

I will forward the account opening documentation to Legal when received.

Subject:	Further Transfer to DIP Commitment Account

Since Dec 3, cash has been received by ECT Investments, Inc. from the liquidation of the equity trading book; it was returned to ECT as the related brokerage accounts were closed. ECT Investments, Inc. is not a filed entity. Based on our interpretation of the current DIP Loan Agreement, an equal amount should be transferred to the DIP Commitment Account beacuse the receipt of the cash was a Collateralization Event.

The amount is $27,009,246.

Does anyone think that we should not transfer that amount from Debtor funds into the Commitment Account? Otherwise, I would like Jill Erwin to prepare a wire to go out Tuesday. The payment would need approval from the Daily Cash Committee.

Sheila, can you confirm my math?
Travis, can you confirm that ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly-owned first tier subsidiary of ENA?

More money may need to go into the Commitment Account based on cash receipts to date. More research needs to be done on Enron Credit Inc and ECT Finance Europe.

Jim

Louis,
Last fall Westport and Belco merged, with Westport being the surviving entity.  We had Master Agreements in place with both entities and had not yet reached agreement with Westport as to which Master would remain in place.  Therefore, we received one letter from Westport terminating both Masters.

In the Master Letter Log (version 3/20/02) Belco is included with the early termination made by Westport Resources Corporation.  We currently have Belco as a live (non-terminated) CP but this may be incorrect.  Please review the Master Letter Log AND the termination provided by Westport Resources to determine whether Belco is included in that early termination.

Sara,

Unfortunately, I do not know either of these people.  I was given their
names from the lawyer who replaced me at A&K in negotiating ISDA's on
Bridgeline's behalf (Sharon Ward).      Entergy-Koch   -   Troy Martin
713-544-6210   and Marty Jo Rogers 713-544-5282.  I hope this is helpful.

Jason

fax from genre....

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forward with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade late Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbacks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working on our side.  Thanks.

Simon,
It may make sense for you to make a copy of the confirmation of all outstanding trades for ENA and ECT Investments Inc and send to us here.  Then, if no one is left in London, we will be able to get the documentation from here.

Maricela, attached is a draft of one of the Purchase Agreements in conection with the Raptor unwind. Similar agreements are envisioned for each of the other Raptor structures. The plan is to dissolve each Raptor entity [except for the entities involved in Raptor 3, namely Pronghorn I LLC and Porcupine, LLC] the day following the LJM buyout -- in other words, prior to the end of the quarter. [In the case of Raptor 3, since the note is monetized into Hawaii, this will need to remain in place until the take out of the note.] Please prepare the necessary documents for filing with the Secretary of State to dissolve the following entities:

Grizzly I LLC,
Timberwolf, LLC
Roadrunner I LLC
Bobcat, LLC 
Harrier I LLC
Talon, LLC

Chris Calger is looking for the underlying documentation for the swap between Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp. and Chase entered into on April 9, 1999.  A similar swap was entered into between the American Public Energy Agency and Chase on the same date.

A transaction diagram for the transaction is attached for your reference.

Please call either Chris or me with any questions.

Thanks.

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Mary,
Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.  The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.  In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.

The amount is $985,614.39.

Please advise.
Sheila

hi sara -- i tried to leave you a message but the voicemail is little screwed up.  so i will just send you an email.

on the whitewing share settlement agreement/put: when does the put get terminated per the ISDA?  when we have satisfied all the obligations under the put by delivering shares and/or cash, how can we make sure the put will go away?

thanks.

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to "kill" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1).

Simon,

We may have problems with this because the Credit book is still under the ENA family of accounts.  ENA is bankrupt so they most likely will be unwilling to wire the funds somewhere else.

Do you have any documentation which suppots that the Credit book was being moved to Enron Credit as a stand-alone account at Goldman Sachs?  Does GS have anything?

Regards,

Sheila

I thought that you, Mark Quaglia, and the other fellow from Cadwalader are assigned to the top nonterminated financial gas contracts, with more resources to come.

Am I right?

P.S. The list sent to Louis is not the live gas financial contracts, and has not been updated for awhile.

Fimat accepted the Enron Corp guarantee so our trading line with then will be increased tomorrow (to approximately $15-16 million from $11 million.)  Fimat will have our trading line up to $20 million as soon as they complete their internal credit process. 

The Soc Gen money is priced as follows:

Original margin:  LIBOR
Variation margin: LIBOR + 5 bp 

Warren will call John directly when the line is increased.  

Thanks to everyone for all their help.
Sarah

Sara,

As per your request, attached is the list of all non-terminated financial liquids trades provided to us by Commercial.  I have compared this list against the report that Samantha Boyd provided to me earlier re "In and Out of the Money Positions as of 11/30/01".  Out of the 51 trades, only 2 are not listed in the report, 5 fall in the "out of the money" category, and the other 44 fall in the "in the money" category.  We have set up files for all 51 trades, and review of the top 10 has been completed by Weezie.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached report.

Regards,

Nony

Sorry for the late reply...you may already have your answer...

PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc.  This is the entity they use for Physical.  I do not see that they trade any Finanical Power.  They have done Nat. Gas financial Swaps with ECC.

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

Russ -
I spoke with Dave Bizer a few minutes ago, and he said that you guys were still going to send the shares to us today even though nothing will happen with the fee and the note until Friday.  I understand from Tim that he and Skip agreed that you guys would keep the shares, and we'd deal with everything on Friday.  So, why don't you guys just hold on to the shares, and we will settle the entire trade all at once on Friday.  I think that would be the easiest and cleanest way to deal with this.  Talk to you soon.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help. 

Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

To the extent any revisions being proposed are modifications to the Electronic Trading Agreement for EOL, I need to know what is being proposed.  We do not generally make many, if any, amendments to that agreement.

Sorry for the heat your taking and I'm trying to track down how we view this. They may be screaming, but there are a number of other issues where we are trying to preserve or realize value that are taking people's attention. We should be able to advise by sometime tomorrow.

Rich,

May I get a status on the requests from last week for the $944,239.43 for the Hedge Book and the $1,493,287.81 for Enron Credit?

The Order I sent for ENA basically allows us to continue to use bank accounts which existed prior to Bankruptcy.

For Enron Credit, I sent supporting documentation which supports that the account was managed and funded by Enron Credit and we had been working for 10 months to get it moved from the ENA family to Enron Credit.

Regards,
Sheila

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

I'm not so sure of that because we couldn't see all of the wire transfers.  There was a credit to the new entity's account in the amount of $250 million on November 5th and then there was a debit of $249,900,000 on the 6th.  It looks like that money went into a Goldman Sachs account.

Here is an estimate of the equity forwards that we'd like to repurchase over the next couple of months.  The dates will probably be a little different, but this should give you an idea as to the timing and sequencing.  If you need anything else, feel free to give me a call.

Sara!

We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.

Richard!

In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

No.  Yesterday, Sheila mentioned that Bob Bruce would be handling the EIM financial contracts.  I do have a stack of Financial confirms that Gordon Heeney provided - who should I send them to?

Cheryl:

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Thanks.  Sara

Notice No. 01-437
December 20, 2001

TO:		All ACCESS/C21 Frame Relay Users

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 Frame Relays


Thank you for your patience and understanding concerning the frame relay
equipment issue.  I'm pleased to inform you that the Exchange has made a
final decision on the disposition of this equipment.

Please be advised that AT&T will be contacting you shortly to arrange for
disconnection and removal of the router and modem only for those NYMEX
ACCESS
 and C-21 users connecting to our systems via frame relay.  This is
AT&T's equipment and they will arrange for its pickup.  Users are
responsible for the costs associated with any AT&T equipment that might be
damaged or lost.

All NYMEX ACCESS
 terminal holders must contact their telephone carrier to
arrange for the discontinuance of phone service to their terminal.  Since
the user set up the account with AT&T, they are responsible for contacting
the carrier and making arrangements for this service to be discontinued.
The Exchange will not do this.  This should be completed as quickly as
possible since the Exchange will not pay for any reimbursement costs
incurred after December 31, 2001.

Finally, with reference to the NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 terminal equipment
itself, the Exchange requires that NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 frame relay
holders write or email the NYMEX Customer Service Call Center (NCSCC) with
their intention to return the equipment to the Exchange at their own cost,
or to keep the equipment and continue using it for NYMEX ACCESS
  and / or
C-21 usage.

To contact NYMEX Customer Service, call: #1-800-438-8616 or e-mail:
CUSTCARE@nymex.com.
To send your response via post, please mail to:
New York Mercantile Exchange
Customer Service Department
World Financial Center
One North End Avenue
14th Floor
New York, NY 10282
Attention: Robert Dagistino, Director and/or Mildred Rodriguez, Business
Analyst

Should you decide to keep the equipment and continue to use C-21 and/or
NYMEX ACCESS
, please be advised that effective December 31, 2001 any
license granted to the C-21 and NYMEX ACCESS
 software programs or any
third-party software that may be accessed via the terminal equipment shall
terminate.  Any use of these software programs after that date or any
copying or re-distribution of these programs is strictly prohibited.  To
continue using the equipment, you must format the hard drive and install any
operating system that supports Internet Explorer 5.1 or greater.

Should you have any questions please contact the NCSCC at 1-800-438-8616 or
e-mail at CUSTCARE@nymex.com.

Thank you for your continued support.

Brent and Sara:
Here is where we ended up yesterday after discussing the LC situation with Debbie:

1.	Debbie and her group will initially review each LC that has been posted to Enron to determine if it is "transaction specific" or if it covers all trades with the counterparty.  If it is transaction specific and the counterparty has performed, then no further action is required.  If the counterparty has not performed then Debbie will work with us to see if a draw can be made.

2.	If the LC covers all trades, Debbie will send copies of the LC and the transactions docs to me and we will determine what rights, if any, we have to draw.  Each month, we will focus on those LC's that are due to expire that month.    

Call me if you have any questions.  We will distribute the work to the trading lawyers as the need arises.

I apologize for not returning the call. I discussed the issue further with =
Melissa M. and Kimberly H.
I think we currently have two separate issues:
First:
Melissa and Kimberly H. I think would prefer to have one paragraph of settl=
ement language to use on all power financial confirms (rather than the two =
current versions) so they could have a "one size fits all" description that=
 still addressed the two types of deals - 1) deals less than one month and =
2) deals one month and greater. Melissa - can you confirm if this is the id=
ea behind what we discussed?
Second:
The language being used currently actually requires I invoice separately th=
e two classes of deals (as specified above) - because the language we uses =
makes deals less than one month due on the fifth workday of the month and m=
akes Month + deals due on the seventh business day because indices are not =
known until second workday.  Invoicing these types of deals separately woul=
d be more time consuming that any benefit that would result.  I have yet an=
other challenge - I have a counterparty that demands their remittance perio=
d of five days starts over if the index is revised after original publicati=
on. Then I have Williams (who we exchange paper with - confirms are not sig=
ned) - who puts net 10 on all their deals. I really cannot come to a soluti=
on. I have only a handful of power counterparties - they end up doing both =
classes of deals - and the settlement date becomes a negoiation every month=
. This is the going to be the third month my department has been responsibl=
e for this area - so the whole situation is rather new. So at this time I t=
hink the probability of solving my problem is remote. So while I appreciate=
 your offer of assistance - I am not entirely sure what to do. Given the ot=
her priorities I have right now - addressing these is going to be in the fu=
ture for me.
=20
I have not had an external request to change the language. I think the main=
 request was from confirms and my issue(s) are secondary -  and for which I=
 have no good solution.
=20
I apologize for the long email - I am trying to do this from home to get ca=
ught up.
Thanks

Subject:	Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update

Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC on 11/2/01;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01;

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above (except item "f") are on my desk in a file marked "Hess" and any documents I've drafted are on a disk marked "Hess" or in my email files (Holly can get into these).

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

Sara,

I went in your office when you weren't there (tee hee!) and gave myself rights to your calendar only.  If you think I will need access to your e-mail or other folders, let me know.  I will need to repeat the process for each folder you would like to give me rights to.

I worked with Sara Shackleton on the swap for this deal.  She or someone else in Mark Taylor's group is probably best positioned to make modifications.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Dale --

I have been working with Jeff Dellapina at Chase on potential revisions to the April '99 prepay -- he has requested an amendment to the original margin agreement.  Currently, we are required to post margin under the swaps once a month.  Chase has requested a change to daily margining.  This change is being driven by our current credit issues, especially with the banks.  I have spoken with Evan Ward at APEA who is working with their lawyers on this.

I was wondering if I should work through you on this or someone in Houston (as you had worked on the original transaction).  Let me know your thoughts when you get the chance and I appreciate your help.

Hi Beth, 

Chris Glaas had forwarded the confirmation formats (including your required changes) that you had sent out to him yesterday evening. At the same time, our lawyers in Houston have circulated a copy of the confirmation yesterday. Principally, they are the same that we circulated earlier, except that some of the defined terms in their confirm is more aligned to the Master Energy Swap Agreement. For e.g. Determination Period, Trading Day, etc.. I am attaching a copy of their draft for your perusal. 

Could you kindly have a look at this latest draft and discuss any possible changes to this, including the legal changes you required in yesterday's draft, with our lawyers Mary Cook (713 345 7732) or Sara Shackleton (713 853 5620) directly. 

We are hoping to get the actual dates, barrels etc. soon. 

Thanks very much for your help.

Where do we stand on this?  Can we proceed with providing GSP a valuation of ENA's claim?

This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.

(1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
(2)  Is this a single swap or several?
(3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Brent -

I have attached a first draft of the documents for Cargill.  The ISDA is a 1992 form signed in April, 1999 with ENA.  The ISDA was amended in Feb., 2001 - changes were only in relation to the definitions of Valuation Percentage, Threshold and some of the LC terms.  

I have based the attached on your Entergy-Koch document and made a few revisions.  I have also raised one question for you to consider.

When you have a chance please take a look at the attached and let's discuss.

Thanks.

Mark

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Peter--

Please find below the language that Sara Shackleton put together to reflect how we intend to unwind this transaction.  When Sarah Wesner returns, can we sit down to make sure that we are on the same page before we talk to Mitsui tonight?  Do you want to set up a meeting in advance of her return?

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

"The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

Subject:	SWAP Unwinding

Peter,
Dan,


Please see our opinion about the procedure of Swap Cancellation
as below:


1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

Someone in settlements needs to contact him to determine Default Rate since BG&E wants to pay full amount (sounds like all deals have terminated)

Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of "material"
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of "rolling" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
"standard" definition of "material.

I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.

Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Thanks for the explanation.  We'll mark Belco Oil and Gas as terminated and inform the risk group so they can move the positions into the correct risk book.

Louis,
Last fall Westport and Belco merged, with Westport being the surviving entity.  We had Master Agreements in place with both entities and had not yet reached agreement with Westport as to which Master would remain in place.  Therefore, we received one letter from Westport terminating both Masters.

In the Master Letter Log (version 3/20/02) Belco is included with the early termination made by Westport Resources Corporation.  We currently have Belco as a live (non-terminated) CP but this may be incorrect.  Please review the Master Letter Log AND the termination provided by Westport Resources to determine whether Belco is included in that early termination.

Sara,

Here is a list of new deals since December 03, 2001.  There are several deals listed as "pending bankruptcy," but were put there by our group due to the bankruptcy itself.  These deals do not have any generated confirmations, but can be done very quickly if you would like.  Please let me know what you would like me to do.


Thanks,

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Working w/ Sara Shackleton we have prepared demand letters for all ITM live financial book counterparites who are also in default on invoice payment.  In total there are about 45.  The objective is to either collect the cash or move the counterparty into terminated status.  Our plan is to begin sending letters today.  Ed McMichael asked me this morning to notify you of this action.

Do you have any issues with our plan?  (I cannot imagine the Creditor's Comm. or E&Y would not want this to occur.)

Call if you have questions.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

A woman called Elaine Schield (x35476) from Accounting has been calling me over the past week or two about the status of the two NYMEX seats and I told her as soon as we heard what was going to happen to them we would let her know.  She also wanted copies of the "seat documents".  Pursuant to my conversations with you and Mark yesterday, I left her a voicemail telling her it was now our understanding that the seats would stay with the Estate and that she needed to contact you in the future.  I left her your phone number.

I told her that the "evidence" of the seats consisted only of the application and the letter received back from the NYMEX approving the application.  There is no other formal evidence of the seats.  I am going to go ahead and copy the seat applications for her (except for the personal applications of Haedicke and Lavorato since it contains personal information such as bank accounts and the like).  I will generally not provide such personal information to anyone unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.

Just a quick update on the LC situation.  We sent a renewal request to Enserco yesterday and they said they would get back to us tomorrow.  If they don't renew by tomorrow I think that we should send them a notice of Event of Default letter which would give them until Wednesday to cure.  If not cured by Wednesday, we could terminate and be in a position to draw on Thursday/Friday.  Who can I coordinate with next week on this?

Leslie Reeves is checking on a few of them that owe payments this week to see if they have paid.

On Vitol, Tom is obtaining a copy of the LC and seeing if they have paid.  He is also checking into Ballarpur.

Greg Johnston e-mailed me to say that they were handling EPCORE and Engage.

We have concluded that nothing can be done on Energy Service Providers, Trafigura and Glencore.

Maria Garza and I checked.  We only see the two trades (TAGG numbers) you reference, none other.  It is our opinion that these trades represent all of the financial GAS positions.  Note that these two trades ended w/ the Feb02 settlement period.

I cannot speak to power or any other commodity.  However, I can provide that Credit Agg didn't show any position exposure for Tri State, which we think is consistent considering there is no existing forward [gas] market price exposure to Tri State.

In summary, my opinion is that there are no other positions.  However, only Beth Apollo's group can provide a conclusive answer.  Hope this helps.

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

John, FYI
Nora, If you could review the other provisions to make sure that they picked up our changes.
Sara, Could you please give a general review?  If you are not the correct party (Jeff Nogid gave me your name), could you give me guidance as to who could assist?


Thanks to everyone.

confusion and please feel free to give me a call to discuss.  If this is
acceptable let me know and I will send a clean copy.  Thanks.

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Recall that you provided invoices for the purpose of attachments to demand letters for live non-pay CPs.  The letters have begun to go out.  I suspect some CPs will notify us of their intention to either 1) pay or 2) not-pay based upon some specific grounds.  For those CPs that don't respond at all as well as those who indicate that they will pay, I need to know who we should contact to determine weather payment was received.  

Please provide a contact person for this task.

Thanks

Bill, Cassandra, and Donna,

Please reply to this mail with your approval of the signing of the below documents which are needed to maintain an account that had previously been in use by ECT/ENA for execution of Bond Trades through prime broker acocunts.

As Enron Credit has now split out into its own entity new documents must be provided to the executing brokers.

Since we were trading in the old name prior with the counterparties this has only recently come up.  It is now disrupting our trading ability as vital couterparties have been restricted from further transactions with us.

Can we have a blanket approval to set up all bond counterparties registered with ECT/ENA to be set up for ECI as well.

Thanks,

Tom Doukas

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

I would not expect EPMI to show up much as all financial transactions are generally done with ENA or ECC.   I probably left Enron MW as it is a wholesale entity that did have a financial transactions. I would not expect that there are other Enron affilliates with financial transactions; however, that file is only what our system had in it on that date.  I cannot represent that it is all inclusive or totally correct, just the best info we had for that date.

EPMI shows up only twice:

United Illuminating Co.

Also, you have an entry for "Enron MW LLC" as party wtih Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.  

Was your list intended to capture any other Enron affiliates other than Enron MW LLC?
Are there any other EPMI parties?

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Mark,

Could you please check to see if we ever got paid by Vitol under contract YC2758.1.  The contract was a sale by Enron Clean Fuels Company to Vitol S.A. Inc for 30,000 bbls +/- 5% of MTBE @ $.7225/gal.  We are currently holding a letter of credit for this transaction which expires on 12/28/01.

In connection with the Legal costs allocations for 2002, what percentage of your time do you think you would spend on EGM matters?

The accounting group who is asking for this information realizes that this is a guess on your part.

Clint,

Here is the calculation again.    As discussed, the forward price was
dropped from the 1/4/02 settlement date level back to the unwind settlement
date of 11/6/01.   For a note issued on 11/6/01, interest should be
calculated to the note maturity date of 12/3/01.

Please let us know when the note is ready to be picked up, and we will send
someone over.

Attached is a spreadsheet which contains details of the AirCanada deals we would like to unwind and receive payment.

We are unwinding a Dec01-Mar02 WTI calendar month average swap that we sold to AirCanada.
Rob Fuller's bid to unwind this deal is $18.97 and it is discounted at Libor-flat.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Sheetal

These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.

Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?

Is all this being worked with Nora Dobin?  I think some of these are in the volumetric production payment vehicles.  we need to be careful.  Nancy, will you call Nora Dobin?

Eric:  are any of these tied to the production payment deals?  Please advise us all.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

Glendale's City Attorney is Steve Lins.  His phone number is 818-548-2080 and his email is slins@ci.glendale.ca.us.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I will be in their offices on Wednesday.

Thanks,  Kim

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Tanya:

EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.

Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?

Kim,
Here are the draft documents with comments from Mark.  I need your input to make sure that the settlements group would understand the terminology the same way I have defined it.  I have followed strict ISDA definitions which is not how we typically draft our documents.  If we need to I can meet with you to discuss how this is to be structured.

Kathryn,
How was it envisioned that ConfirmLogic would handle the difference between the Term of the Underlying Transaction and the exercise period of the swaption?

Leslie,
I modified the ERCOT definitions to make them consistent with the latest draft you sent me.  There are two floating price definitions that appear to have additional variables in them.  (The Megawatt Daily Index Daily and the Megawatt Daily Index Forward.)  How were these additional variables to be handled in ConfirmLogic?  Additionally the headings of each of these Floating Price descriptions do not seem to be consistent with the pub code designation that will be used in ConfirmLogic.  Are the descriptions going to be updated to be consistent?

Please let me know if anyone has any questions or comments on the draft documents.

Jackie,

Legal is reviewing the Terms of Business document for Credit Lyonnais
and Monument Derivatives.

For Equities and Options, we will trade as ECT Investments, Inc.  with
all clearing through Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley &
Co.

For Futures, we will trade as Enron North America Corp. with Give-up to
Carr Futures and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc. We are currently in the
process of setting up the Deutsche Bank agreement.  Rob Manders,
212-469-2034, Rob.Manders@db.com,  may be contacted for more
information.

Legal thought that for the futures we only require your give-up
agreements to Carr and DB and will not need the Terms of Business
Agreement on the Futures side.

Please advise.
Sheila
