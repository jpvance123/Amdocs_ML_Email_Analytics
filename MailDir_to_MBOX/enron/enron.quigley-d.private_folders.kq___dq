thanks for calling the lawn guy
I ordered flowers from River Oaks Plant House - the ones with lemons in bottom to send to Amy and Baby Mackenzie.
I'm sure she'll love them.

Mark your calendar-- 
	the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is moving to a new administrator!

In preparation, here are a few things you need to remember.

For All Savings Plan participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be the last day to:
?	Request a loan or a loan payoff so that funds can be allocated or distributed in time.
?	Request a withdrawal (In-service or Hardship).

For SDA Participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be your last day to:
?	Make trades in your Schwab SDA brokerage account so that we can move your holdings in-kind. 
?	Re-invest any Schwab mutual funds into your choice of funds  - the default will be your money market fund.

Other transactions, such as Contribution Rate Changes and Investment Fund Transfers, will continue until 3:00pm CST on October 26.  

EnronBenefits... keeping pace with your lifestyle.

Thursday evening
 
Hi Sissy,
 
When do you guys leave for Vegas and who will  babysit Rex? Wish I was there to watch him for you and start cooking for  Thanksgiving. 
Dad flew in this morning and we are busy in the  office here at home. He finally has purchase orders coming in from Mobil - yeh!!  We sent in over 1/2 million in quotations and got purchase orders for over  100.000.00 this morning. Looks like things are finally going to pay off for all  of Dad's hard work. They also leased a big vessel to Texaco yesterday! Horray  for him!
Have a great trip an write when you get back and  tell me all about the money you won!!??!!
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and  Dad

Enron's debt ratings cut
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two steps above junk-bond status, and warned it may cut the rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. The ratings agency cut Houston, Texas-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2"from "Baa1", and said it may cut Enron's "Prime-2" commercial paper rating. Its rating actions affect $13 billion. According to Moody's, Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments. 

Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back outstanding commercial paper.

I have not yet found an effective way to come to peace with the anger and resentment I still feel with our situation. This along with being easily influenced by others has not allowed me to go through a proper healing process for the deepness of the hurt I feel. 
It is not fair nor acceptable for me to not take 100% ressponsibility for the breakdown in communication with you last nite and the continuous fuel I add to the conflict.
I am resolving to get better counsel and find better ways of coping with my feelings so that I can end the cycle of anger between us and be more accepting, appreciative and non resentful for who you are and stop trying to change you or push opinions on you. I have to find peace somehow and will no longer do things that continue to make you feel threatened, alone, unsafe and unloved. Whatever the outcome, I can't live with myself until I manage to do these things.
Kay

I feel after last night that we are unable to rationally communicate with each other at this point in our lives.
I still want to get to a point where we can, I love you and I want to try and make this work.  If it is already to late 
the we need to work through that also.

I am working on myself to get to a better place as are you, I feel as though you have formulated your own reasons
 of why I act the way I do. I have been struggling with myself to find them and it is harder for me when you 
do not listen to me. From the note you left me last night I was looking forward to talking to you and I was not ready
last night and It did not go well. I am also in  a very lonely place right now in my life and just want to be happy and carefree
again.  It will take time and that is whwere I am at right now.

I did not call you back last night b/c I did not want to fight anymore then we had already.

I love you Kay

Hey Family!

This year I am going to do something I have never done before...start
shopping early.  In order to do that, I need to know what everyone would
like for Christmas.  Please do not reply back and tell me you don't need
anything, because I know there is something out there that you would like.
Please e-mail or give me a call soon so I can get started!

                                Love, Heather

P.S. Also let me know what your spouses would like too.

Good morning to my sweet honey..
Hope your day goes well...I really hope
that I did not come across as insensitive in our 
discussion to try to get the townhouse back in the
event we get a contract on our lot, I just want what is best
given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
have "down time" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our
lot comes through.
love you 
k-kay

Just so you don't double up and call Continental - i went ahead and called
to get our new itenerary- we still leave on a nonstop Friday 11/16 departing 9:50pm and get there at 10:55p
On the return- they had us leaving at 6:40 on 11/20 going thru Phoenix and arriving home at 1am
I changed it to leaving Vegas at 4pm nonstop flight to home and arrive here 9pm (this cut 1 hour 20 min off travel time)
hope that is okay

GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You blow your romantic competition 
out of the water. If you slow your pace at work for the sake of being

 the good life tonight. Accept the invitation, and live it up!

Kay,

Thanks a ton for the card, smell-good pencils, and book for Jackie - she's
at Michelle's tonight but I'll see her over the weekend.  She's in much
better spirits these days but her blood counts are still very low - keeping
her un-infected and out of the hospital is our main goal at this point -
she's still not allowed to go out in public or see non-family memebers.  A
key date occurs in about 1 month - they'll check her bone marrow again and
actually it's an extremely critical date - if no cancer then we can have a
small celebration - but she's still got a good 2 years to go before we can
breath easier.

Robert

Today is my grandmother's birthday......she would have been 92. Today is a
day to celebrate a woman's life who brought MUCH joy and love to me and many
others. She was there for me as a child .... to hold me, protect me, love
me. Over the years we tokk many long walks around the block in Leisure
World, watched jeopardy, wheel of fortune  and the evening news while
sipping on perfect Manhattans and having dinner, discussed golf and her
clubs and my new game, chatted about football, politics, and life til wee
hours....and then arose to read the headlines and drink coffee to chat all
over again. I will miss spending holidays with her, hanging out with her,
and being with her. She is the most positive woman I have ever known. She
always had a smile and good things to say. She brought such joy!! I will
miss her, her smile, and her answer of "I know" whenever I would tell her I
loved her. What a great long life she had.

Please keep my family in your prayers and let those around you "know" your
love in honor of my grandma, Margaret Gress.

Wednesday morning
 
Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Sounds like you had a great time in New Orleans.  I'm glad that you are both spending lots of time together. The package was late  because of all the security at the airports and sounds like you got a taste of  that!
Why is Enron still on a downhill slide? I thought  that when Ken took over again you would see an improvement immediately. What is  the forcast for this last quarter? I know all of you are sick about the stock  prices.
You can call me on Friday - just e-mail me the time  and I will be sure to be at the office. The number is 053-256-098. Remember we  are 7 hours ahead now.
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and  Dad

Tuesday evening
 
Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Congratulations on your new puppy "Rex"!!!
It is always fun to come home to someone who is 
sooooooooooo happy to see you. I have really enjoyed 
having Molly since Dad is traveling so much. In fact he left today to fly  to Port Harcourt and won't return until Friday afternoon. 
I am so glad to know that you sound so happy and things are finally getting  back to normal all around. What will happen to your stock now or do you know  yet?
Any news of Laura - please tell her I am thinking alot about her!
Have a super, super time in Vegas and put a quarter in a slot for me!
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and Dad

Subject:	RE: KS Management - Texas DRAFT ONLY


Kay,

Thank you for the revised contract.  I would like to say that it was a
pleasure meeting you, and I have enjoyed our discussions on the telphone.

I would like to take this opportunity to be upfront with you.  Kelsey's
corporate philosophy is to adopt a customer-driven focus.  So when Kelsey is
a customer, our strong preference is to deal with companies that demonstrate
a customer-driven focus in negotiations -- our experience has been that
companies that demonstrate this focus in negotiations also demonstrate this
focus in service.

However, we have strong reservations that Enron does not take concerns of
potential customers seriously.  This concern manifested itself at our
meeting and, given the paucity of approved changes in the contract, has been
heightened.

Thus, we have made the decision that Kelsey should obtain its energy from a
non-Enron source.  I would like to emphasize that the decision is no
reflection on you; in fact, prior to our meeting, you had very nearly
convinced us that Kelsey should use Enron.

Good luck with your other customers.  Having met you, I know that you will
be successful in all of you endeavors.  If you wish to discuss this further,
please do not hesitate to call.

Nicholas Ro
Vice President &
Chief Compliance Officer

In the Buzz this week:

EES Keeps the Fire Burning

EES Q4 Deals: EES is pounding the pavement, making calls and (of course) making deals. The Third Party Sales Group continues to dominate the small business market in Texas, New York and Massachusetts, currently signing over 2000 new deals each week. Texas, which is known for doing everything in a big way, accounts for about 60 percent of the new deals signed. With success in the three markets already achieved, the Third Party Sales Group has moved into new territory, the Illinois market. The Third Party Sales Group, which was established less than five months ago, has already signed up more than 24,000 customers.

The Mid Market group is also bringing new customers into the fold. In these first few weeks of Q4, the Mid Market group has added Boston Market and Holiday Inn in New York, Moody Gardens and American National Insurance Company in Galveston, the Jewish Community Center Houston, Gulf Coast Retailers Association, El Fenix Restaurants in Dallas and Maxim. 
 
The commercial, manufacturing/industrial and regional commodity groups are continuing to offer EES' products and services to large business consumers and have successfully brought in several large deals over the past few weeks. New customers include Sonoco, Wendy's, Unilever and Sara Lee with gas contracts and Ball Corp, Oil Tanking and Sysco with power contracts in Texas. 

Customer Information and Support: Prior to and following Enron's merger with Dynegy, customers have expressed many questions about EES and where we stand on our contracts. A letter along with a Q&A about EES' position was distributed to customers on November 14 outlining our continued commitment to our contracts and our ongoing efforts to provide excellent customer support. Click here  to read the letter and Q&A sheet.

Inquiries and Customer Satisfaction Support: For the past four months, the EES Business Center has successfully been serving as EES's primary contact and has been instrumental in delivering superb customer care. Please continue to route any general inquiry call that you receive to the center at 800-337-7827.

The Dynegy/Enron Merger
Dynegy and Enron Merger: On November 9, Dynegy and Enron announced an agreement for a merger between the two companies which is expected to confirm the value of Enron's core business, rebuild customer, counter party and investor confidence and strengthen Enron's liquidity. Of the potential options considered outside of a merger, few could provide "the earnings potential and immediate synergies" that a combination with Dynegy could provide according to Greg Whalley, Enron president and chief operating officer. 

The new organization will focus on core businesses including wholesale energy markets and commercial and industrial energy users. Enron will continue to act as an independent company until the merger, which is expected to close at the end of Q3 2002, is complete. Click here  to view the press release outlining the merger details and the merger Q&A.

Enron Investor Update Conference Call: Enron held an investor conference call early Thursday morning to provide investors with an up to date overview of the company's current situation. During the call, Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, reviewed occurrences which led to the current loss in investor confidence and decline in liquidity such as bad investments, "perceived" conflicts of interest in related-party transactions, lack of transparency and errors in financial statements. "We fully understand and regret the combination of events that have resulted in loss of investor confidence," said Lay, and we "are fully committed to fixing the problems." 

In an effort to restore operational and financial momentum, Enron will be split into Core and Non-Core businesses and Businesses Under Review. 
?	The core businesses which were performing at all time highs prior to the events that lead to the merger with    	Dynegy provide "significant earnings and cash flow opportunities with unique competitive advantages," 		according to Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer. Core businesses include the natural gas 		pipeline business, and the gas and power, retail and coal busniesses in North America and Europe.
?	Non-core businesses such as broadband and Azurix will be divested and the earnings will be used to repay 		debt and reinvest in core businesses. 
?	Businesses Under Review are potential future markets outside of power and gas wholesale businesses. 
 
The conference call is separated into five sections: Introduction, Business Overview, Business Segment Update, Financial Review and Outlook and Q&A session for easy access to needed information. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Dynegy and Enron Investor Conference Call: In Monday morning's conference call, Dynegy and Enron executives reviewed the merger details and fielded questions from investors. Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated the strength of Enron's core business units and the high level of integrity of the people working in the trenches. Watson and Ken Lay also spoke of the advantages that Enron's business units would bring to the new organization with Watson making specific note of EES. "EES is three to five years ahead of Dynegy's retail unit" and is an "earnings contributor and growth engine that will continue in the combined company" according to Watson. The conference call replay will be available until 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 26. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Conference Call Slide Show: If you don't have time to listen to the conference, the slideshow presentation is also available. Click here  to view the presentation.

Enron Elects New Treasurer: Raymond M. Bowen, Jr., the former chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets, has been elected as the new executive vice president - finance and treasurer.

thanks for calling the lawn guy
I ordered flowers from River Oaks Plant House - the ones with lemons in bottom to send to Amy and Baby Mackenzie.
I'm sure she'll love them.
