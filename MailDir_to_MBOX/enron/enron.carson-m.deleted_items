Mike,
Thanks for your help just now. I'm unable to reach John Suarez or Paul
Broderick through the main switchboard as of now.  Do you mind passing my
information along to them for the search we spoke about?
Thanks so much,
Rosanna

Dear Body Shop Members,
"Healthy Habits for the Holidays" October 22nd - December 14th

Week Four - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   Family members who traditionally oversee a household's holiday plans are particularly at risk for holiday depression since they frequently feel responsible for a family's good time!  Here's a few coping suggestions to help keep everything in perspective:
Relax!
Keep it simple.
Be realistic.
Ask for help.
Holiday food, gifts and decorations don't have to be elaborate.
Enjoy each other's company.
Remember the reason for the season!
If you're not the host, offer to help, bring food, baby-sit or clean up!
Weight Management:  Pumpkin is a remarkable healthy ingredient!  
High in fiber.
Provides 3.5 times the RDA of vitamin A
Pureed pumpkin (like applesauce and prune puree) can replace fats in baked goods without giving them a rubbery texture. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Due to next week's shorter work week - members who workout a minimum of (1) time that week will be entered in the weekly drawing.
Congrats to:  Daniel Ayers-Winner of Week Three Massage & Karen Herrmann - Winner of Week Three Enron Travel Bag

All,

Here is the schedule for TDS databases on Netco: (as confirmed by Diana Allen)

TDSP	:	Will be a copy from esttdsp as of Thursday, January 17 2002 at 4:00pm (the day before Netco goes live on Friday)
TDST	:	Will be a copy from tds8itst. As requested, whenever the Netco production migration is completed, this will be refreshed from tape as of prior Dec 19 2001. 
TDSD	:	Will be a copy from tds8idev. I have moved this database into a netco server.  As soon as Clement pushed the tnsnames.ora change, you will be able to connect to TDSD


Please let me know if you have question or modification.

Tantra.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA -=
 DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss anoth=
er two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many conten=
ding Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up s=
ome fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Powers =
Rangers Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Dr=
ew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this! =
w! eek," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right =
now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jon=
athan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start =
in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is =
still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to=
 practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for anothe=
r two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key per=
former for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flut=
ie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego =
Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew B=
rees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about c=
ontroversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our =
quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Sti=
ll, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mar=
k Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest=
 of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely aff=
ect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the be=
st run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or =
Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer =
being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinne=
y , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/2! 0/! 01 Kinney (calf) may play this we=
ek after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early t=
his week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (ca=
lf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week =
11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 The Tennesse=
an says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facil=
ity on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any pract=
ice time this w! ee! k.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start a=
gainst Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/20/01 Mi=
nnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have=
 to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game aga=
inst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome =
Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for t=
he season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also h=
urting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the start=
ing lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 Dave =
Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no Q! B ! controversy surrounding =
Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said.=
 ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared=
 away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Dem=
ons Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) w=
ill be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. =
"We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan tol=
d the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's i=
n a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help ou=
r team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay ,=
 RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch=
 Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try=
 to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevi=
n Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a ri=
b injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Phi=
ladelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player=
 at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring=
 any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, =
who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any =
after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Ja=
cquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expe=
cted to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsi=
stent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrel=
l Owens , WR SF - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=
t knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=
 Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=
pected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =
, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=
uring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =
is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=
o real value as a Fantasy player! , ! but he is a key blocker for Duce Stal=
ey.    Giants , DT NYG - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 According to the=
 New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee be=
gan giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsu=
re that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday ni=
ght, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you shou=
ld consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. =
  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Th! e Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 Defensive e=
nd Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee s=
urg! er! y. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore =
defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.  =
  Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley,=
 who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get=
 the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep D=
enver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas=
' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Charger=
s Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denve=
r. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told t=
he Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to=
 Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.   =
  Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruise=
d ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practic=
e time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. T=
he Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn=
 into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after mis=
sing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play=
 on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAG=

 =09 =09    Dear Michael,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling i=
n for Jay Rickerts.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale =
will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina=
.  The focal theme this year is "Energy markets: The challenges of the new =
millennium."  Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energ=
y Congress on Monday.   Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continui=
ng concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill.  Both the House and Sen=
ate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some actio=
n on energy.  There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reduc=
ing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE.  The main action, however, will be b=
ehind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ=
 on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year.=
  We'll bring you more details next week.    A summit on energy efficiency =
is also taking place next week from Washington.  Energy Secretary Spencer A=
braham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representat=
ive  Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. W=
e'll have all the details from the summit next week.   Houston Corresponden=

 have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday.      T=
he Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasolin=
e inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes =
up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool.  Once the blending component is ba=
nned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies.=
  Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on M=
onday.   Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Corr=
espondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandab=
le, but the financial crisis is not.  Kym also talks one-on-one with former=
 California Governor Pete Wilson.  He gives a reflective look into what wen=
t wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do t=
o recover.   With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation C=
EO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compa=
red to this time last year.  He also reacts to word the state may attempt t=

The war against Osama bin Laden is also a contest for the world's largest producer of oil--and a way of life that underlies the American economy.
Hijackings and Anthrax could be just a warm-up to a very different kind of terrorism. The next thing we may have to worry about is a civil war in Saudi Arabia that turns oil into a weapon against the U.S. economy. 
Forget all the rhetoric about ousting infidels and saving starving Iraqis and oppressed Palestinians. Osama bin Laden's primary goal is to overthrow the ruling Al Saud family of Saudi Arabia. This subpopulation of 30,000 (in a country of 22.7 million) includes some 5,000 princes who control virtually all aspects of government and the military. Success would turn the kingdom's 260 billion barrels of crude--25% of the world's proven reserves--over to hostile hands. A fundamentalist government in Saudi Arabia would be "ten times more powerful [than] Iraq or Iran," says Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi-raised oil expert and Ph.D. candidate at MIT who has written extensively about internal struggles in Saudi Arabia. "They could make the Iranian mullahs look like babies." 
Most observers, Obaid included, consider such a revolution unlikely. But bin Laden, Saudi Arabia's own homegrown terrorist, could wreak havoc with oil supplies in other ways--starting with simply surviving the attacks. The longer bombs fall on Afghanistan, the stronger the sympathy for the militants. The Al Saud family is vulnerable to intense internal pressure, especially from the ulema, or senior Muslim clerics. These are the self-appointed guardians of Saudi Arabia's dominant Wahhabi faith, a puritanical strain of Islam from which the royal family derives its legitimacy. The ulema could force the rulers to choose between loyalty to Wahhabism and adherence to a West-leaning policy favoring stable oil prices. 
It has happened before. Threatened by Iraq, the house of Saud tilted westward during the Gulf war and kept exports flowing. But in 1973, Obaid suggests, the ulema pushed King Faisal to impose an oil embargo on the U.S. to punish it for supporting Israel in the October war of that year--helping to shove America into a 15-month recession. 
The U.S. is even more dependent on Saudi oil than it was when we were driving gas-guzzlers in 1972. Even as the average car's fuel efficiency has risen 58% since then, U.S. oil consumption has risen 19% to 19.5 million barrels a day. Domestic oil production over the same period has fallen 39% to 5.8 million barrels. The rest of the crude is imported, with 1.5 million barrels coming from Saudi Arabia, a close second to Canada. 
America imports almost as much oil from Mexico and Venezuela. But the Saudis hold the whip hand in the oil market, thanks to their ability to increase production by as much as 2.5 million barrels a day--or cause a worldwide shortage by turning off the spigots. A terrorist bomb like the one that destroyed Khobar Towers in Dhahran, killing 19 U.S. servicemen in 1996, could achieve the same thing as an embargo by taking out Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura export terminal, which can pump up to 5 million barrels a day into supertankers. "It doesn't matter if we find 1.5 million barrels from somewhere else, if 5 million barrels a day are removed from the world market, prices will spike," says David Pursell, a director at Simmons & Co. in Houston. 
Any price increase has devastating effects on the U.S. economy. Each dollar increase in the per-barrel price of oil trims airline margins by half a percentage point and cuts profits by $450 million, says Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel. Consuming 45 billion gallons of fuel a year, truckers are vulnerable, too: Trucking-company failures tripled from the previous year to 1,320 in last year's third quarter, as fuel prices rose 50%. 
The pain has a widening circle. Since oil is easily substituted for natural gas in many industrial and electrical turbines, prices of the two commodities tend to be correlated (coal less so). Stephen Brown, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, estimates that a 30% increase in the price of oil, sustained for two years, would trim U.S. gross domestic product by nearly 0.8%, or $800 billion a year, and decrease employment by 0.3%. 
And that's just an increase to $28 a barrel. Push the price of oil past $40 and refiners and petrochemicals manufacturers wither as economic activity plunges and costs rise faster than the prices they can charge.

Kansas State's Koehn  Named Big 12 Rookie Of The Week
Wildcats Get Fifth Rookie of the Week  Honor This Season

 
       MANHATTAN, Kan. - Kansas State freshman Laurie Koehn continues to make a  statement for Big 12 Conference Rookie of the Year honors by being named the Big  12 Conference Rookie of the Week today for the third time this  season.
       The  5-foot-8 guard from Hesston, Kan., averaged 17 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0  assists, 3.5 three-pointers and 37 minutes per game in victories over Kansas and  No. 12/13-ranked Texas Tech. The freshman shot 73.3 (11 of 15) percent from the  field, 77.8 (7 of 9) percent from three-point range and 71.4 (5 of 7) percent  from the foul line.
In a win over cross-state rival Kansas,  Koehn had 21 points, five rebounds, two assists and five three-pointers. The  20-plus point performance was the seventh of her career. She shot 60 percent  from the field, 71.4 percent from beyond three-point range and 66.7 percent from  the charity stripe.
 Against Texas Tech, Koehn had 13  points, a rebound, a steal and two three-pointers. She was perfect for the game  as she hit 5-for-5 from the field, 2-for-2 from three-point range and 1-for-1  from the free-throw line. With her two treys, Koehn moved into a tie for sixth  on the Big 12 single-season chart for three-pointers in a season (80). She is  tied with Megan Taylor of Iowa State  (2001).
       Koehn, who  has scored 20 or more points in seven games this season, is Kansas State's  leading scorer (18.1) and fourth in assists (53) and fourth in steals (28). She  is the team's top three-point shooter (44.9 percent) and is shooting 47.7  percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the free-throw line, while  averaging 3.8 three-pointers per game.
 Kansas State has  claimed five of the eight Big 12 Rookie of the Week honors this season with  freshman Kendra Wecker earning the honor twice. K-State has had 12 Big 12  Rookies of the Week honors since the inception of the league. Sophomore Nicole  Ohlde was honored three times last year en route to her Big 12 Freshman of the  Year honor. Koehn, who sat out last year with an injury, was named preseason Big  12 Freshman of the Year in 2000-2001.
    Kansas State, now 19-2 overall and 7-1 in the Big 12, looks to continue its  winning ways when it travels to Austin, Texas, to take on the Texas Longhorns on  Wednesday at 7 p.m.

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Laurie Koehn scored 26 points to lift
>14th-ranked Kansas State to an 85-71 victory over Nebraska in a Big
>12 Conference women's basketball game Saturday played before a
>school-record crowd of 13,466 at Bramlage Coliseum.
>        The victory lifted the Wildcats to 16-1 overall and 4-0 in
>the Big 12, while the Cornhuskers fell to 11-6 and 1-3. K-State has
>won 13 straight games this season.
>        The crowd was announced as a sellout, the first for women's
>basketball in the history of Bramlage Coliseum. The previous high for
>attendance for a K-State women's game was 9,736, set on Feb. 22, 1997
>at a game against Kansas. It was also the largest crowd a Wildcat
>women's team had ever played before either home or away.
>        Kendra Wecker added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the
>Wildcats, while Nicole Ohlde finished 18 points and nine boards.
>        Katie Robinette scored 16 points on 7-for-18 shooting from
>the floor to lead four Nebraska players in double figures. K.C.
>Cowgill scored 15 points for the Huskers, all from three-point range,
>with Stephanie Jones adding 14 points and Keasha Cannon scoring 10.
>        Kansas State iced the victory by hitting 22 of 25 free throws
>in the game, including a 19-for-22 effort in the second half.
>        Kristin Rethman scored five points and Wecker added four in
>an early 9-0 run that put K-State ahead 14-5 with 13:46 left in the
>first half. Nebraska cut the lead to four once before halftime. The
>lead was six with 6:06 remaining in the half when back-to-back
>three-pointers by Koehn and Wecker pushed the Wildcats' edge to 33-21.
>        K-State led 45-32 at the break, as Koehn had 14 points and
>Wecker finished the first half with 13.
>        Nebraska used a 9-0 run early in the second half to cut the
>deficit to 49-45 with 14:19 to play. But the K-State lead was never
>less than four points the rest of the way. The 'Cats led 65-59 with
>7:16 left when Koehn buried a three-pointer and Ohlde hit two free
>throws to increase the lead to 11 with 6:21 remaining.
>        Kansas State led by at least 10 points the rest of the game.
>        Koehn's six three-pointers were the most ever by a Wildcat in
>a conference game. She hit 6 of 9 behind the arc and also went
>6-for-6 from the free-throw line. K-State got four blocked shots by
>Ohlde and five steals by Wecker in a solid floor game.
>        Nebraska held a 46-42 edge in rebounding, as all but one
>Husker who played had at least one rebound. Cannon finished with five
>assists for Nebraska.
>        Kansas State travels to Texas A&M on Jan. 16. The Wildcats'
>next home game is Jan. 23 against Kansas.

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

 Journal Members:     [IMAGE] Riskless Rebound Portfolio [IMAGE]  Our Novem=
ber 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb=
 the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now a=
ppreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brow=
n IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.=
84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, =
and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=
e portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to=
 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=
oking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now a=
nd the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pu=
llback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.   To view=

 opportunity. If the stock drops dramatically again as the result of anothe=
r smear campaign we will get the word out as quickly as possible.   In the =
interim, shareholders should be heartened by September quarterly financial =
results, which are as follows:   Consolidated revenues were $5.5 million, u=

million, up from $.70 million last year (up 43%). Consolidated EBITDA profi=

llars  Improved financial results were attributed to revenue flow from the =
newly formed Oil and Gas Division, combined with increasing business at the=
 Engineering and Offshore Division. The company's decision to take massive =
voluntary write downs of assets last year also positions the company for in=
creasing profits going forward. Click Here  to read the entire news release=

 XMLG Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Turn Around in its Infancy [IMAGE]=
  [IMAGE]  The recent dramatic rise in the price of XML Global, one of our =
featured companies for 2001, has finally quieted, setting the stage for ano=
ther surge to the upside. XML Global is a leading software company developi=

 viewed as the "Holy Grail" of ecommerce.   Despite the most challenging cl=

 XML Global's fortunes are turning back up. After making a 300% move in fiv=
e trading days, the stock has pulled back a little and quieted down, provid=
ing an excellent entry level for investors looking for powerful turn around=
 situations in the speculative end of the market.   Recent corporate develo=
pments support the notion that now is the time to accumulate this stock. Si=
nce the beginning of November the company has announced three major new con=
tracts- One with the city of Vancouver, one with the Canadian Federal Gover=
nment, and one with HomeSource Capital.    The OTC Journal believes the Hom=
eSource Capital contract to be the most important. XML is viewed by many as=
 the future of interserver communication between corporate computer systems=
. Corporate expansion has slowed to a crawl during this recession, but as s=
oon as IT spending picks up XML Global is positioned to grab a significant =
market share.   While most large corporations are embroiled in a bottoming =

 many other companies will use XML Global software as the business climate =

 While there is some risk of a slight pullback in this stock as a result of=
 year end tax selling, we believe now is the time for bargain basement shop=
pers. The company is gaining the momentum we thought they would have before=

Harriet's Holiday Safety Tips:
In all the excitement of the season, it's easy to forget some common
sense safety measures that are especially important to remember with
trees, lights, and decorations. For a safe holiday, please take a
minute to think about some tips I've found come in handy.

Trees:
?     Select only a freshly cut tree. The needles should not be
      falling off from dryness.
?     Keep the tree outside or in a garage until you're ready to
      decorate it.
?     A diagonal cut in the tree trunk will allow the tree to absorb
      water. This will allow the tree to soak up water from the stand.
?     A 6' tree will use 1 gallon of water every two days, so be sure
      to check the water level daily.
?     Trees should be at least three feet away from heat sources such
      as fireplaces, candles, and radiators, also, never block an exit
      with the tree.
?     Artificial trees should bear the UL label. Never use electric
      lights on metal trees like the old silver trees. To avoid
      electric shock on metal trees, use colored spotlights securely
      mounted above or below the tree, never fastened directly on it.
      Plastic trees should be made of fire resistant material.

 Holiday Lights:
?     Use only U.L. approved tree lights. Check for frayed or bare
      wiring, lights with cracked or broken sockets or loose
      connections. If they show signs of wear and tear, throw them away.
?     Use only UL-listed lights, and no more than 3 strands linked together.
?     Decorations can cause overloaded circuits. Watch for signs of
      lights dimming.
?     Turn off all lights on trees and other decorations when you go to
      bed or leave the house.
?     Keep outdoor electrical connectors above ground and out of puddles and snow.

Tree Ornaments and Trimmings:
?     Avoid placing small or breakable ornaments on lower branches
      where children or pets can reach them and knock them off.
?     Also be careful about putting edible decorations low where
      pets and kids can reach them.

All of us at HarrietCarter.com wish you a safe, happy, and festive
Thanksgiving week and want to leave you with one last idea to make
your guests feel warm and welcome.

Harriet's Cozy Cider:

Pour a container of fresh cider into a large saucepan and heat
gently. You can add a little nutmeg or a few cloves, as well an
orange or lemon peel for a real flavor punch. When guests arrive,
ladle them a mug of hot cider with a cinnamon stick for a stirrer.
It's a great way to say "welcome!"

Relax, sit back, and start your Christmas shopping with
HarrietCarter.com!

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 23, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

or Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Fos=

saac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Char=

2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amoun=

thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probabl=
y won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a =
car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor =
Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed of! f ! the p=
ractice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim D=

 Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and=
 a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and w=
ill help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feel=
eys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from=
 back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the sec=
ond half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys=
 Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week=
, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked r=
ib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throw=
s. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will =
still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys =
Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an=
 ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but re=
turned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/0=
1 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a=
 hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , R=
B SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will pr=
obably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO =

e Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the=
 NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A=
 banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depe=
nd on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes  , WR CAR - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the =
No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however=
, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris We=
inke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup dur=
ing the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average =
numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner=
 , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fant=
asy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the =
rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon h=
as been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many =
title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wo=

 been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your pla=

ntasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Ga=
rdner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very in=
consistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardne=
r isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01=
 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use hi=
m during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated=
 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he i=

 Agent Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improv=
ement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantas=
y teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is =
having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy number=
s makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during yo=
ur playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Harr=

season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in th=

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Mike,

The change in the curves only shows a .60 increase today.  The curves were down anywhere from .60 to 1.65 previous which was supposed to be up .25.  Cin was up @ .15 today.  That would mean that ENT should be up at least the amount it was down the previous day plus any increase marked today.  Can you look into this for me.  This is causing a $2MM hit in the books down here.  Thanks.

-Joe

As you all know by now, the Louisiana Tech game  tomorrow will not be televised.  However, the Missouri game, on the 24th at  11 a.m., will be televised.  There will be an unhosted watch party on that  date at the SRO in Northwest Mall on Hempstead Highway.  Plan to go and  cheer on the team with other Houston K-Staters.
 
Here's wishing you a great Thanksgiving  Holiday!  We'll be in Kansas for turkey dinner!

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

<p><b>Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is scheduled to appear before two
separate Congressional committees</b> next week.  On Friday, we'll have
a <b>preview of Monday's testimony</b> and the <b>latest on the
investigation</b> itself from the Washington bureau.  We'll also take a
look at the impact the Enron situation is having on efforts in Congress
to repeal or amend the <b>Public Utility Holding Company Act</b>.
<p>We'll also have the <b>latest on emissions policy in Congress</b> on
Friday.  With the White House still waiting to release its own ideas on
possible changes in U.S. emissions rules, some in Congress are trying to
move their own legislation.  <b>President of Energy and Environmental
Analysis Joel Bluestein</b> will talk about where he thinks the debate
stands right now.  Bluestein will join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>South Texas College of Law Professor Bruce McGovern</b> will talk
about <b>shareholder lawsuits against Williams</b> from the Houston
bureau on Friday.  McGovern will also explain <b>how these lawsuits
compare to the lawsuits against Enron</b>.
<p>The Houston bureau will continue coverage of a <b>threatened strike
by oil workers</b>.  The <b>workers' union says it will strike at
midnight tonight if contract talks don't progress</b>.  We'll be
following this story that's <b>affecting thousands of workers involved
in Texas</b>.
<p>More earnings from the Houston bureau on Friday - <b>Varco
International CFO Joe Winkler</b> is stopping by the bureau to talk
about his <b>company's earnings report</b> during the 3:00 p.m. ET
newscast.
<p>Friday from the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas talks to
<b>Tuscarora Transmission Company Director of Marketing Greg
Galbraith</b> about the company's plans to <b>expand its gas pipeline
system to northern Nevada</b>, just granted by the FERC this week.
Galbraith will join us during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.
<p>From New York during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast, <b>Merrill Lynch
Director of Energy Research Michael Rothman</b> is penciled in.  He'll
talk about what would happen to the <b>oil markets</b> if the U.S. were
to pursue the expansion of a <b>war on terrorism</b>.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Jou=
rnal Members:      [IMAGE] For OTC Journal Members There Will Be Two SuperB=
owls   This Sunday the St. Louis Rams will square off against the New Engla=
nd Patriots in the most watched television event of the year. The Superbowl=
 is the single most hyped sporting event, and hopefully this year it will b=
e a good game. Hundreds of millions of viewers world wide will have their t=
elevisions tuned in to this event.   The St. Louis Rams are favored by two =
touchdowns, and most odds makers give the Patriots no chance. The SuperBowl=
 has a well deserved reputation for being a blowout, with the outcome decid=
ed by the end of the first half. It's like the Presidential election. The m=
edia decides the outcome with only about 10% of the score being counted. Ho=
pefully this year's SuperBowl will prove as close and entertaining as the l=
ast Presidential Election. Maybe the Supreme Court will have to decide the =
winner.   SuperBowl fans know the commercials can be the most exciting part=
 of the telecast. Advertisers go all out in a creative competition as they =
have the opportunity to get their message to largest imaginable audience.  =
 Fans of the OTC Journal will have the opportunity to watch one SuperBowl t=
his weekend, and play in one next week. As we continue to remind you, our n=
ext profile will come out toward the end of next week, and we believe this =
stock will be the SuperBowl of small cap stocks for our members.   The stoc=
k will begin trading sometime between Wednesday and Friday, and check our h=
ome page frequently for an update. As soon as the stock opens for trading w=
e will hit the send button on the mail server. It will take about six hours=
 for the newsletter to deploy, and as always there can be technology delays=
 on the Internet.   However, the banner on our home page will update you au=
tomatically, and you will be able to simply click on it to read the profile=
 when the stock opens for trading. Hopefully we will be able to provide a m=
ore precise time frame in an edition early next week.     [IMAGE] Small And=
 MicroCap Stocks Avoid Wall Street Carnage This Week [IMAGE]  The latest GD=
P and Unemployment figures came out stronger than expected this week, leadi=
ng investors to believe the end of the recession is right on schedule.   Ho=
wever, this good news was overshadowed by scandal related selling early in =
the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were clobbered early in the week, slipping bel=
ow 9700 and 1900 respectively.   The thinking on Wall Street was dominated =
by the belief that the Enron accounting scandal was just the tip of the ice=
berg, and other company's financial statements would come under increased s=
crutiny.    Behemoth multi national Tyco (NYSE: TYC) was annihilated early =
in the week on fears they have been cooking the books. It was disclosed one=
 of their directors received a $20 million payment for arranging an acquisi=
tion. Many feel this was a blatant conflict of interest.   Telecommunicatio=
ns giant Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) filed bankruptcy this week. Chairman Ga=
ry Winnick has taken $600 million off the table personally in the last five=
 years. Quite a reward for failure.   Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) announ=
ced a $1.7 billion non cash charge to earnings in order to correct previous=
 accounting issues. The stock fell nearly 8% on the news.   ImClone Systems=
 (NASDAQ: IMCL) is being investigated by the SEC and the Justice Department=
. The company is accused of misleading investors on the highly touted colon=
 cancer drug Erbitux. CEO Samuel Waksal told investors on a conference call=
 that he was "stunned'' at the FDA's decision to refuse the cancer drug app=
lication for Erbitux. However a copy of the FDA's rejection letter was obta=
ined by The Cancer Letter. It suggests Waksal and his brother Harlan knew, =
or should have known, that the FDA had serious concerns about the way the c=
ompany conducted a key clinical trial. Harlan Waksal filed a Form 144 with =
the SEC on Dec. 6 to sell $52 million worth of ImClone stock.   Wall Street=
 is afraid earnings and accounting scandals will dominate financial news fo=
r some time to come. Arthur Andersen generated $50 million in accounting fe=
es from Enron last year, and companies like Enron have a lot of muscle with=
 their auditors. In order to win the business, the consulting arm comes up =
with the tax avoidance scheme and earnings enhancement method, and the audi=
ting division implements the strategy.    Like a weight lifter taking stero=
ids, large cap companies are addicted to beefing up their financial perform=
ance at any cost. And just like the weightlifter taking steroids, this perf=
ormance enhancement is not only toxic long term, it is also illegal.   In t=
he small and micro cap arena there is significant risk associated with fail=
ed corporate performance. However, these smaller companies do not have the =
fiscal muscle to make their auditors bend the rules to enhance financial pe=
rformance. You won't see many small company scandals associated with accoun=
ting irregularities. Their auditors take a much more conservative approach,=
 as the auditor is more concerned with covering his own butt than collectin=
g the reduced fees.   During this past week, while Wall Street was annihila=
ting several of its large cap favorites, Cross Media (AMEX: XMM) and Energy=
 Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) both traded up. Small stocks still remain a preferre=
d and level playing field for individual investors.    Charts Provided Cour=

pdated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he m=
ay be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bet=
tis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Stewa=
rt , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle=
 early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in =
the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO -=
 Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday=
. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Car=
sons Wildcats Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quart=
er with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman =
, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01  Bouman was able to start Sunday's g=
ame, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by S=
pergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Walls=
 was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the=
 game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K=
 TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the=
 fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica =
is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Up=
dated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He shoul=
d be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in h=
is thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham prob=
ably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in=
 a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trev=
or Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the pr=
actice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dw=
ight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and =
a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and wi=
ll help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair  , QB TEN - Feel=
eys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from=
 back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the sec=
ond half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys=
 Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week=
, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked r=
ib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throw=
s. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will =
still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys =
Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an=
 ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but re=
turned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/0=
1 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a=
 hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , R=
B SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will pr=
obably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO =
- Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elit=
e Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the=
 NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A=
 banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depe=
nd on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent=
 Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the N=
o. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however,=
 and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Wei=
nke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup duri=
ng the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average n=
umbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner =
, QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fanta=
sy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the r=
est of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon ha=
s been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many t=
itle teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Won=
ders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again =
been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your play=
off run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis ha=
sn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the r=
emaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook  , WR WAS - Damons Do=

What's up Carson? I'd be up for a little Miami. Let me know if anything
develops with respect to this idea.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

SPP is proposing a new credit policy which may affect our credit requirements.
 
I have already informed Mike Carson, who will be analyzing the commercial implications.
 
In the mean time, to expedite things, I am also sending you the new SPP Credit Policy.

Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) continues to make changes to its Credit 
Policy to reflect changes in overall market conditions. The current Credit 
Policy was posted on our web site on November 14, 2001. It reflects a marked 
shift in the way SPP has administered its Credit Policy in the past. 

SPP wants all of our customers to be made aware of this change and we want 
to give each  a certain period of time to make the necessary adjustments in 
any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit 
Policy for your review. We ask that it be directed to the proper person 
within your organization to assure that your company is compliant with all 
conditions of the Credit Policy. We ask that you also complete the attached 
Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or 
your ability to make future reservations. 

If you have any questions concerning the new policy please feel free to 
contact me.  I look forward to working with you to make these changes as 
smooth as possible.

    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break do=
wn the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing=
 a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier co=
ver-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safetie=
s. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups i=
n every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check o=

stions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite yo=
u to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@co=
mmissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =
players just like yourself!   =09


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=
rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =
Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=
r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=
nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=
nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=
 not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=
o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =
going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=
nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=
ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=
 Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=
 best, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

  On playing KU, a rival school:
I would like to think, no matter who you were going to line up, that there would be a tremendous amount of motivation to become better, to have success. I think that's why we play the game, I think that's why youngsters play the game, and I think under any circumstances that they would be motivated to do so. I would hope that it would be that way. Does that make it true or not? Not necessarily, I think what you say, John, makes sense that if there is a need for additional motivation beyond what they have, maybe this traditional rival game could provide that.

MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throw=
ing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and =
is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's mat=
chup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanat=
ics Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a fa=
mily illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Clevel=
and, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chi=
cago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy se=
ason.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) =
is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to s=
tart at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR C=
AR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this =
week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in =
his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Chargers Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn =
Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunda=
y against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing t=
ime will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/=
29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injur=
y. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pac=
kers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last =
week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep in=
to the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01=
 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquir=
ing Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterba=
ck, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move w=
ould certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely b=
e made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monk=
eys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's =
game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insu=
rance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.=
   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is=
 day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile A=
lstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Mic=
hael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's stat=
us is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Ma=
rTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his se=
cond consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would =
replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He =
is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated =
12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie Da=
vid Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he i=
s healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red =
zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has=
 been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injur=
y may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Up=
dated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expe=
cted to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will b=
e less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Up=
dated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still =
expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Horn =
suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to=
 start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea =
(shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue =
to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BA=
L - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and =
is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week =
17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may mi=
ss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third=
 downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , =
WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practic=
e on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - =
Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a kne=
e injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL=
 - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will cont=
inue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas w=
ill continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free =
Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is ex=
pected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 1=
2/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this=
 week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a f=
ew snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full stre=
ngth" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to =
start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's prac=
tice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when pl=
ayers work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the=
 regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snap=
s than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in th=
e closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Upda=
ted 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice =
field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach B=
ill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go=
 from there. We'll take it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Up=
dated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tam=
pa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica c=
an't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 =
victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out fo=
r Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have =
a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   More Updates  Sche=

Dear Body Shop Members,
"Healthy Habits for the Holidays" October 22nd - December 14th

Week Five - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   "Take Five"  It takes only 5-minutes to recharge your batteries with renewed energy.
Relax and sit in a comfortable chair.
If possible close your door and your eyes.
Slowly take deep breaths, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
Focus on a beautiful scene, special moment, happy occasion, or warm feeling.
Taking a few of these mini-breaks throughout your day will help you remain focused, calm, cool and collected.
Weight Management:  Fat Free Cookies
Don't be fooled by the term "fat free" on a food label.  While there are a myriad of fat free products on the market today, many of them are loaded with calories and concentrated sugars.  May fat free versions of foods contain only a few less calories per serving then their fatty counterparts.  Five fat free cookies 50 calories each still adds up to a significant caloric intake.  Be a smart shopper.  Compare calorie and fat contents when choosing products and practice moderation when eating high sugar or high fat foods. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Congrats to:  Pete Prelli -Winner of Week Four Massage & Kenneth Mathis - Winner of Week Four Enron Travel Bag

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

>No. 7 Present Day Program: Kansas State
>
>Athlon has ranked the Top 10 college football programs of the present day.
>In order to best determine the current health of a program without merely
>copying the final 2001 polls, both of which (AP and Coaches) are identical
>from No. 1 through No. 14, we have examined a time depth of from five to
ten
>years. This will also serve the purpose of weeding out the possible "flash
>in the pan," a one- or two-year phenomenon. The program must demonstrably
>stand on solid ground. Win-loss records, success against highly ranked
>opponents, conference domination and repeatedly high rankings all were
taken
>into consideration. And now, without further adieu, here are our findings.
>
>No. 10 Present Day Program: Oklahoma
>No. 9 Present Day Program: Oregon
>No. 8 Present Day Program: Virginia Tech
>
>
>No. 7 College Football Program of the Present Day
>Kansas State
>
>Some coaches are synonymous with their schools' rise to prominence.
>Florida's Steve Spurrier and Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer are two such
>coaches. Add Bill Snyder to the list.
>
>In 1989, Snyder took over as head coach of the worst program in
>major-college football. Kansas State was mired so deeply at the bottom of
>the all-time winning percentage list that as recently as 1996, after
winning
>28 games in the previous three years, the NCAA Football Records Book still
>ranked the Wildcats dead last at .394. But in the most recent standings,
>K-State stood at .422, fourth from the bottom and climbing steadily.
>
>Snyder came to Manhattan from Hayden Fry's staff at Iowa in 1989 with
Kansas
>State stuck in an 0-26-1 rut. Snyder's first campaign in as the Wildcats'
>head man wasn't much better at 1-10, but the one win was one more than they
>had registered in almost three years.
>
>In the 35 years previous to Snyder's arrival, the Wildcats won 97 games. In
>the 13 years since, they've won 105. They are one of only two Division I-A
>programs to have won 11 or more games in each season from 1997-2000
(Florida
>State is the other), and they posted nine or more wins eight straight years
>from 1993-2000.
>
>The Wildcats' 6-6 mark this season is their worst since 1992. From
>1993-2000, they never finished lower than third in the Big Eight/Big
>12-North standings. They won three straight Big 12 North championships in
>1998, 1999 and 2000. That's the same division as Nebraska.
>
>In 1997, Kansas State posted the first 11-win campaign in its history and
>followed it up with three more. In 1997 and '98, the Wildcats strung
>together a 20-game winning streak, including an 11-0 regular season in
1998,
>before dropping the Big 12 championship game to Texas A&M 36-33 in double
>overtime. Following the 1998 season, Snyder was named National Coach of the
>Year by consensus.
>
>During the 1990s, Kansas state posted a 63-6-1 record at KSU Stadium, the
>fifth-best home record in the nation during that decade.
>
>In 93 years of football competition before Snyder, K-State had played in
one
>bowl game - the 1982 Independence Bowl. The Wildcats have now been bowling
>nine straight years. In 1993, Snyder's fifth year in Manhattan, came the
>school's first bowl win, a 52-17 shellacking of Wyoming in the Copper Bowl.
>In the 2001 Cotton Bowl, the Wildcats mugged Tennessee 35-21 in a game that
>wasn't as close as the score indicated.
>
>The health of the Kansas State program promises an upswing in 2002 from
this
>year's disappointing showing. A dozen years ago, a 6-6 record would have
>been considered a crowning achievement at K-State. These days it is a
>disaster, and it still gets the Wildcats into the postseason.

   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  Our last Trading Alert on September 5th was Cross Media=
 Marketing at $1.30. The stock traded up to $1.65 for a 27% return five day=
s after our release, making many of our members very happy with a nice shor=
t term gain. In fact, we are convinced the stock would have continued highe=
r had the September 11th disaster not derailed the entire market.   Just li=
ke the stray cat you have fed, the OTC Journal is back for more as we had s=
uch a great meal the first time around.   Cross Media closed at $6.70 today=
, but it is really back at the $1.30 level from September 5th. The company =
completed its merger with Lifeminders on October 25th and did a 1 for 5 rev=
erse stock split. Therefore, split adjusted the stock has returned to the $=
1.30 level we had so much success with the first time around.   Breaking ne=
ws on the company just after the market closed today puts Cross Media back =
on our radar screen. The OTC Journal is bringing this breaking news to you =
first.   With the Lifeminders merger finally completed, Cross Media is now =
positioned to enlighten us about future performance. The company revealed t=
oday that it anticipates 50% organic growth in 2002, leading to revenues in=
 excess of $150 million, and EBITDA earnings of $23 million. Net earnings a=
re expected to be $15 million, or $1.15 per share post reverse split.   For=
 investors who still believe in looking at PE Ratios, the stock is therefor=
e trading at 5.8 times projected 2002 net earnings with a 50% growth rate. =
Here is an excerpt from today's news release:     Preliminary projections c=
all for the Company achieving record revenues and earnings for the year end=
ing December 31, 2002.  Revenues are projected to be in excess of $150 mill=
ion, representing a 50% increase over expected revenues for 2001.  The reve=
nue projection is based on organic growth from all operations and do not gi=
ve effect to any potential acquisitions.   Net income is expected to grow i=
n excess of 50% resulting in a minimum of $15 million of net earnings and $=
1.15 earnings per share based on a fully diluted base of approximately 13 m=
illion common shares outstanding. EBITDA (defined as earnings before intere=
st, taxes, goodwill, amortization, interest charges and non-cash operating =
expense) is projected to be in excess of $23 million compared to calendar 2=
001's projection of $16 million to $18 million.        [IMAGE] Recent Devel=
opments [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  We have interviewed management extensively about =
the state of their business, and have learned the company has benefited dra=
matically from the Attack on America.   Since the attack, consumers are sta=
ying home more. Ratings on TV shows are up, and rental activity at Blockbus=
ter is exploding. People are more prone to consume their entertainment and =
media at home. This is a mega trend that analysts expect to continue.   The=
 company describes itself as "a technology- driven cross media marketing co=
mpany integrating its sophisticated direct marketing skills with cutting-ed=
ge technologies, including interactive voice response and web-based systems=
, resulting in a multi-dimensional marketing platform for the international=
 exploitation of products and services."   Cross Media had the most success=
ful week in its history just after September 11th. Magazine subscription sa=
les, which represent 75% of the company's revenues, went through the roof. =
Consumers were demonstrating a desire to stay at home and be informed.   Wi=
th market conditions improving, investors are seeking undervalued situation=
s with real growth. Cross Media, head quartered just a few miles from the W=
all Street Financial district, is bound to end up on the radar screens of i=
nstitutional investors now that the stock has been recapitalized into the $=
6.75 range where fund managers will look at it.     [IMAGE] Trading Alert D=
etails [IMAGE]  Here are our thoughts on this Trading Alert on Cross Media =
Marketing (AMEX: XMM).   The early September move in the stock from the hig=
h $6's to nearly $9 came in conjunction with the OTC Journal's last Trading=
 Alert on the stock. According to the company, earnings for 2002 will come =
in at about $1.22 per share. At $6.75 this makes the stock ridiculously und=
ervalued. The first analyst report on the company was issued August 30th, p=
rojecting $27 (split adjusted) in 18 to 24 months. The stock is sitting dir=
ectly on its support line with volume increasing. Clearly, it is under accu=
mulation and today's news could be the required catalyst to move this stock=
 to the upside.  Buy up to $7.25 which gives you room to make money if the =
stock trades in our favor. If you can get in under $7 it would be ideal. Ve=
ry low risk entry level. Set your Stop Loss at $6.00 to give you some room =
for a short term pullback or what ever your risk tolerance is. If the stock=
 can get through $8.50 in the next few weeks should go higher it could find=
 its way to nearly $10 with a little luck and favorable market conditions. =
A move to $8.50 would be the same percentage return we provided from our la=
st Trading Alert on this stock. Because of their growth and profitability y=
ou can comfortably put this one in your long term speculative portfolio.   =
 The OTC Journal intends to publish follow-up editions on this company. Thi=
s stock has the potential to be a huge winner.   This newsletter is our opi=
nion only, and not a solicitation to buy this stock. Make up your own mind.=
 If you are looking for a short term trade limit your loss if the stock goe=
s against you. As always, we remind you before making any investment decisi=
ons please review the section on our home page on Trading Alerts.  Read our=
 section on Successful Microcap Investing , paying particular attention to =
the Trading Strategies Section. The track record on our previous alerts can=
 be obtained by clicking here.    In the interest of full disclosure we inf=

layer News  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Damons Doormats Updated 10/16/01 Has=
selbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Mi=
ami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has had=
 a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he =
has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer=
. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially =
against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free =
Agent Upda! te! d 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's g=
ame against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 ag=
ainst Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "There's more to =
it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that," Seahawks He=
ad Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He's injured, and he won't practice th=
is week." Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don'=
t expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Ric=
hardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermei=
l said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, ac=
cording to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury. =
 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an M=
RI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his=
 right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.=
  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walk=
ing boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the =
Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when =
the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nut=
s Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for =
Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI M=
onday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no ti=
e to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday'=
s practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte t=
o get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Johnso=
n has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a=
 neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and t=
here's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson. =
 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent s=
uccessful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson=
 has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of=
 the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/16=
/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets=
 despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," c=
oach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playi=
ng completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will =
be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decis=
ion on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation=
 t! hr! oughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated =
10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his =
ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the an=
kle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the=
 rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie=
 Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver us=
ed mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suff=
ered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.  D=
ennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach B=
utch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of pla=
ying time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too pr=
oductive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.=
   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed a=
s probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bru=
ised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/0=
1 Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He i=
s suffering from a strained left shoulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Powers =
Rangers Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Mon=
day, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years i=
n the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the gr=
ound by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23=
 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the gam=
e, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minu=
tes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself f! it! enoug=
h to play. "I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every fe=
w hours to see if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be re=
ady."      Redskins , DT WAS - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Washington corne=
rback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against=
 Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently li=
sted as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16=
/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to=
 Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as d=
ay-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/16/01 Accor=
ding to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Mo=
nday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split ca=
rries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy=
-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Jureviciu=
s suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury =
is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the start=
ing lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg =
or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman=
 that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman st=
ated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week=
, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 wi=
n over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should hav=
e amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.  =
  Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a =
hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game =
after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , T=
E DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Mo=
nday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and =
has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to rep=
air the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday!=
 . ! He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Ra=
ghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned t=
o action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches=
 for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barb=
er , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to=
 return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be avail=
able for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayn=
e, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming week=
s.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/16/01 Pittman s=
uffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with =
headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is st=
atus for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the =
week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB ro=
le once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/16/01 Moss=
 is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at=
 full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Mos=
s, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your=
 roster allows for a! s! olid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free A=
gent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this week=
end against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be=
 worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed=
 to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.   Michael Bennett=
 , RB MIN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/16/01 According to the Minneapolis St=
ar-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against=
 Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking wit!=
 h ! a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's=

There is NO Tuesday markets available today.  We can not wire cash on Monday due to the holiday.  So, Koch will allow us to make to them an "estimate payment",,, aprox $250,000.  We will cover the postions on Monday.  The difference in actual will be netted out of Tuedays payment.

laced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Char=
gers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained =
only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most o=
f the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The=
 Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thur=
sday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just=
 eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    J=
ames Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for=
 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger i=
n his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ank=
le, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch, QB DET - Damons Doorm=
ats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an=
 interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in th=
e first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he=
 couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status f=
or next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver=
, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's ga=
me at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but a=
ll his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the=
 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod =
Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches f=
or 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over=
 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receive=
r in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Ju=
gg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has =
missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary , RB DE=
N - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on th=
e second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the sea=
son. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be abl=
e to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/0=
1 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against =
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch =
a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss=
 of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output o=
ver the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every we=
ek in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rus=
h defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may eve=
n find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updat! ed! 11/21/0=
1 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has be=
en very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Update=
d 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, S=
tewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He f=
aces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but onl=
y use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackso=
n , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at K=
ansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open =
up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver fo=
r Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01 =
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield=
 in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your=
 active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Update=
d 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against t! he! Giants o=
n Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough=
 on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your =
roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten an=
d the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been incons=
istent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten c=
ould beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using =
him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this seaso=
n, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the bal=
l. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.=
  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a p=
leasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a =
subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into you=
r active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/21/01 Gadsden has been ve! ry! inconsistent this season, and we don't =
recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself be=
fore you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of=
 the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There i=
s a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long pass=
es on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis=
 Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a =
fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be =
worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run=
 all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez =
will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has b=
een somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  =
Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 =
yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone ! on! ce a=
gain. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no =
choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around t=
he league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker coul=
d get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary h=
as regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a =
good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent g=
ames, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday=
. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a =
deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your l=
ineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs =
will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which shoul=
d help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get =
him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week =
Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC! -! Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Green and the =
Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday again=
st Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secon=
dary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  M=

I thought all of you would enjoy this. I got it from a wonderful friend in
Richmond,VA. He and his wife share with many of you in that I was honored to
perform their wedding ceremony.
Hope to see all of you at Church.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

son , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second h=
alf of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a ri=
ght knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing wi=
th a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an =
MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are s=
aying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably cou=
ld not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmit=
t Smith! , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK de=
spite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory =
over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be=
 all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the =
degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk o=
ff the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at th=
e New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Mon=
day, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte Cu=
lpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 According to published =
reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Ba=
y. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - P=
owers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards agains=
t New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted b=
ack to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike An=
derson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 4=
0 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-y! ar!=
 d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught fi=
ve passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scori=
ng threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Tr=
oy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes f=
or 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 ya=
rds. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive te=
ams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated =
10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pa=
st, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie=
 and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a =
Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01=
 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two =
passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and J=
ones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems=
 to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside th=
e red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers=
 was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bil=
ls ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemers=
ma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  =
, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 ya=
rds and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to=
 have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hassel=
beck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as=
 a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he contin=
ued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfi=
eld on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consid=
ering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked r=
espectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post=
 good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his ove=
rall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsd=
en caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is n=
ot playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James Mc=
Knight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes =
for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receive=
r continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG =
- Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carrie=
s by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should=
 not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens =
Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and ! a ! =
TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter wh=
at the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/=
01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the e=
nd zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins conti=
nue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks =
, QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs=
 and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playin=
g well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feel=
eys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was =
held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 =
yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should po=
st better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buck=
halter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back =
is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Ga=
rner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for=
 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him=
 firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remain=
s sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passe=
d for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game a=
t Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, an=
d we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McN=
abb  , QB PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 y=
ards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepte=
d either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raide=
rs' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a s=
lump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quart=
erback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cars=
ons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sun=
day at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, an=
d we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the re=
mainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/=
01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. Whil=
e Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspect=
ive, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in=
 the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team. =
 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 2=
33 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, f=
urther exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates o=
therwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinal=
s to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in t=
he game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspectiv=
e based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believ=
ing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  C!=
 li! nt Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed =
9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushin=
g for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona=
. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a=
 weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based=
 on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Smith l=
eft Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right k=
nee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be ev=
aluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnso=
n left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He =
was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replac=

Boys, 

I'd be delighted to gather and format all of the information for a "nice and pretty" presentation. I would just ask that you e-mail me your info by the end of Wednesday, Feb. 6. 

Gracias,

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

Flet

	MAIN (ComEd) - Ave'

      <p>Dear Michael,</p>
<!-- This mail was sent to "Michael Carson" <mike.carson@enron.com>, who belongs to list
enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>The <b>General Accounting Office</b> made it official on Wednesday -
the investigative arm of Congress will <b>sue Vice President Dick
Cheney</b> over his <b>refusal to turn over information</b> related to
the work of his <b>energy task force</b>.  The GAO wants to know with
whom the task force met, especially within the energy industry.  The
<b>White House insists the request is inappropriate</b> and promises to
put up a fight.  On Thursday from the Washington bureau, we'll hear
where this dispute is headed.
<p>The Washington bureau will also have the latest on the Congressional
investigation into Enron.  Several new <b>Enron hearings</b> have been
added to next week's Congressional calendar.  <b>Two big hearings</b>
are scheduled for Monday and former <b>Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is expected
to make an appearance at both</b>.  This will be the <b>first time any
Enron executive has testified before Congress</b>.
<p>West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas will speak one-on-one
with <b>Southern California Edison President Bob Foster</b> Thursday.
He'll discuss <b>SoCal Edison's road to recovery</b> during 1:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p>On Thursday from Houston, <b>Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny
Parkins</b> will join us to <b>provide legal analysis on the latest
Enron developments</b>.  Parkins is stopping by the bureau during the
noon ET newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>Energy Intelligence Group Bureau Chief Barbara Shook talks about
LNG projects</b>.  Some of the <b>projects that were scheduled to come
online in the U.S.</b> are now being <b>placed on the back burner due to
low gas prices</b>.  Catch Shook from the Houston bureau on Thursday.
<p>Finally from the NASDAQ in New York, <b>Tyumen Oil Company President
and CEO Simon Kukes</b> will join us.  He'll give us the <b>lowdown on
Russian oil issues</b> at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Dear Investor,

The long bear market turned bullish on September 21, 2001.
And few profited as handsomely from this turnaround as
subscribers to Steve Harmon's Broadband Investor did. For
example:

September 17, 2001: Steve Harmon tells his subscribers:
"clearly more has to be done in the area of travel security."
He issues buy signs on eight travel security stocks.

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
"One of the top 10 online commentators." Why Smart Money lauds
him as "One of three rising stars in technology investing."

And start getting your share of the post-September 2001 rebound
today! Take a no-risk 30-day FREE trial to Broadband Investor.

EPMI and EES -- Attached is information regarding changes effective December 15 to SPP's credit policy.  SPP requests that Enron (EPMI and EES if necessary) return a new credit agreement.

Please let us know if we can assist with this.  Thanks.  Christi 37007

Chris

As per your request, I examined the new SPP credit policy and creditworthness standards.

I tried to compare with previous versions, but I did not find any. I just encountered vague references on chapter 11 of the Open Acess Transmission Tariff document. Apparently, there is more posted on Oasis.

I contacted SPP and the response I got from Phil follows. He also copied Michael Jacobson.

Who else should receive this information? The new policy is effective December 15.

Thanks for your continued guidance.

Luiz,

I received your forwarded voice mail and email you had sent to Sherry
Jenson.  Thanks for looking at the credit policy.  The answer to your
question is that there has never been this much detail available on our
credit policy.  I would say to just use the one posted now would be the best
thing to do.

I did not know who would need to see the policy at your company so I sent
the following email to Michael Jacobson at your company.  If there is
anything further I can do for you feel free to let me know.

 Michael,

If you are not the proper person to receive this request will you please
forward it to the proper person within your organization.  

We have recently made significant changes to our credit policy and we have
requested all customers be compliant with the credit policy by December 15
of this year.  I have attached a copy of the credit policy reflecting these
changes for your review.  

After reviewing your company's last 24 calendar months of activity it would
appear that we will need a letter of credit in the amount of at least
$100,000 for you to be compliant with the terms of the policy.  Approved
language for the letter of credit is at the end of the credit policy as
attachment 2.  The issuing bank must also be acceptable to SPP and these
requirements can be located in the financial security section of the policy
under Letter of Credit.  Also, we have mailed and emailed the policy with a
request to send back the credit agreement.  I have also attached a copy of
this agreement.  If you would have it signed and sent back as well it would
be greatly appreciated.

OTC Investor News has heard reports that Synergetics Tecnologies may be acquiring a bulletin board listing very soon.

Synergetic Technologies, Inc. announced in a press release on Monday February 4th that the company will begin beta testing of its airline security and anti-terrorism system. OTC Investor News has also heard a rumor that the company may be heading into a bulletin board entity in a very short timeframe. Share volume for the past six weeks is reflective of increased business activity and momentum as the stock has gained in price over the past two weeks and the potential for share appreciation seems quite positive.

OTC Investor News believes that immediate near term share appreciation will take place - Here's why:

* OTC Investment News has learned that strong support is coming in from European investors.

* SYGE has recently announced contract negotiations for substantial anti-terrorist system sales - we believe that many more contracts are on their way.

* SYGE recently announced the acquisition of Custom Broadband - completing the technical infrastructure required to deploy the anti-terror system in aircraft.

* OTC Investment News  Believes that a bulletin board listing is imminent. Typically, listing on the BB will enhance the share value.

* SYGE is near the low end of the price spectrum and is seeing record trading volume at this time. OTC Investment News  believes that there will not be a more opportune time to accumulate a position in this company.
***********************************************************
Equity Data for SYGE
Market Capitalization: U.S. $1 Million at current price
Shares Outstanding: 20,152,869 shares issued
Float 2,000,000 (approximate)
Current Share Price: $0.05
60 Day Target Price $.10
***********************************************************

Conclusion: OTC Investment News  believes that SYGE is well positioned to make a short term run. We are looking at a near term price target of $0.10 and mid term target of $0.18.

Hi Everyone,
 
Charles asked me to email you guys, because he does not have  access to his email for a while.  For Nov. 1 he would like for you to read  John 1:1-18 (if not the whole chapter).  See you then!
 
:), Melissa and Charles, Jr.

Since Randy is soooo busy and  can't
send out an email on  a trade he made, 
I'll have to do it  for him.
 
He drops WR Pathon and adds TE  Pollard.
 
PS Did anyone notice how I kicked the  hell
out of the Drunk Monkeys this weekend?
 
DeWayne (you Aggie redneck), you're
next.

If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the "My Documents" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the "My Documents" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

Why do all of you lazy f*cks fail to  follow
the directions below? What I am referring  to
is making a trade. The directions were as  follows:
 
1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction, click  on the "Owners" tab
on the league homepage (found up top next to Live  Chat), page down
to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to ALL team  members
announcing your  intentions. I will implement the trade(s) on the Tuesday  following
the Monday night game. The transaction deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the  weekend
games. If I receive the email timestamped  before then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday night  game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time  after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on
the amount of transactions, feel free to contribute  as much as you wish.
 
The next jackass that submits for a  trade transaction and does NOT braodcast
it to everybody in the league will be  ignored. Gill and Farley, take note.

ONLY THREE DAYS UNTIL THE BIG  DAY!
 
WHAT BIG DAY?, YOU ASK
 
Of course, it is the 3rd annual  KANSAS  KLASH
 
WHERE
 
SRO at Northwest Mall
290 and 610 Loop West
 
WHEN
 
Monday night, February 4
8:00 p.m.
 
ADMISSION
 
Please bring a couple cans of food or boxes of nonperishable  food items for the Northwest Assistance Ministries Food Pantry.  Houston  citizens need our help.
 
This is our annual meeting with the University of Kansas  Alumni Club.  Door prizes will be given away.  Come support our  team!  They were victorious last night in Manhattan against a ranked Texas  team. The 'Hawks better watch out!  The Wildcats are on a  roll!
-----------------------------------
All club activities are approved by the Kansas  State University Alumni Association.
-----------------------------------
 
Some club news - As I have said before, Ken and I are  "retiring" (after the Kansas Klash) from our leadership role in the  Houston club.  We have enjoyed it all but feel it is time for some new  ideas and new outlook.  And time for us to do other things!  Aaron  Brammer '95, Angie Benson '01, and Amber Clark '97 will be sharing the  leadership responsibilities.  Please be willing to give these young people  a hand when they ask or when they need it.  We are so pleased to have  Aaron, Angie and Amber take over the core committee and the club  activities.  I guess we could call them the Triple A's - they are coming to  the rescue.  Thanks again for your support all these years. Hope you can  come to the Kansas Klash and meet the Triple A's!  
 
Go 'Cats

Dear Graduate Brothers,
            Things have been a little hectic around here lately.  In the last two weeks we have had Dad's Weekend, Homecoming, and FIJI Run.  We are all just now getting back into the normal routine.  There have been many positive things happening around here though:
 
Dad's Weekend we a huge success, except for K-State losing to Texas A&M.  All the Dad's a great time hanging out with there son's and learning what type of brotherhood we have developed here.
 
FIJI Run was also very successful.  This year it was the same week as homecoming so we chose to run the ball from Lawrence to Manhattan on Monday instead of Friday.  Between the two chapters we raised over $32,000, with $18,500 coming from Chi Deuteron alone.
 
Homecoming was a good time as always.  Our partners weren't too much help this year, but the Phi Gams represented well, and made it as crazy as ever.
 
5-8 of us will be traveling to William Woods in Fulton, MO this weekend for their chartering.  Three members will be on the initiation team there.  If anyone is interested in attending the festivities, email Terry Meyers at tmeyers@ussafety.com .  
 
Fraternally,
 
Kurt Niebuhr
Recording Secretary

development. Members of the OTC Journal will be the first to learn of this,=
 giving you the competitive investing edge. Hopefully, we will start the Ne=

d Update on XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  XML Gl=
obal's year was a microcosm of the B to B sector on the NASDAQ, which was p=
ounded into oblivion. In the late 90's Wall Street's enormous appetite for =
technology IPOs created an excess supply of technology in this sector, most=
 of which becomes obsolete sooner than companies can get it to customers.  =
 The shrinking economy forced a significant contraction of IT budgets at la=
rge corporations, and the market for XML Global's products vaporized tempor=
arily. XML is a new universal computer language which allows large systems =
to communicate directly with each other. Analysts have long recognized this=
 new language will eventually dominate the B to B space. Most importantly- =
the implementation of this language saves companies money over the long run=
, making its adoption inevitable.   However, after having survived a challe=
nging environment, business seems to be turning the corner at XML Global. T=
his small company has garnered an unusual amount of high profile publicity =
on its products. The December 24th edition of Business Week carried a featu=
re on the company's stolen property tracking software, Xtract. Click Here  =
to read the article. If you have a copy of the magazine, the article can be=
 found on page 75.   The stock dropped all the way from $1 to just under $.=
20, but has since come off the canvas and tripled. Expect the company to co=
ntinue to announce more positive fundamental developments in the first quar=
ter of 2002 as the long awaited XML revolution finally begins to take hold.=

up provides outsourced coding services for hospitals. Their business evolve=
d out of the medicare related fraudulent practices of health care providers=
 in the late 1980's and early 1990's.   We have always liked this company a=
s they have been consistently profitable and nearly doubled in size every y=
ear for the past three years.   The company embarked on an aggressive expan=
sion plan in the first quarter, gearing up staff to handle a significant in=
crease in business from a large, Houston based hospital chain.   Towards th=
e end of the summer the expansion was derailed by serious flooding in the H=
ouston area, which led to the closing of several hospitals. Shortly thereaf=
ter the September 11th Attack on America also slowed new contract roll outs=
.   New business is back on track, and the company should report a relative=
ly strong fourth quarter. Business should accelerate next year, and the com=
pany should easily exceed the $10 million revenue mark in 2002. Overstaffin=
g for delayed contract roll outs hurt their performance in 2001, but the de=
lays are now in the past.   This company has a unique market niche. There i=
s no other company which specializes in outsourced coding for hospitals. In=
 our opinion, this company is a good candidate for a merger or acquisition =
of some kind in 2002, which could put the stock on the map.   Charts Provid=

  Opening comments from Head Coach Jim Wooldridge...
"Practice is underway. We've practiced four days, and we feel good about those days. We like the way our kids are competing, we've improved our ball club, but in a sense, I guess that all remains to be seen. We're walking into this year optimistic about improving, and that will be our approach."

FYI, 



Reagan C. Rorschach


Reagan:

I wanted to confirm that you have received Mayor Hays' letter of 11/2
detailing the process we intend to follow in concluding the RFP process.  If
you have not received Mayor Hays' letter or have any questions, please give
me a call.

Additionally, I want to confirm some information with you.

1. In your proposal you stated that you would utilized firm contracts inside
Entergy as sources for supplying NLR & Benton.  Can you identify the sources
you would initially point to for submission of the Network Transmission
Service request.

2. Confirm our understanding that your price includes Schedules 3 - 6 costs.

3.  Please identify each major party associated with Enron's proposal and
describe the role of each including contracting party, parent company of
contracting party if different, owner of resources if different and any
other parties that would have a role in the proposed transaction.

4. As you know Benton does not have a SCADA system. We are unsure about
bringing their metering points into our SCADA system.  Do you have a per
metering point price estimate to acquire the metering information directly
from Benton.

I know this is short notice but if you could respond by close of business
11/6 it would be appreciated.

Hello all:

The time has come again for Bowl for Kid's Sake!  Entergy-Koch is sponsoring
the event this year which will raise money for the children of Big
Brothers-Big Sisters of Greater Houston.  BBBS offers youth mentoring
programs to at-risk children, and their goal is to match children from
single-parent families with responsible, adult role models.

Last year, our team raised over $1500, and this year our team goal is $3000.
The company goal is to raise $350,000 in total.  The minimum pledge per pin
is $.10 (100 score minimum), or a flat pledge of $10.  Either method works,
but be careful on the pledge per pin donation (I have been studying the
moves of Roy Munson and Ernie McCracken from the movie Kingpin).

If you are interested, please reply with your phone number, address, and
pledge amount (you will be billed directly in the mail by BBBS).

For those of you who are also interested in supporting our efforts in
person, the fundraiser will take place on Thursday, March 7th  from
2:00-4:30 at Palace Lanes, 4191 Bellaire Blvd (713-667-6554).

Thanks again to those who could contribute last year.  We hope to have just
as much success this time!

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Military Resale Group, Inc.
Corporate Profile:	     January 2002
2180 Executive Circle

Colorado Springs, CO 80906
Telephone:		719-391-4564
Facsimile:		719-391-4565
Ticker Symbol:       OTCBB - MYRG
Shares Outstanding:		6,630,004
Estimated Float:		1,220,004
52 Week Range:	      $2.27 - $0.03

Company Contact:	Mr. Ethan D. Hokit, President
------------------------------------------------------------
-



Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB-MYRG) recently became a
"new" publicly-owned company as a result of its
acquisition in December 2001 by Bactrol Technologies, Inc.
 MYRG markets and distributes groceries and related
products to commissaries on U.S. military bases in the
Colorado area, where our operating roots go back five
decades.  Previously a publicly-traded corporate shell,
Bactrol Technologies acquired Military Resale Group in a
reverse acquisition, leaving 6.6 million shares
outstanding and only 1.2 million shares in the public float.

MYRG was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired Pittock
Distributors, Inc., a fifty-year old firm specializing in
distribution of products to the Military Resale Market.
At the time of the acquisition of Pittock, it had
approximately $750,000 in revenue.  Revenue has increased
over five-fold (5x) in the past four years reaching $4.8
million in 2001.  MYRG believes that revenue can increase
to a $12 million annualized rate by the end of 2002 with
the existing facilities.  President Ethan Hokit and GM Bob
Hefner have each been in the local military resale market
for over 25 years.

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense (DOD) agency. The DOD's objective,
in this activity, is to operate resale store systems that
sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise
(at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices.
The resulting average cost savings last year of 30.4% make
the system a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military
personnel. The competitive structure of the Military
Resale Market consists of a few large distributors that do
not dominate the industry, and hundreds of smaller
distributors. MYRG's long-term strategy is to grow,
primarily by acquiring other small distributors, and also
by internal growth.

Positive Investment Theme

1. The Military Resale Market for groceries-merchandise is
a $15 billion a year niche industry.
-13,000,000 authorized patrons benefit from lower prices
(about 30%) and on-post shopping convenience.
-Demand is cyclically stable due to the basic product
nature and military headcount.
-Distributors require some specialized knowledge - a
barrier to entry - in this industry regulated by DeCA
(Defense Commissary Agency).

2. The shares possess several appealing investment features.
A.	They are statistically attractive, as measured by the
Market Value/Sales Ratio.
-MYRG's market value is currently about $2.0 million.
This is only .4x actual 2001 sales of $4.8 million and
only .3x projected 2002 sales of about $6.5 million, which
is well below the level of the Market Value/Sales ratio
for most stocks.
B.	The float is thin, containing only 1.2 million shares.
C.	A stock play on the Military Resale Market is a "new"
idea to investors and is defensive in a weaker economic
setting.

MYRG has set a target of reaching a trading range of $4.00
- $5.00 per share by year-end 2002 so that it can seek a
national exchange listing.

, RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gary on injur=
ed reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This offi=
cially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop hi=
m from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11=
/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half =
of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not thro=
w a touchdo! wn! pass for the first time this season, however, and has been=
 very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to s=
truggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12. =
 Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear wh=
o will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Bat=
ch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. =
Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go,=
 but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears sec=
ondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter , Q=
B DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carte=
r will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's ga=
me against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dall=
as, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't r=
ecommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Feeleys =
Fanatics Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesot=
a with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroi=
t. Keep an eye on h! is! progress during practice this week before you make=
 a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/2=
6/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring =
problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against S=
an Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him fo=
r Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/26/01 Graham suff=
ered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day=
 to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/26/01 Brookins =
may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate =
Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as =
a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dis=
located his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not been det=
ermined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE -! D! amons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 =
Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day=
 to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is l=
isted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was take=
n for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's =
Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for =
80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play i=
n recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as op=
ponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes =
Demons Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 Chargers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 =
yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-sta=
rt player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrat=
ed receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11=
/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also l=
ost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy st=
arter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25=
/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't de=
pend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barb=

ore consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day a=
gainst Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, in=
cluding 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - P=
owers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 ya=
rds and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting w=
hen the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yard=
s and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is =
only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Power=
s Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching si=
x passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against Sa! n ! Diego. He's one of t=
he most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on =
a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01=
 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 7=
8 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver=
, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Mo=
nkeys Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheat=
ley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more o=
ften in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of sta=
rting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully health=
y, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antow=
ain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of to=
tal offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smi=
th has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brad=
y , QB NE - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers again=
st New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become =
a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew=
 Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - C=
hargers Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no inter=
ceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continu=
ed to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , =
WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San=
 Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay J=
enkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Up=
dated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six =
pa! ss! es for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, =
and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointm=
ent for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing =
of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright =

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

is workload may be lessened a bit after Mike Alstott's performance against =
Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/29/01 Davis w=
as inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed he felt healthy enough t=
o play. According to the Denver Post, there is no clear indication of when =
the Broncos will use Davis again. "He never practiced last week with the fi=
rst team," Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did not play on Sunday. As of n=
ow, it is not clear who will start for the Cowboys at New York. Clint Stoer=
ner may have played well enough to get the call again next week.  Jim Mille=
r , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller (hip) will be further evalu=
ated on Monday. According to some published reports, he should be available=
 for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/29/=
01 Johnson injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The injury=
 is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and shoulder=
.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suf=
fered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to=
 day.  James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/29/01 Stewart wa=
s inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at =
RB for the Lions.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28=
/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the M=
innesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test M=
onday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in pra=
ctice last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," John=
son said. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll kn=
ow more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I =
was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/0=
1 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after t=
he Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a l=
ittle bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew=
 what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.=
"   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he=
 expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Sm=
ith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith =
was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose =
in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game act=
ion.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison ru=
shed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. T=
he veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief =
period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10=
/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots=
. He did score on an eight-y! ar! d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary c=
arry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some =
confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats =
Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver.=
 He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New=
 England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10=
/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also ca=
rried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threa=
t against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Con=
way , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120=
 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he=
 is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally pe=
rforming up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - =
Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play a=
gainst the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches =
was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on sh=
ort TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end=
 when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Comm=
issioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on f=
our catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield =
to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Cent=
ers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Pri=
ce caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is =
still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy=
 teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/0=
1 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs an=
d no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key p=
asses and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander ,=
 RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander =
to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, A=
lexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The=
 Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's be=
tter defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Ju=
gg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Se=
attle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more=
 than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28=
/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also=
 lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally=
 productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held=
 to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up cons=
istently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right no=
w.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nin=
e passes for 109 yards and ! a ! TD against Washington. He remains a must-s=
tart Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB =
WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the =
Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for goo=
d yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are ab=
le to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 B=
anks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Ri=
ght, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy rese=
rve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley playe=
d Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three =
carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Rai=
ders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, =
it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, =
which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That mak=
es both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10=
/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philad=
elphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured =
back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyr=

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

  [IMAGE] December 23, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 109 [IMAGE] =
    Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC=
 Journal Members:      [IMAGE] "Twas the night before Christmas...."    [IM=
AGE]  In December of 1822 a poem was written by a literature professor at C=
olumbia College (now University) to amuse his children.   The poem was orig=
inally entitled "A Visit From St. Nicholas". One year later it was publishe=
d anonymously in the Troy Sentinel, submitted without the author's knowledg=
e by a house guest who obtained a copy.   A New York publisher later issued=
 the poem, and was advised nearly universally by critics of the time that i=
t was a waste of paper and ink.   However, as usual the critics were wrong.=
 This unheralded verse managed to hang on, and after the author's death it =
was illustrated with drawings from Thomas Nast and became very famous.   Th=
e author was Clement Clarke Moore, and the poem began with the phrase "Twas=
 the night before Christmas...."   So much for the critics. Have a wonderfu=
l Christmas. Remember, the gifts that are around you are more precious than=
 the gifts you unwrap.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Anno=
unces Year End Results- Santa in Nowhere to be Found [IMAGE]    Over the Lo=
ng Term Market Price Action Always Tells You What's Happening Even When the=
 Company Doesn't, and the Market is Rarely Wrong.  The Editors of the OTC J=
ournal  [IMAGE]  Envoy Communications held a conference call this past week=
 to discuss its fiscal year end results (end of September). Santa was nowhe=
re to be found. Based on what we learned from the call the stock has droppe=
d from the mid $4 range to just under $1 in the past year because it deserv=
ed to.   The company revealed an abdominal 4th quarter where they lost $2.2=
 million EBITDA. Although they ended the year with just over $80 million in=
 revenues (up 38%) and about $7 million in EBITDA profits (down 30%), the t=
rend towards losses is very disturbing.   We have been in a tough market en=
vironment for many companies, and Envoy has not been left out. Of the $2.2 =
million the company lost in the 4th quarter, $.5 million is attributed to s=
hutting down the Communiqu? division, and $1 million was attributed to Sage=
 Consulting, their technology division which will probably continue to lose=
 money.   The only bright spot was the performance of Watt Group, their Int=
ernational design and consulting firm. Watt is profitable and now represent=
s 50% of the company's ongoing revenue stream.   As seen in the chart, the =
recent rebound in the stock has dramatically reversed course as a result of=
 this disclosure. In our last edition on Envoy we felt the stock was destin=
ed for higher levels. In the short term, this past week's financial disclos=
ure sabotaged our prediction. Sadly, we were wrong. It's not the first time=
 and it won't be the last.   However, these financial results are a snapsho=
t of the past. We are concerned with the future. In the conference call the=
 company indicated they expected to make $8.6 million in EBITDA profits nex=
t year.   December quarterly numbers are expected to be lackluster, and the=
y are expecting improvements in the March and June quarters.   The editors =
of the OTC Journal are very disappointed that management never gave any ong=
oing public disclosure concerning their 4th quarter performance. Many compa=
nies are falling on hard times, but most of them are choosing to inform the=
 public as disappointments occur.   It is evident from the performance of t=
he stock that someone knew the company was doing so poorly. Unfortunately, =
it wasn't us.   We still believe the stock will rebound to the $2 level, al=
though it may take some time. Recent new contract wins have resulted in sur=
ges in the stock price, suggesting the market wants to believe again.   In =
the next week the stock may suffer from the final week of potential tax sel=
ling. If you see the stock down near $1 it should be bought for a January r=
ebound.   Still to come: Year end wrap ups on XMLG (big stuff happening the=

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
2001/2002 Winter Assessment is shown below.  A copy is also available on
the following NERC web site:

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  "Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season," says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  "Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions."

"Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably," he added, "although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter."  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

  Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC J=
ournal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement     When I look back on a=
ll these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathb=
ed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which never happen=
ed. Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour  We are working on a very =
special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters. The last three weeks h=
ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid=
es straight down.   There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1=
% of their previous highs. Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m=
inimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will =
review the rule early next year.   Unlike most market environments, individ=
ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a=
t these levels. Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not=
 allowed to hold stocks. Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others=
 have a $1 threshold. Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes=
e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes agains=
t their personal wishes and their own common sense. Fund managers will be a=
ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above $1 and $5.   =
We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove=
rsold. In order to make the list, the stock must be trading below the cash =
value the company has per share, and have little or no debt. We will try to=
 publish this exciting edition next weekend. We might call it the "Riskless=
 Rebound" edition. Stayed tuned.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems (OTC BB: =
EYPSF) Updated Profile [IMAGE]  Followers of Energy Power know it has been =
trading up and down the charts over the last 2 weeks. We are suggesting the=
 company change its symbol to OTIS as the stock goes up and down like an Ot=
is Elevator.   For investors looking for more information on Energy Power, =
the editors of the OTC Journal have updated our original profile to reflect=
 changing corporate events subsequent to the original release on February 1=
2th.   Click Here  to review the updated profile. If you never read our ori=
ginal release this would be an excellent opportunity to familiarize yoursel=
f with this company.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Update=
 [IMAGE]  Our inbox is filled with questions on Envoy as the stocks fades i=
nto the oblivion of the $1 range. The stock is behaving as if there is some=
thing wrong with the company.   We spoke with management briefly this week =
about this issue. At the corporate level nothing has changed. Fiscal 2001, =
which ended at the end of September, still looks like roughly $10 million C=
DN in EBITDA profits. As of right now, business for fiscal 2002 looks about=
 the same as 2001. The stock is trading at about 3 times 2002 EBITDA. The i=
ndustry average is currently 11 times 2002 EBITDA.   What's the explanation=
 for this pathetic performance? Simple- management is doing nothing at this=
 time to market their company to investors. Their only audience is the memb=
ers of the OTC Journal.   A plan for a nationwide institutional road show w=
as in place prior to Attack on America, but that is now on hold. We can onl=
y hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareh=
olders and get proactive in telling their story.    Tax selling could hurt =
this stock, so it could go lower. One can only hope that despite management=
's failure to get out and tell their story, someone will come along and rec=
ognize the inherent value in this company.   Bottom line- Not worth selling=
 at this price, but it could go lower.     [IMAGE] Attention Football Fans =

 Jurevicius , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/19/01 Jurevicius (hamstring=
) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep=
 ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary.   Travis Henry , RB BUF=
 - Kens Killers Updated 12/19/01 Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprai=
ned right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.   Tim Dwight  , WR SD=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to pl=
ay this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.  Tyrone=
 Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Wheatley, who was not us=
ed last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will prob=
ably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams.   Derrick Mas=
on , WR TEN - Kens Killers Updated 12/19/01 Mason missed Tuesday's practice=
 with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.  Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/19/01 McNair (back stiffness) missed=
 practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day.   Chris Sanders , W=
R TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Sanders has returned to practice from a=
 back injury. He is not expected to play this week.   Tony Richardson , RB =
KC - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Richardson is day to day with a shoulder i=
njury. He is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg o=
r Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained h=
amstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.  Bill Gramatica , K ARI - Car=
sons Wildcats Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reser=
ve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three=
 games of the season.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01=
 Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  H=
e might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gain=
ed 73 yards Sunday.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/=
01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week=
. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday ag=
ainst Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin=
 injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back =
and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playi=
ng in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health sta=
tus makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start =
for Bettis.  Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Titans Head =
Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over th=
e final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . =
"We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if=
 at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to =
get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's prod=
uction over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.  Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/18/01 McNair will miss Tuesday's pra=
ctice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's=
 game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to rep=
air a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday=
. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for=
 Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zereoue re-i=
njured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His s=
tatus for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a ma=
rginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/18/01 The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured rese=
rve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese w=
ill probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson se=
rving as his backup.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 12/1=
8/01 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remain=
der of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly star=
ter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel W=
hite, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of =
the way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated =
12/18/01 Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for=
 this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. D=
on't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based=
 on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent =
Updated 12/18/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due =
to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand.=
 Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be w=
orth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.  Akili Smi=
th  , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Smith on inju=
red reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. =
He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring t=
o the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the seas=
on if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the r=
est of the year anyway.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01=
 The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnat=
i after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 car=
ries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three afte=
r he recovered from a hand inj! ur! y. None of the three is a worthy starte=
r in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.   Doug Flutie , QB S=
D - Powers Rangers Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Mon=
day that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of roo=
kie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playin=
g time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player=
 during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he cou=
ld sit in favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibl=
y Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for=
 Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his stat=
us before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free A=
gent Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup t=
his week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine=
 his true status for the game.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Feeleys Fanatics U=
pdated 12/18/01 Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed =
as questionable for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past fe=
w weeks.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 12/18/01 Davis suf=
fered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. "He's sore today,=
 but he has indicated he'll be fine," Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the W=
ashington Post. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to start against Chic=
ago in Week 15.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Accordi=
ng to the Washington Post, Banks will remain the Redskins' starting quarter=
back. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach Marty Schottemhe=
imer is expected to stick with him rather than go with backup Kent Graham. =
  Frank Murphy , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Murphy suffered a seve=
rely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago. The injury will likely=
 keep him out of this weekend's game against New Orleans.   More Updates  T=
eams, Player News  [IMAGE]Carsons Wildcats Player News  Bill Gramatica , Re=
serve K Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Ro=
okie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games=
 of the season.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Green had an awf=
ul outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 recei=
ving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance.   L=
aDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-p=
urpose yards on Saturday against Oakland. He seems to be wearing down somew=
hat, which makes him more and more of a risk for Fantasy owners.   Kurt War=
ner , Active QB Updated 12/14/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to =
success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival =
Saints on Monday Night Football.   Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 =
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularl=
y featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football.   David Patten =
, Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Patten hasn't been a very good Fantasy receive=
r recently. His numbers may suffer now that Terry Glenn has returned.   Fre=
ddie Jones , Reserve TE Updated 12/14/01 Jones has been a Fantasy disappoin=
tment again this year. He won't do much against Oakland on Saturday.  Rod G=
ardner , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy p=
layer this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the to=
ugh Philadelphia secondary this week.   Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 1=
2/13/01 Brunell did not practice Wednesday but will play Sunday, according =
to the Florida Times-Union. He is expected to practice on Thursday. Brunell=
 is recovering from a lingering quadriceps injury and an injured finger.  S=
hannon Sharpe , Reserve TE Updated 12/13/01 Sharpe is recovering from a leg=
 injury but is expected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is liste=
d as probable on the injury report.   Steve Christie , Active K Updated 12/=
12/01 Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Riche=
y, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.  Michael P=
ittman , Reserve RB Updated 12/02/01 Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 a=
ll-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as=
 a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.  Tr=
avis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to the Viki=
ngs, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a =
Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 Head Co=
ach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Arc=
huleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (ha=
mstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final =
preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener again=
st Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round sele=
ction on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensive back=
 Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on Sa=
turday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is uncerta=

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Alright, dammit...
 
I forkin told everyone that it was first come,  first served.
The ONLY reason that you should copy everyone via  email
is out of  courtesy so they know the player is off the free agent
list until I make the actual trade because,  A.) I can't do the
deal until Tuesday morning anyway, and B.) it makes  other
team members aware of the trade.
 
Protocol, people.

In case you guys didn't receive anything from the house, Pig is on April 13
this year. They must have gotten around to scheduling it late though, because
the actual dinner is at the Holiday Inn rather than the Ramada. However,
there's a block of rooms reserved at both hotels. If you tell the Ramada you
need a room reserved by the house you can get it for $68 per night, which is
almost $20 less than their normal rip-off rate... or you're more than welcome
to crash in my room and sleep next to Kalberg. (I'd go with your own room)

Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herma=

 XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight=
 weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR =

the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's p=

 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning J=

inst Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some=
 things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," sai=

playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=
st the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=

actice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=
 it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head c=
oach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's =
game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     R=
aghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering f=
rom a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as=
 probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach=
 Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon=
 as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that=
 bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn=
't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hu=
rt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that=
 when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it wo=
uld be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe i=
f Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilf=
er  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice =
on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Ha=
sselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Ha=
sselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the S=
eahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to=
 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in fo=
r Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very fav=
orable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him =
this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01   =
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caro=
lina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concuss=
ion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. =
He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy=
 player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Drunk Monke=
ys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury.=
 He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use =
him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01 =
  Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead =
of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend=
 you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hard=
ly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  =
  Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might mi=
ss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right =
foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Commissioner=
 Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas C=
ity due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league =
this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Dav=
is is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback gam=
e from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether =
they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos =
hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you us=

serve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured rese=
rve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his =
season.    Rob Moore  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  According to Cardinals=
 coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.=
 Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have set=
backs in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the=
 Arizona Republic . "That's why we both handled it like we did in training =
camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't=
 tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, =
we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the ti=
me to let him go.    Freddie Jones  , Active TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones spr=
ained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Michae=
l Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.    LaDainian Tomlinson  , Active R=
B Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this sea=
son by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on th=
e day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.    Ahma=
n Green  , Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01  Green will get the bulk of his numb=
ers in the second half if Green Bay can get ahead of Minnesota early. He wi=
ll definitely be good for at least one TD.    Shannon Sharpe  , Active TE U=
pdated 10/19/01  Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight =
ends are concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a =
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores =
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches =
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season.    Kurt Warner  , Active QB Upda=
ted 10/18/01  Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis=
, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against =
the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.    Torry Ho=

s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi=

er 200 yards and a score.    Vikings  , Reserve DT Updated 09/26/01  The Vi=
kings signed former Buffalo safety Henry Jones this week. He'll replace Rob=
ert Griffith, who broke his leg during Sunday's game against Chicago. The m=
ove won't make Minnesota's secondary much better than it was, however, and =
doesn't improve the unit overall from a Fantasy perspective.    Steve Chris=
tie  , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01  According to published reports, Christie=
 has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injure=
d reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Dro=
p Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake=
 Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.    Travis P=
rentice  , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01  Prentice was traded to the Vikings,=
 where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fant=
asy draft choice right now.    Rams  , Active DT Updated 08/30/01  Head Coa=
ch Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Arch=
uleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (ham=
string) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final p=
reseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener agains=
t Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selec=
tion on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover need=
s just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to br=
eak the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to g=
et plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in y=
our active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner=

---------------------------------------------
 
Some excitement last Saturday - The men's team beat 9th ranked  Oklahoma State!  WOW! Watch out Jayhawks!
 
Larry Reid scored 13 of his game-high 18
points in the second half as  Kansas State upset ninth-ranked Oklahoma
State, 70-61, in a Big 12 Conference  men's basketball game Saturday
at Bramlage  Coliseum.
        The victory was the  Wildcats' second straight over a team
that opened the week among the leaders  in the Big 12. Kansas State,
which beat Texas on Wednesday, improved to 9-10  overall and 3-5 in
the league.
----------------------------------------------
 
A little disappointment for the ladies team - an upset by Iowa State
 
Lindsey Wilson scored 25 points, Tracy
Gahan added 21 and Angie Welle  had 20 points as 16th-ranked Iowa
State upset No. 9 Kansas State, 86-72, in a  Big 12 Conference women's
basketball game played Saturday before a sellout  crowd of 13,340.
        The victory  lifted the Cyclones to 17-5 overall and 5-5 in
the Big 12. Kansas State had a  three-game winning streak snapped and
fell to 20-3 and 8-2 in the league. The  Wildcats also had an 11-game
home winning streak stopped.
 
---------------------
 
See you tonight.
 
GO CATS!

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Friends,
Just a brief word,
Please read Matthew 27:39-44. This is part  of a Lenten  study that I will be doing between now and Easter.  J. Ellsworth Kalas has  written many books the reflect today's theological thinking. The book for Lent  is Seven Words to the Cross. The first word is "Scorn." We will look at this  first word and then in March we will look at another one of the seven. I really  hope all of you can be here.

Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/13/01 According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to re=
turn from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed t=
o reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so =
well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which =
one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're =
betting it will be Alexander.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated=
 11/13/01 Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a spra=
ined right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't =
go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole=
, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is al=
ready expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.  Edd=
ie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Kennison returned to=
 the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to=
 the Denver Post . While this is a radical turnaround from his message of r=
etirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a =
result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be pl=
aced on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either =
way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the rema=
inder of the season. Drop him.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/13/01 According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for=
 Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't hea=
led sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majori=
ty of the playing time in his absence.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/13/01 Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against =
Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as=
 probable for Sunday's game.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Upda=
ted 11/13/01 Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a s=
houlder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver.   Fred T=
aylor , RB JAC - Feeleys Fanatics  Updated 11/13/01 Taylor is expected to p=
lay Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month becau=
se of a groin injury.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 =
Jones re-injured his shoulder in Sunday's game. He had an MRI done on the s=
houlder Monday. His status for this week's game is uncertain.   Mark Brunel=
l , QB JAC - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Brunell is expected to play =
this week, despite suffering from a sore leg. However, he is not expected t=
o ! pr! actice. Nevertheless, look for Brunell to be a productive No. 1 QB =
this week.   Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Johnson mi=
ght play on a limited basis in Sunday's game against Tennessee. He will be =
re-evalauted on Tuesday, according to The Cincinnati Post. Johnson has been=
 sidelined for a month because of a fractured collarbone.  Terry Glenn , WR=
 NE - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Glenn should be able to play Sunday if he=
 practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald . He has=
 not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patri=
ots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Brian Natkin , TE T=
EN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Natkin started Monday's game. He was used =
to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entir=
e game but had only one catch for 18 yards.    Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/13/01 Wycheck left Monday's game briefly because of an a=
nkle injury but returned. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Wycheck ha=
d two catc! h! es for 18 yards Monday.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fana=
tics Updated 11/13/01 Garcia made it through another game using a brace to =
protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve=
 Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace =
soon.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Kelly suffered =
both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over Dallas. He will have =
an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for =
this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time.   Elvis Grba=
c , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Grbac started in Monday's game des=
pite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchd=
own, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have ove=
rcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week.   Kurt Warner =
, QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Warner admitted to STLtoday.co=
m that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelp=
hia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun ext=
ensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though =
his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. "I don't anticipate this being =
a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured," Martz said. "He ha=
s played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine."   Terr=
y Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/13/01 Allen played in Monday's gam=
e against Tennessee but suffered a fractured left hand in his first and onl=
y carry of the game, during the second quarter. His status for Sunday's gam=
e is uncertain. !   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Dyso=
n played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears h=
e has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touc=
hdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains he=
althy.   Panthers , DT CAR - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Defensive end =
Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II =
sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (a=
nkle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely! r! eturn to act=
ion this weekend against San Francisco.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/13/01 Weinke (shoulder), who missed Sunday's 48-14 loss to St.=
 Louis, has been cleared to practice. His status for this weekend's game ag=
ainst San Francisco is still unclear, however, but coach George Seifert exp=
ects him to play.   Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Commissioner Updated 11/13/01=
 According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's g=
ame against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandle=
r missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chand=
ler will be available for the game.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts=
 Updated 11/12/01 Davis has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and wi=
ll be out 10 to 12 days, Mike Shanahan said. He will undergo surgery, and i=
s not expected to play in the next two games. Mike Anderson will start in h=
is place.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01! Schroede=
r may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday=
. His current status is day to day.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/12/01 Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this w=
eek, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis.  Patriot=
s coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bl=
edsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, wh=
o is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarter=
back.    Kurt Warner  , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/12/01 Warner s=
ays his thumb is affecting the way he throws the ball. X-rays revealed a sp=
rained ligament, and he will be limited in practice this week.  Rob Johnson=
 , QB BUF - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/12/01 According to published reports,=
 Johnson will miss at least four weeks with a broken clavicle. Alex Van Pel=
t will start while he is out.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated=
 11/12/01 Moss felt soreness in his ankle on Sunda! y,! but he is fine and =
there is no apparent reason to expect him to miss any playing time.  Tyrone=
 Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01 Wheatley did not play at=
 Seattle. His return date is still unclear.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carson=

- Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards a=
gainst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent w=
eeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents co=
ntinue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Upd=
ated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes f=
or 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fan=
! ta! sy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Charg=
ers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards.=
 Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start pla=
yer for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated rec=
eivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/25/01=
 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a =
fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter =
on most teams right now.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 =
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend=
 on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber ,=

against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well re=

sistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/2=
5/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against =
Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including=
 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers R=
angers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and=
 two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the=
 matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a=
 touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a =
reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Range=
rs Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passe=
s for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most rel=
iable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly ba=
sis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01 Jackson ha=
d a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and=
 a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is=
 worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yard=
s against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks=
 and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg =
or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried=
 the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in sho=
rt-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for a=
ny Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may n=
ot be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith ,=
 RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=
 and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=
me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 Powers Rangers Updat! ed! 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New O=
rleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty=
 reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe=
 on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers =
Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions=
 against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to lo=
ok like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego a=
fter re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, =
and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Updated 11=
/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes f=
or 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy =
owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most=
 of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year =
with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs a=
nd one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration a=
s long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA=
 - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards =
at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden =
is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final =
weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler thr=
ew for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performanc=
e may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too incon=
sistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Drunk Mon=
keys Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 r=
ushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to r=
ebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Powe=
rs Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caug! ht! four passes for 32 yards again=
st Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy tea=
ms as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Upda=
ted 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The ro=
okie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like=
 a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis=
 played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a g=
ood backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been =
known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Commissioner Updated=
 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. H=
e posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes=
 for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CA=
R - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against=
 Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game again=
st New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free =
Agent Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his retu=
rn from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to =
be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL -=
 Commissioner Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwi=
ng for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolin=
a with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy =
numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Alexande=

for Texans.     Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bu=
reau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings.  The company repor=

Why do all of you lazy f*cks fail to  follow
the directions below? What I am referring  to
is making a trade. The directions were as  follows:
 
1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction,  click on the "Owners" tab
on the league homepage (found up top next to Live  Chat), page down
to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to ALL team  members
announcing your  intentions. I will implement the trade(s) on the Tuesday  following
the Monday night game. The transaction deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the  weekend
games. If I receive the email  timestamped before then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday  night game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time  after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on
the amount of transactions, feel free to  contribute as much as you wish.
 
The next jackass that submits for a  trade transaction and does NOT braodcast
it to everybody in the league will  be ignored. Gill and Farley, take note.

What a cute baby squirrel!  How old is the little man?  Does he walk yet? I
 'm in Kansas right now...working for my Dad for a couple of weeks(and deer hunting), and am headed up to Manhattan tomorrow night......

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!
haha

How's everything else treating you?  I am headed back to Vail around the 5th of Nov., to drive snowcats for the winter....
actually that's my night job....and the job that gets me my insurance and ski pass....I am getting a few photography deals going, so I will be doing that during the daylight hours(oh yeah...and skiing alot!!hehehe).

I actually check my codydownard@hotmail.com account more than this one, so start using that one por favor..

Let me know how everything is going!!

Perge!

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

>WILDCATS NAME BIELEMA AS LINEBACKERS COACH
>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Bret Bielema, formerly the linebackers
>coach at Iowa, has been hired as the linebackers coach and
>co-defensive coordinator at Kansas State, head football coach Bill
>Snyder announced Thursday.
>        Bielema, who turns 32 on Jan. 13, was on the Hawkeyes'
>coaching staff for eight years, including the last six as the
>linebackers coach. A former Hawkeye co-captain, he lettered at four
>years for Iowa and started for two seasons as a defensive lineman.
>        "There are a lot of close ties and with the Iowa connection,
>I've been familiar with the program," said Bielema. "To come to
>Kansas State and be a co-coordinator is a great opportunity. I spent
>time there with Coach Snyder and saw everything they have in place.
>I'm excited to get in there and hit the ground running."
>        Bielema and Sean Snyder, K-State's Associate A.D. for
>football operations, were teammates at Iowa in 1988.
>        "Bret brings a wealth of talent and enthusiasm to our
>program," said Snyder. "He has proven to be a very successful
>recruiter, a players' coach and a tireless worker.
>        "It was not easy for Bret to leave the University of Iowa,
>where he has spent his entire career as a player and coach. I am
>grateful to (head coach) Kirk Ferentz, a dear friend, and the
>University of Iowa, also a dear friend, for allowing us the
>opportunity to approach Bret."
>        Bielema became a member of the Iowa staff as a volunteer
>student assistant in 1993. He worked with the Hawkeye defense and
>special teams as a graduate assistant for two seasons before moving
>into a full-time coaching position.
>        As a player, Bielema joined the Iowa football program as a
>walk-on and quickly became a factor. He was a member of Iowa's Big
>Ten championship team in 1990 and took part in the 1991 Rose Bowl.
>Bielema was a starter as a junior in 1991 when the Hawkeyes were
>10-1-1, ranked fifth in the final CNN/USA Today poll and played in
>the 1991 Holiday Bowl.
>        He was elected one of two co-captains in 1992 and finished
>his Hawkeye career with 83 tackles.
>        Bielema signed a free-agent contract with the Seattle
>Seahawks as a defensive lineman in April 1993, before completing his
>football career with the Milwaukee Mustangs of the Arena Football
>League in 1994.
>        Bielema earned his bachelor's degree in marketing from Iowa in

layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According =
to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Wat=
ters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which coul=
d be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"=
 Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into th=
e lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has co=
me in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll =
play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash =
both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=
 from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injur=
y. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on =
any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for S=
unday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He=
 replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined wit=
h a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck f! ro!=
 m a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR N=
YJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as quest=
ionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday =
to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Ra=
ms.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday'=
s practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Se=
attle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lama=
r Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Mo=
nday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle=
, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys =
Wonders Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Mi=
nnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapo=
lis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the C=
olts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-c=
ut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/=
01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to=
 a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND=
 - Commissioner Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's gam=
e at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fa=
ntasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/2=
3/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his come=
back game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided =
whether they will act! iv! ate him. He will work in practice this week and =
the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't reco=
mmend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's=
 Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn =
, RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg =
Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Du=
nn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to pl=
ay on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics U=
pdated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but h=
e didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, =
and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 3=
4 yar! ds! on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to dep=
end on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him=
 if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Kens=
 Killers Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game bu=
t is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf in=
jury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , =
WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb inju=
ry but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is exp=
ected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Up=
dated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expec=
ted to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics=
 Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a pl=
ay in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  =
 Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean repor=
ts that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is exp=
ected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an =
injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Dr=
ew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI =
on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Ta=
ylor , RB JAC - Feeleys ! Fa! natics Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled=
 out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game=
 remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase h=
is exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Flo=
rida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Pr=
ogress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make som=
e kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has bee=
n inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcu=
tt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game beca=
use of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to actio=
n next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did no=
t play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is opt=
imistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inacti=
ve for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB =
BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of S=
unday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. J=
ason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grba=
c , QB BAL - Powers R! an! gers Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expect=
s Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarter=
back wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest =
area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the carti=
lage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wa=
it and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.=
     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffe=
red a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. Howev=
er, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orle=
ans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According=
 to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of =
Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshal=
l to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 perce=
nt before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's =
not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement=
 last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspe=
ctive again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0=
1 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is clo=
se to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It =
was a blessing for me because I w! as! able to get treatment every day," St=
okes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say =
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, ho=
wever, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be=
 more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Chargers Updated 10/23/01 Hilliar=
d continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting l=
ineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night=
 against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is=
 almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/=
01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to =
a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB =
STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, =
Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taki=
ng the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expec=
t Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent befo=
re I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would =
once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    More Updates  =

>>76-63 victory over No. 12 Texas Tech in a Big 12 Conference women's
>>basketball game played Sunday before a sellout crowd of 13,340 at
>>Bramlage Coliseum.
>>        The victory improved the Wildcats to 19-2 overall and 7-1 in

>>season. The Lady Raiders fell to 12-6 overall and 4-4 in the Big 12
>>and had a three-game winning streak snapped that included wins over a
>>pair of ranked teams.
>>        Kansas State, which hit 18 of 22 shots (82 percent) from the
>>floor in the second half, put four players in double figures. Kristin
>>Rethman had 15 points, including a 4-for-5 effort from three-point
>>range, while Laurie Koehn had 13 points and Megan Mahoney added 11.
>>        Jia Perkins finished with 24 points for Tech, scoring 18 in
>>the first half. She went 1-for-8 in the second half after hitting 8
>>of her 12 shots before halftime. Casey Jackson added 11 points and 10
>>rebounds for the Lady Raiders.
>>        The game was tied at 41-41 with 15:20 remaining when the
>>Wildcats grabbed the lead for good on a bucket by Ohlde, who had 17
>>points on 8-for-8 shooting from the floor in the second half.
>>        K-State led 55-51 with 8:45 to play when back-to-back layups
>>by Mahoney gave the 'Cats an eight-point lead. The Raiders were
>>within 65-59 with 4:25 left when the Wildcats made their decisive
>>run. Shalondra Booker hit a three-pointer, Mahoney added a layup and
>>Ohlde scored on a three-point play to put K-State ahead 74-59 with
>>1:34 to play.
>>        Texas Tech held a 35-32 edge on the boards, but second-half
>>shooting was the difference in the game. While the Wildcats were hot
>>from the field after halftime, Tech managed just 27 percent shooting
>>from the floor, hitting just 9 of 34 shots.
>>        Rethman finished with five assists for Kansas State, while
>>Candi White had six and Perkins added five assists and five steals.
>>        Kansas State travels to 13th-ranked Texas on Wednesday before
>>returning home on Saturday, Feb. 2 to play No. 14 Iowa State. The
>>game against the Cyclones is also a sellout.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

PORN GOES PUBLIC

With sharp economic ups and downs, it is surprising that any company would dare go public now. That is unless you happen to contain the only two money making Internet business models. Jade Entertainment Group (proposed symbol, NASDAQ OTCBB: JENT), announced it's self directed IPO of 500,000 shares of common stock at $3.00 per share recently, and expects to be publicly traded within 60 days.

So why risk an IPO now? Simple. JENT's main web property www.askjade.com merges the much acclaimed pay-per-click search engine model (goto.com and Findwhat.com:FWHT) and the ever-profitable Adult Entertainment Industry (Private: PRVT  and New Frontier Media: NOOF). Askjade.com is a mega adult search engine that allows owners of adult sites to bid on how much they will pay for a click-through to their site. This bid determines the placement within the engine. The higher the bid for particular keywords, the higher the bidder appears in the search results.

With plans to expand into content distribution, and over 300 webmasters already signed up and funding accounts, The company shows great promise of generating major revenues by years end. Already generating enough revenue to cover technical overhead, the company projects short term revenue in the millions. "Going public allows us to quickly generate funds for marketing that will get us where we want to be sooner rather than later", states President Tim Schmidt, "Usually only webmasters and owners of adult sites get rich off of the industry, we are giving the investor a chance to take advantage.

A two-year study by Alexa Research has revealed, Sex-related terms remain quite popular among Internet searches. "Sex" was the most popular term for which people searched. Of all the terms searched for online, 0.3289% -- or roughly 1 of every 300 terms -- were "sex." People search for "sex" more often than "games," "music," "travel," "jokes," "cars," "jobs," "weather" and "health" combined. "Porn" (along with "porno" and "pornography") was the fourth most popular search term. "Nude" (and "nudes"), "xxx," "Playboy" and "erotic stories" (and "erotica") were also among the top 20.

$0.0012 (12 hundredths of one cent) 52-Week High $0.56 52-Week Low $0.0011 =
  Company Background  Today we have a look at a classic merge and conquer s=
cenario in the $200 billion dollar Direct Response sector.  The conqueror-t=
o-be is called BMII (Blagman Media International, Inc.) The new company wil=
l combine the talents and clients of some of the biggest names in the infom=
ercial world under the Blagman name.  With its announced plans to acquire m=
ajor companies such as Century Media Inc. and Wellworld Group Ltd., BMII ha=
s quickly established a gateway for major immediate revenue stream coupled =
with rapid internal growth.  A-List clients have included the likes of Proc=
tor & Gamble, Kodak, Dainler-Chrysler, Black and Decker, Home Shopping Netw=
ork, and TriStar.  Total combined billings for BMII upon the completion of =
its acquisitions are expected to run from $80 to $100 million dollars in 20=
02.  This will give BMII the financial leverage and the know-how to change =
the face of the Direct Response industry.  Industry Stats  According to the=
 Direct Marketing Association (DMA), U.S. direct marketing expenditures , c=
urrently at $191.6 billion, are expected to continue to grow annually at 7.=
1% from 2002 until 2005.  Moreover, U.S. sales revenue due to direct market=
ing is estimated to reach more than $1.8 trillion for 2001. Through 2005, s=
uch sales are estimated to grow by 9.6% annually to reach $2.7 trillion.   =
Again- Direct Response will cause $2.7 trillion (estimated) in sales by 200=
5.  This figure goes to show the effectiveness of direct marketing as well =
as the likelihood that demand for Direct Response will continue to grow ove=
r the years.    BMII's Growth Strategy  Recognizing the opportunity for str=
ategic consolidation in the Direct Response industry, the management of Cen=
tury Media and Blagman decided to utilize BMII to facilitate the acquisitio=
n strategy.  Through its public position, BMII assumed the lead role in the=
 financing and negotiated the acquisition for a combination of stock and ca=
sh.  The company's senior management and board will consist of a combinatio=
n of senior managers from both companies.  Currently, no other direct indep=
endent competitor to BMII is in the field of Direct Response having the bre=
adth and depth of its combined enterprises.  At present, 99% of the pure pl=
ay infomercial business is privately held.  And for good reason.  The margi=
ns offered by Direct Response sales are three and four times greater than t=
raditional bricks-and-mortar retail. Profit potential that makes BMII a sto=
ck with tremendous upside.    BMII CEO Robert Blagman understands the Infom=
ercial sector.  Says Blagman,  "The primary purpose of these reverse merger=
s was to make BMII public and create a new BMII, a vehicle with which to bu=
ild a media-buying infrastructure.  BMII will streamline operations, combin=
e miscellaneous expenses, and create synergies within this larger structure=
 to increase economies of scale and lower costs-per-eyeball for their clien=
ts."  In Conclusion  Given its accomplishments and current plans, BMII appe=
ars to have great upside potential in the exciting infomercial market.  Bla=
gman Media International has demonstrated is ability to capture substantial=
 clients, as evidenced by its impressive client base.  The acquisitions of =
Century Media and Wellworld will provide BMII with an even larger client ba=
se with plenty of experience under its wing.     With an expected $80-100 m=
illion in billings for 2002 and the prospect of additional mergers, acquisi=
tions, and new ventures, BMII gives investors plenty to look at given its p=
rice of just fractions of a penny per share.=09

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Don't forget the Bowl Watch Party on Saturday, December 29, at 4 p.m. when

and for this wonderful country in which we live.  We pray that the year 2002
will not be so difficult for so many of our fellow Americans.  Follow the

>PASCO HAS 30 POINTS TO LEAD K-STATE TO VICTORY
>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Junior center Pervis Pasco had 30 points
>and 11 points to lead Kansas State to an 84-70 victory over North
>Texas in a men's college basketball game played Saturday at Bramlage
>Coliseum.
>        The win snapped a two-game losing streak by the Wildcats and
>lifted them to 5-3 overall. The Mean Green fell to 1-6 on the year
>after losing their sixth straight.
>        Pasco, who also had five blocked shots, hit 11 of 17 shots
>from the floor to lead the Wildcats. Nick Williams chipped in with 19
>points, while Larry Reid finished with 13 points, eight assists and
>seven rebounds.
>        Junior guard Chris Davis led North Texas with 28 points and
>nine rebounds, hitting 11 of 21 shots from the floor. He also had
>three three-pointers for the Mean Green, which got 10 points off the
>bench from Unjel Masters.
>        Kansas State went on an 11-1 run midway through the first
>half to take a 22-18 lead with 7:20 left. The lead grew through the
>rest of the half, and the Wildcats went to halftime with a 44-33
>halftime edge behind 15 points from Pasco.
>        K-State's advantage grew to 20 at 56-36 in the opening five
>minutes of the second half before the Mean Green started a slow
>comeback. North Texas cut the deficit under double figures to trail
>73-64 with 4:03 to play. But K-State hit 7 of its final 8 free throws
>in the final 3:50 to seal the win.
>        Pasco's previous season-high was 16 points, scored against
>Gardner-Webb. The double-double was his second of the season and his
>second straight, as he had 15 points and 10 boards at Northwestern
>last Saturday.
>        Williams also had a season-high for K-State, eclipsing the 15
>points he had scored at Northwestern.
>        K-State committed only eight turnovers in the game and
>finished with a 47 percent shooting mark from the field. North Texas
>was held to just 40 percent shooting from the floor.
>        Kansas State hosts Western Carolina on Wednesday evening at 7 p.m.

Hope you received the negatives --- we got some great
prints.

Found the name of a good Lab there for prints.

Houston Photo Imaging
5250 Gulfton St

Try the machine prints first -- 8x10 is $8.95 for
example

they also have a custom -- if you want anything
special-
for $15 an 8x10

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Weighing in at 8 lbs, 10oz, Jonathan Lawrence Vogel was born at 6:33 p.m. on
Sunday, November 18. Mother and baby are doing just fine. I think we're
planning to stay one more night at the hospital before going home, so little
Jonathan will have to wait until Tuesday to see his new home.

WEPCO is one of the two shorts we have @ CE.  I think WEPCO would be willing to sell us a piece to bookout the 50 we owe them @ COMED.  They might even look at selling for a term longer than daily.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Graduate Brothers, 
      Our new cabinet is in place and now functioning with some degree of competency.  If you need to get a hold of us for any reason the contact numbers are: 
            President: Kurt Niebuhr (785) 395-0996  x 237 
            Treasurer: Chris Jackson                      x 128 
            Recording: Joey Buckley                      x 202 
            Corresponding: Nick Seglie                   x 127 
       
      Over break the cabinet traveled to Internationals in Lexington for a cabinet retreat and represented well for Chi Deutron. 
      Our newly elected scholarship chair, Jon Schlatter, just received the first annual Tim Donatell scholarship.  The scholarship was organized by a group of Tim's pledge brothers to honor him and help out an undergrad brother. 
      This semester we will not be pledging a spring class because there is no room left in the house, but we still need over twenty great guys for next fall.  So, if you know anyone who might be good for the house call or e-mail the rush chair, Jason Ingram (785) 395-0996 x 120;   knowjason@hotmail.com. 
      Other than that we are preparing for the upcoming semester and focusing on integrating this large pledge class into the house. 
Perge, 
Nick Seglie 
Corresponding Secretary

R SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but ma=
y bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers shoul=
d be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jug=
g or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an=
 adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but y=
ou still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to s=
truggle against! a! decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still g=
ive you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , =
WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 1=
1. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stew=
art , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing ga=
me has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to m=
erit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday=
, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a start=
er in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 =
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use th=
eir passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and=
 Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - =
Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty =
of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunda=
y. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner =
, RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up g=
ood stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from a=
n injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't hav=
e another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildc=
ats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Su=
nday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable mat=
chup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, =
and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown =
, WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable rece=
iver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady=
 has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown agains=
t a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updat=
ed 11/21/01Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this s=
eason. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we r=
ecommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden ,=
 WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent =
this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills=
. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your acti=
ve lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills dow=
nfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in =
very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The=
 Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the de=
fense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have=
 been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs =
Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against th=
e Seahawks. While he has ! be! en somewhat of a disappointment, you need to=
 keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held =
out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Wee=
k 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of r=
unning back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as=
 the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout=
 options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richards=
on , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-=
line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score agai=
nst the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative =
ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might =
be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Up=
dated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off bala=
nce on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this w=
eek. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles=
 against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but sho=
uld rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against=
 this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mista=
ke-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the start=
ing lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior t=
o suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyl=
e Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful =
Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week ag=
ainst the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slum=
p.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats ! Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has =
been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holdi=
ng onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sun=
day, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardel=
l , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane=
 Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the pos=
sibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start=
. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you s=
houldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Wo=
ltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his sec=
ond straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in =
your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talent=
ed enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Jo=
seph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could b=
reak off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. H=
owever, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other option=
s at running ba! ck!   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21=
/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance=
 Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight =
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, y=
ou should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence =
Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start i=
n place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wil=
kins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a s=
o-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other o=
ptions at wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 1=
1/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of oppone=
nt. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plumm=
er downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Daw=
gs Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, an=
d you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James=
-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clar=
k , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes=
 thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key =
member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowb=
oys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to sta=
rt one it should definitely be Clark.  More Updates   NFL Reports, Transact=

  Nicole Ohlde scored 17 points as ninth-ranked
Kansas State stayed undefeated in the Big 12 with a 66-61 victory Wednesday
night over Texas A&M.  Laurie Koehn added five more 3-pointers to her NCAA-leading total from the
perimeter. But her biggest contribution came from an intentional foul that sent
her to the line in the final seconds for the Wildcats, who won their 14th
straight game.  Koehn made the second of two free throws and Kansas State got the ball back,
cooling off any chance for a comeback by the Aggies.

Attached is Enron's response against Dynegy's argument that Firm LD contracts cannot be used as designated sources for network transmission pursuant to the FERC OATT.  ComEd allows firm LD contracts to be designated as network resources on a day ahead basis for the Illinois retail program.  Dynegy argues that only "capacity" contracts should be allowed and ComEd's practice deprived Dynegy of at least $2-4 MM of hypothetical capacity payments over the past two years.  Also, attached are responses from other participants, including the Illinois Commerce Commission in favor of the practice.  

Currently, not all transmission providers follow ComEd's practice.  While we are arguing that FERC policy allows Firm LD products to be used as network resources, please check with us before assuming that other TPs will allow this (pending a FERC order in this case).

Due to the holiday, on Friday, December 21 traders will have to use a Custom strip to trade Power deliverable on Wednesday, December 26.  These Custom strips will be used to calculate a separate set of Power Indices which will be published on Friday afternoon along with our regular Daily Power Indices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

MARTIN SHOOTS  WESTERN CAROLINA TO VICTORY
         MANHATTAN, Kan. - Freshman Kevin Martin finished with 29
points, including  six three-pointers, to lift Western Carolina to a
66-64 victory over Kansas  State in a men's college basketball game
Wednesday at Bramlage  Coliseum.
        The win lifted the  Catamounts to 6-3 overall and was their
third straight victory. Western  Carolina won at Florida State on Dec.
8 to start the winning streak. Martin  also had 29 points in the
Catamounts' last outing, a home win over  Guilford.
        The Wildcats fell to 5-4  overall.
        Gilson DeJesus led Kansas  State with 18 points, including a
5-for-7 effort from three-point range.  Travis Reynolds chipped in
with 13 points and 14 rebounds, his third  double-double of the
season. Larry Reid had eight points and six assists for  the Wildcats.
        A 15-point run in a  five-minute stretch early in the second
half helped the Catamounts erase a  45-35 deficit. Casey Rogers had a
pair of three-pointers and Martin scored  five points in the run that
put Western ahead 50-45 with 10:14  left.
        The Wildcats came back to  tie the game four times through the
remainder of the second half but never  regained the lead. Reynolds
scored to tie the game at 60-60 with 2:42 to  play. But Rogers hit one
of two free throws and Freeman converted a basket  after a Wildcat
miss to push the lead back to three  points.
        Pervis Pasco hit one of  two free throws for K-State with 1:15
left, and made only one of two again  after rebounding a Catamount
miss with 35 seconds left, bringing the Wildcats  within 63-62. Kori
Hatcher then hit a pair of foul shots for Western with 21  seconds to
play before Terence Woodyard stole the ball for the visitors  on
K-State's next possession.
         Woodyard hit one of two foul shots with eight seconds left to
put Western  ahead 66-62. Pasco made the final basket for K-State with
0.2 seconds  left.
        K-State hit just 31 percent  from the floor in the second half
on 9-for-29 shooting. The Wildcats, who hit  42 percent from the field
in the game, were also cold from the line, hitting  only 8 of 19 free
throws.
        The  Catamounts hit 54 percent of their shots in the second
half and finished with  a 15-for-18 mark at the foul line in the game.
Kelvin Wylie had seven  rebounds to lead Western on the  boards.
        Kansas State travels to  15th-ranked Iowa on Saturday before
returning home to play Fairleigh  Dickinson on Dec. 29 at 7 p.m.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Our last pick, SYGE has returned more than 30% since December 19th. Today's company
looks like an even bigger winner.

***********************************************************************
OTC Investor
Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB: DTMI)
January 09, 2002
***********************************************************************

The Bear Market appears to have ended and the market has tested important support levels. Recently the NASDAQ has rallied to over 2000, and the DOW has rallied to over 10,000. The accumulation/distribution indicators have turned extremely positive, meaning institutions and mutual funds have started buying stocks. We believe it is time for investors to get back into the market. Our next recommendation, Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB:DTMI), could be one of our top picks of the year. For this reason we here are giving DTMI our highest rating of Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth.

***********************************************************************
Stock Symbol:                    DTMI
Shares Outstanding:              15,400,000
Float (estimated):               2,500,000 (estimated)
Rating:                          Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth
Current Price:                   $2.00
Target Price:                    $7.50
**********************************************************************

About the Company

DTMI is a technology company that turns data into market intelligence. DTMI combines very sophisticated proprietary software that intelligently researches every aspect of business to business databases for company information, products and manufacturing capacity. DTMI utilizes these proprietary databases to create algorithms that compile and sell high-demand corporate intelligence and marketing information. DTMI's combination of technology and expertise quickly identifies new markets and prospects for client's marketing departments. According to DTMI's management, the company has become one of the leading aggregator and distributors of data from disparate corporate sources. This data is melded into a collective, powerful, interlocking matrix of valuable and concise information. Using DTMI's Market Intelligence Tools, a client-company can compile a comprehensive market report (including total market valuation), pinpoint each unique segment within that market, determine the va!
luation and number of companies that make up that segment, then identify actual buyers of its products. Simply put, the value of DTMI to a client-company is this: the comprehensive analysis that DTMI compiles for its clients is usually done in one day or less and costs on average $5000 to $7000. Using a company's own marketing and research department to compile the same information, and generate similiar quality leads, would take weeks or months and cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Revised Earnings

In today's economic climate of layoffs and cost-cutting, companies are looking for ways to save money. DTMI offers a service they cannot afford to pass up. DTMI management is seeing such a rapid acceleration in the number of companies coming to it for services, it has recently revised earnings projections upward. Also, DTMI is signing up clients with longer-term engagements than management had originally projected. This is just one of the reasons we are strongly recommending this stock.

Market Place

Sales of Business Information are expected to reach $58 Billion by 2003 according to Verronis & Suhler. DTMI's market intelligence segment is expected to reach $4 billion in the next several years. As we stated earlier, DTMI's technology can yield detailed market intelligence in a matter of minutes, compared to weeks or more to cultivate the similar data through traditional means, and at an incredible savings. We believe DTMI's technology is far above its competitors, and that it can capture a huge share of its market.

Conclusion

We believe market penetration of 1.5-2% is very achievable for DTMI. That could potentially mean an estimated $80 million-plus in revenues per year. Should the company achieve even half those revenues, our target price will be raised significantly. At $40 million in revenues, and with a 30% net margin, earnings would be $12 million. After-tax income would be $0.54 per share. At a 20 P/E ratio the stock would be worth $10.80 per share; but remember, that's half of what we think it could achieve. Also, according to management, based on early feedback from customers, new business will not be a problem. You can see why we are excited about this stock. Additionally, this company just started trading at $1.70 and, based on the company's quick move out of the blocks, Wall Street is paying attention. At these current price levels the stock is difficult for us to ignore. It looks like DTMI is in a strong upward trend, climbing to higher levels.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? The Top Performers   ? Audibles   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week

    The Top Performers     Want to see where your players rank among the top scorers in your Fantasy league? Click Statistics, Player Scoring on the toolbar. Initially, you'll see a list of your players, in order of the top Fantasy point scorers this season. Choose All Teams and All Positions from the listboxes above the report to view every player in the league, ranked by Fantasy points, and see how your players stack up.  	


    Audibles     Are you searching for that key free agent to propel your team into playoff contention, or to solidify your team's position atop the standings? Let us help. Read Audibles every Wednesday in our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) for our recommended pickups and drops for the week.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Kyle Buhler     My three running backs are: Corey Dillon, Warrick Dunn and Garrison Hearst. Which two should I start in week nine?    Answer - GG     Dillon is far too valuable to bench. That leaves Dunn and Hearst, and neither has been very reliable for Fantasy owners. We'd recommend Dunn based on the matchup. Hearst is facing a tough New Orleans defense that gave up only 66 yards rushing to Curtis Martin a week ago, while Dunn faces a Detroit unit that is allowing an astounding 146.9 rushing yards per game.  	


  Question - Charlie Oddo     Who should I start this week: Charlie Batch or Brian Griese?    Answer - GG     Batch had three straight solid games before stumbling badly this past weekend against San Francisco, and facing Tampa Bay doesn't bode well for his chances in week nine. He may also lose snaps to rookie Mike McMahon over the next few weeks, which is even more reason to avoid him. Griese hasn't been great, but he's still averaging close to two touchdown passes per game and is facing a San Diego secondary that has been very mediocre lately. The choice here is Griese, who is a much more reliable Fantasy QB than Batch, despite the fact that he's thrown nine interceptions in his last four games.  	


  Question - Matt MacLachlan     I need to pick one starter for a "flex" position (meaning any player on my roster can be used at this position.) Should I start Kevan Barlow, Kevin Johnson or Peerless Price?    Answer - GG     Barlow isn't getting enough carries (8.7 per game) to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this time. Price has been unreliable for the most part, and facing a good New England secondary won't help his chances this week. Johnson has been the most consistent player of the three, especially over his last four games. Johnson has averaged 84.2 yards receiving and has four touchdowns over that span, and seems to be your best option.  	


    Tip of the Week      Pete Richards, Reading, PA: After a disappointing rookie campaign, Plaxico Burress is finally showing flashes of the talent he displayed at Michigan State. The emergence of Burress not only raises his own value as a Fantasy player, but it raises the stock of Jerome Bettis, Hines Ward and Kordell Stewart as well. Outside of Bettis, it's quite possible that Burress, Ward and Stewart are still available in many Fantasy leagues, and I feel that all three would make great midseason acquisitions.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg=
 or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out =
of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respec=
table, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts U=
pdated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse im=
pact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still ne=
ed to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle aga=
in! st! a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you se=
rviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Da=
ns Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Ari=
zona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB P=
IT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has imp=
roved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using=
 on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is=
 a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your=
 league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson sh=
ould play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passin=
g game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson w=
ill be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fa=
natics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to=
 locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definit=
ely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK -=
 Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats =
against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury a=
nd New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another =
alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Update=
d 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. Whil=
e he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for t=
he wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you sh=
ould consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - =
Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for h=
is owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been =
throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a medioc=
re Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/0=
1Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'=
ll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend y=
ou get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this seaso=
n, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him =
prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup =
the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated =
11/21/01  There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield fo=
r a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep=
 leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins=
 may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense hon=
est. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been wea=
k against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 1=
1/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawk=
s. While he ha! s ! been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him=
 active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01=
 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of th=
e end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but=
 you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running ba=
ck depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seah=
awks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options.=
 He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB K=
C - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back=
 role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the S=
eahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and=
 if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth =
putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/=
21/0!  The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on S=
unday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We =
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against=
 the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/0=
1 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebo=
und Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this qu=
estionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone=
 quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Ac=
cording to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting line=
up on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffer=
ing an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady =
, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy =
stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against th=
e Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod =
Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held =
down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto th=
e ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, makin=
g him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC=
 - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in=
 Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility o=
f Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardel=
l has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't b=
e counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonde=
rs Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straig=
ht game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your leagu=
e. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough =
to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB =
JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off s=
ome long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we=
 only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at runni=
ng ! ba! ck.  Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Polla=
rd will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulter=
s on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in re=
cent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should=
 probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins ,=
 WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place o=
f the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins coul=
d get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Nine=
rs secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at=
 wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 H=
arrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. Howev=
er, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfi=
eld for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Dawgs Update=
d 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you sho=
uld definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like sta=
ts, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DE=
N - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown h=
is way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of=
 the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will =
likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it=
 should definitely be Clark.  More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]Car=
sons Wildcats Player News  Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01 Brune=
ll's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltim=
ore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn=
't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Qui=
nn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you should=
n't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Ahman Green , Acti=
ve RB Updated 11/21/01 Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week O=
ne, rushing for 157 yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 =
against those same Lions, whose defense is questionable at best.   Kurt War=
ner , Active QB Updated 11/21/01 Warner had a solid game against New Englan=
d last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards and three touchdowns. He's too good t=
o ever consider benching, and will throw at least two touchdowns against Ta=
mpa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   Shannon Sharpe , Active TE Updated 11/2=
1/01 Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one rece=
iving touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced =
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe i=
nto your active lineup every week.  Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/21/01=
 Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend agains=
t New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and =
is worth starting on a weekly basis.   David Patten , Active WR Updated 11/=
21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he =
has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wi=
deout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should =
consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Rod Gardner , Reserve WR U=
pdated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and =
is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough P=
hiladelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy pe=
rspective.   Michael Pittman , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroi=
t defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pi=
ttman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  Freddie =
Jones , Reserve TE Updated 11/18/01 Jones (ankle) has been declared inactiv=
e for Sunday's game. He has been advised not to play for two weeks.  LaDain=
ian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing =
numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall stat=
istics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to=
 do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Matt Stover =
, Active K Updated 10/25/01 Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent=
 him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to=
 published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are =
considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs=
.   Steve Christie , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01 According to published repo=
rts, Christie has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was pla=
ced on injured reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on=
 Tuesday. Drop Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider pi=
cking up Jake Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo=
.   Travis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to th=
e Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not wo=
rth a Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 H=
ead Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Ad=
am Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletch=
er (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' =
final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener=
 against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-roun=
d selection on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensiv=
e back Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee=
 on Saturday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is u=
ncertain of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissio=

=================================================================
Non-Tech Monthly Pick for Active Investors
=================================================================

PETsMART, Inc. - PETM - close: 10.32 change: +0.06 stop: 9.49

Company Description
PETsMART, Inc., is the largest specialty retailer of services and
solutions for the lifetime needs of pets. The Phoenix, AZ-based
company operates more than 550 pet stores in the United States
and Canada, as well as a large pet supply catalog business, and
is the major, controlling investor in the Internet's leading
online provider of pet products and information
(www.petsmart.com).  PETsMART provides a broad range of
competitively priced pet food and supplies, and offers complete
pet training, grooming and adoption services. (source: company
press release)

Why We Like It:
One glance at the chart of PETM and it is easy to see why
investors might be drawn to the stock.  Fortunately, it would
appear that PETM actually has some earnings to back up this
amazing rise in its stock price.  For many investors, 2001 was
not a fun year in the stock market.  Yet for PETM shareholders
they saw a $2.60 share price near its March 2001 lows rise to the
$10.00 level by the end of December 2001.  Management seems to
have good control over some of the challenges of running a 550
store chain while still keeping growth as part of the equation.

PETsMART's latest earnings report, which was for its Q3, came out
back in November but inside there was plenty of information that
investors liked to hear.  We've grabbed a quote from their Q3
earnings press release: "Improvements in key areas such as in-
stocks, inventory management and distribution efficiency, coupled
with the continued growth in our pet services business, drove
sales and profitability during the third quarter," said Phil
Francis, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
PETsMART, Inc. "We've gained a good deal of momentum, and are
positioned for a solid fourth quarter and a strong 2002, when
we'll bring our new store format to 200 existing stores, open 25
to 30 new stores, and continue to drive a company-wide culture of
customer care."

Phil has reason to be positive if the company's numbers keep up
their current pace.  The same Q3 report showed that gross margins
had risen to 28.6 percent, up 390 basis points compared with the
third quarter the year before.  Total sales for the quarter had
jumped 10.6% to $598.6 million while comparable store sales added
7.6 percent over the Q3 of 2000.

The company recently announced that they had bought the remaining
16.3 percent interest in PETsMART.com that they didn't own for
$9.5 million.  In addition to the purchase they would consolidate
the dot.com business and their PETsMART Direct, an equine direct
marketing business, into their overall operations.  Part of this
plan would close certain offices in California and move the
operations to their Phoenix, AZ headquarters.

This announcement came out after the bell on Tuesday, January
22nd and investors were unsure how to interpret the news, which
caused some volatility in the stock price the next day.  Since
then we've seen some selling in the stock but we feel the pull
back towards the $10 level has merely offered us a better entry
point.

On a positive note, the same announcement revealed that the
company had raised their sales growth outlook for the January
quarter from 6 to 7 percent to about 9 percent.  We could not
confirm an actual date but believe PETM will announce its Q4
earnings in late February.

How do we trade the stock from here?

It would be easy to say that on a longer-term basis the stock
could be considered overbought.  However, in this current market
environment where investors are asking, "show me the earnings"
PETM should continue to draw investor interest.  There aren't
many companies right now with strong sales growth and growing
profit margins.  Technically, buyers have been supporting the
stock price every time it dips to the 30-dma during the last
three months (from Nov. 1st).  Shares dipped below this level
mid-week but quickly rebounded.  At the moment, the 30-dma is
near the $10 mark, which can also double as a strong
psychological support level.

We're going to start the play with a stop loss at $9.49, which is
a few cents below the 50-dma but we're only giving the stock this
extra room because we have a two to three month time frame.  More
conservative traders or short-term traders could easily use a
tighter stop loss.  One suggestion would be to place a stop under
Wednesday's low of $9.84.

PETM does have some overhead resistance at the $11 level but the
overall bullish trend should be able to conquer it.  Our
objective is a $12 price target.  This is almost 20% above
current levels.  We suspect that America's new tendency to stay
home and spend money on the house and the family will also
translate into more money on the family pet.

Picked on January 25th at $10.32
Gain since picked:         +0.00

=================================================================
Tech Stock of the Month for Tech Bulls
=================================================================

Cognos Inc. - COGN - close: 25.47 change: +0.48 stop: 23.70

Company Description:
Cognos is the leading global provider of business intelligence
solutions that optimize the performance of the world's largest
and most successful organizations. Founded in 1969, Cognos does
business with more than 19,000 customers in 120 countries around
the world. Cognos business intelligence solutions and services
are also available from more than 3,000 worldwide partners and
resellers. (source: company press release)

Why We Like It:
The software sector has been a jumpy group lately and we're not
seeing a lot of leadership with MSFT trading below its 200-dma.
However, we have noticed a few players in the "business
solutions" group doing okay.  One of those is Cognos Inc.  Shares
of the stock have done very well the last few months and really
jumped higher in December after their Q3 earnings report.  The
stock ran into heavy resistance at the $27 level in early January
but has since consolidated back to the $24 mark with a nice
intraday dip last Wednesday.  Volume was pretty strong on Friday
as bulls pushed shares up almost 2% heading into the weekend.  In
the news, First Albany Corp. recently upgraded COGN to a "buy"
and gave it a $30 price target.  First Albany cited the recent
earnings improvement over the last two quarters and a decent
entry point supporting a decent risk/reward scenario in COGN.  We
happen to agree with them on the entry point idea and don't mind
targeting the $30 level either.  There is still a wall at $27 but
hopefully this time COGN will be able to trade through it.  We
are going to start the play with a stop at $23.70, which is
Wednesday's low.  We still recommend keeping an eye on MSFT and
the GSO.X software index to gauge the market atmosphere.

Picked on January 25th at $25.47
Change since picked:       +0.00
Earnings Date           04/10/02 (unconfirmed)

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

 Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always g=
ets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught =
11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warr=

antasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes De=
mons Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears=
, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn fo=

plosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demon=

 but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down t=

I - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tam=
pa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fanta=
sy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Kens Killers Updated 11/18/01 Booker cau=
ght seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third sea=
son, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must st=
art every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for=
 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliab=
le Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Up! da! =

 to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a rel=
iable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB=
 OAK - Chargers Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Dieg=

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Dear Friends,
First let me thank Melissa and Charles,Jr. for getting the  word out to you about our meeting this week. We will be talking about the Gospel  of John as it relates to the other three Gospels and the beginning of Creation.  So, it is very important for you to have read the first 18 verses of John  1.
Hope to see all of you.
Charles

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford=
 started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minn=
esota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hi=
mself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Commissioner Updated 10/=
21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptio=
ns was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six g=
ames this year and has become a major s! co! ring threat even though he is =
not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Da=
mons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99=
 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for =
the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes i=
t tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 10/21/01=
 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. G=
reen has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a s=
tarting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21=
/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numb=
ers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been=
 so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett ca=
nnot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers=
 Rangers Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, postin=
g seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the b=
est receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Mi=
chael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a gr=
eat outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offens=
e and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity=
, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , =
WR SD - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on =
Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. =
He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certai=
nly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats U=
pdated 10/21/0!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season=
 by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the d=
ay, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond =
Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday=
, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been=
 reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue t=
o start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updat=
ed 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) starte! d ! Sunday's game against San Diego, =
but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two in=
terceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. B=
ut the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does=
 not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect t=
he veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly=
.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seve=
n passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Ter=
rell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anth=
ony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yar=
ds and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's t=
op RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year. =
 Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven =
passes for 100 yards and a TD at ! De! troit. Despite some quiet outings un=
til this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titan=
s lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted =
once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two conse=
cutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of incon=
sistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/21/01 McNair=
 threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He complet=
ed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly=
 indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George =
, RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26=
 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has c=
ertainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a =
TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsisten=
cy, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE A=
TL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards a=
nd a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight e=
nd for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Chargers Update=
d 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It =
is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson=
 , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 r=
eceiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers agains=
t the low-qu! al! ity Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of pr=
oviding owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa=
 Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his F=
antasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently =
score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 =
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, bu=
t he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense=
.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge g=
ame against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He=
's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good n=
umbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Ke=
yshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10=
 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field =
relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to p=
ost high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  J! er! ome Bettis , RB PIT - =
Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 ca=
rries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing p=
roves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate =
, RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game agains=
t the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His=
 role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on =
the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/21/01 ! Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches =
for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Mich=
ael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a r=

FROM Dr OLOGURU
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE
LOME- TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.



DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr OLOGURU, chief accountant for the bills and
credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of
Union Togolaise Du Banque Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.OLOGURU
TEL:00228-911-40-37.

atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 10/18/01 =
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But t=
he Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilg=
er , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in t=
he Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against th=
e underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =
tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=
ew England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Powers Rangers Updated 10/=
18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New=
 England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this wee=
k.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected t=
o start in pl! ac! e of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutiv=
e week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineu=
p.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suua=
lly performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law=
 in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyt=
on Manning , QB IND - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform w=
ell the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots=
 three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participat=
e in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to p=
ractice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off decidin=
g on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  =
Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed pra=
ctice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should =
play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him th=
is week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Feeleys Fanatics Updated ! 10! /18/01 Glenn=
 might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have=
 trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn=
't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18=
/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts=
 this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in h=
is second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Dem=
ons Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far.=
 He could have a ! go! od week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Ra=
ms. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan ar=
ound Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/=
01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held do=
wn by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his do=
wnfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Chargers Updated 10/18/01 Martin w=
ill be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try=
 to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB W=
AS - Kens Killers Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the s=
eason on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player =
due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous ma=
tchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony =
Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre agai=
nst Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards a=
nd one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outsi=
de of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats ! Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he coul=
d have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the =
Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.=
   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde m=
ight not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunis=
tic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of t=
he year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will li=
kely get most of the work at tight ! en! d now that Stephen Alexander is ou=
t. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod =
Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent =
game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth consid=
ering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt ,=
 WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post =
big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time =
Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   =
Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been ve=
ry consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching=
. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets sec=
ondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has =
become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's wort=
h staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on =
your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/18/01 C=
anida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back t=
his weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' off=
ense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   K=
urt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Considering the hug=
e numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every =
week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so b=
e sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans Dawgs U=
pdated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised =
if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. =
Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter wil=
l likely be the more pr! od! uctive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB=
 PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy play=
ers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat =
the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure =
to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Woltys Wonders Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite t=
argets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary=
 is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts=
 Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a spra=
ined medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources sa=
y Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questio=
nable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis=
 , TE PHI - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at pr=
oducing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's =
one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on=
 a weekly basis.   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMA=

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket "Electricity Market Design and Structure," which is the docket FERC is using for its "RTO Week" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

ated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game agains=
t Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during indivi=

lt.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to=
 the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a spra=
ined right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice=
 that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return b=
umps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either ba=
ck against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free A=
gent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury repor=
t on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Det=
roit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger le=
ague this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is =
worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - =
Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be =
the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, =
he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN -=
 DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy =
season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. =
He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspectiv=
e, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter ,=
 WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down so=
mewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The =
veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game a=
gainst rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as proba=
ble for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's =
been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him ba=
sed on his potential to po! st! solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , R=
B NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy =
backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll f=
ace an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, s=
o Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated=
 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwin=
g for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, b=
ut his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especial=
ly against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - D=
amons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Fran=
cisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face =
a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10=
, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS=
 - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginn=
ing the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four g=
ames, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the=
 start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scori=
ng games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has pla=
yed well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's go=
t a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten thro=
ugh the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. =
  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook h=
as been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes =
in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is =
vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.=
   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has bee=
n held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 ya=
rds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however,=
 so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doorm=
ats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starti=
ng him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll =
go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him=
 outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Update=
d 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's onl=
y scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England =
secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team =
based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Po=
wers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals t=
his season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll =
face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wor=
th starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB S=
TL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolin=
a, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a m=
ust-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New =
England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has=
 had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of =
a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, s=
tarting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to=
 do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Won! de! rs Updated 11/16/01 Huntl=
ey will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't=
 be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either =
back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against=
 St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so startin=
g him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11=
/16/01 Walls has be! en! held in check over the last three weeks, but he's =
still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success aga=
inst San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muha=
mmad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somew=
hat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He=
's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco=
, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats=
 Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in th=
e league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vuln=
erable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE =
GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbe=
rs, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy pl=
ayer. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of=
 tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB -=
 Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schro! ed! er (ankle) is not listed on the N=
FL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's =
a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to st=
rong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detr=
oit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has m=
uch Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge ga=
mble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will li=
kely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona.=
 He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a l=

Good Morning...I wanted to let you know that once we get into the new building we will NOT be using the amtel for messages.  Please make sure you have MSN and that it is up and running.  Everyone in the group should already have MSN and we want to make sure we are okay so that you do not miss any messages when you are away from your desk.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks for your help,

Subject: URGENT- ACTION REQUESTED: Admins, please forward to users that have AMTEL equipment... 


Due to desktop space constraints in the new Enron Center South facility, AMTEL equipment will not moved. The replacement for communications will be MSN Messenger. MSN Messenger will allow you to directly communicate with the person you are trying to reach. It will also alert you to their status (Busy, Away, On the Phone, Out to Lunch, etc.). The installation and configuration for MSN Messenger is simple. Please follow the steps listed below carefully to ensure a smooth installation.
 
To install MSN Messenger, first go to the Start Menu -> Programs -> System Utility Applications -> MSN Messenger icon. While navigating to the icon it may be necessary to pull down a "double chevron" if you don't see the folders specified above.
 

 
 
This will launch the setup for MSN Messenger. It should only take a few seconds. The configuration is very simple.
 
 

 
Follow the prompts closely to ensure a smooth setup.
 
On the first screen, titled Welcome to MSN Messenger Service!, click Next ->
 

 
Type in your standard enron.com email address. The format is firstname.lastname@enron.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@enron.com>. Please be sure that "Use this program to talk to my Microsoft Exchange contacts" box is checked. Click Next -> to continue.
 

 
Check the box labeled "Use Exchange Instant Messaging only. (Do not connect to the Internet.)
Click Next -> to continue. Click the Finish button to complete the MSN Messenger setup.
 
After completing the setup wizard, you should be able to sign into the MSN Messenger Service. Click the blue text to sign in
 

 
Next, you will be prompted to confirm your email address. The box should look like this--
 

 
Click the "OK" button. If the connection is successful, you should be able to see a contact list. This is where you can view your contacts status and start communications. To add a person to your contact list, click the Add button. For general help, questions, or to learn the new emoticons ( Telephone receiver <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emphone.gif>,  Boy <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emboy.gif>,  Thumbs up <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/thumbu.gif>, etc.) For direct access to this link, click here <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/HelpWindow_msg.asp?Topic=InfoTech.asp&INI=msgv35.ini&SearchTerm=ffogol&S_Text=signing+in&H_APP=MSN%20Messenger%20Service&BrandID=MSMSGS&Filter=msgrxchg>.
 
Congratulations!
You can now begin using MSN Messenger and reclaim your desktop space.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

rds For Air Ventilation Systems To Tackle Threat Of Bioterrorism  NEW YORK-=
-(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The supplier of filtration systems to the =
U.S. military's chemical weapons destruction program, CECO Environmental (N=
ASDAQ: CECE - news), is calling on governments to implement higher standard=
s for air ventilation systems in public buildings, including airports, subw=
ays, shopping centers and schools.    The FBI has warned of the potential f=
or the release of toxic chemicals, such as cyanide, into air handling syste=
ms of public buildings. Such systems have one or more fresh air intakes and=
 a blower or similar device that moves the air through the ventilation syst=
em.    ``Currently many of these facilities have no effective filters at al=
l in their ventilation systems,'' says Phil DeZwirek, CECO's Chairman and C=
EO. ``Ventilation systems generally are woefully outdated and there is noth=
ing forcing contractors to upgrade them.'' The Building and Office Manageme=
nt Association (BOMA) has told its members that the release of a toxic chem=
ical into an air handling system is a credible threat. ``Any release would =
be spread throughout the entire system within five minutes or less'' accord=
ing to BOMA, which has advised its members to do all they can to make exter=
nal fresh air intakes less accessible.    While CECO recognizes that this i=
s an important first step, it believes the air ventilation systems themselv=
es must be protected. ``We can do this today. CECO has had technology for y=
ears, including filtering systems that capture airborne biological agents,'=
' says DeZwirek.    CECO has been involved with the chemical weapons destru=
ction program since its inception 15 years ago. Its filtering systems were =
engineered into incinerators where several thousand tons of Sarin and VX ne=
rve gas and blister agents have so far been destroyed, along with more than=
 half a million rockets, bombs, mortars and mines.    ``Our technology has =
successfully filtered all particles from the incineration process,'' says D=
eZwirek. CECO has more than three decades of experience dealing with indust=
rial air pollution. In addition, it has developed and deployed systems that=
 protect workers by successfully capturing deadly dust and poisonous gasses=
 that can be produced during the manufacturing process. Its clients include=
 numerous Fortune 100 companies including DuPont, Exxon and U.S. Steel. ``W=
e have always been in the business of saving lives,'' says DeZwirek. ``We h=
ave built a $100-million dollar business in protecting workers and the publ=
ic at large from the scourge of industrial pollutants. Now we are applying =
our vast knowledge and experience to an even more nefarious problem.'' CECO=
 has established an internal task force to outline and provide recommendati=
ons for immediately and affordably implementing technological solutions tha=
t will help keep Americans safe in the commercial workplace.    ``The milit=
ary has safely destroyed tons of deadly nerve gas with the help of CECO tec=
hnology,'' DeZwirek says. ``Similar filters and air ventilation and purific=

ews  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is prob=
able with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Phil=
adelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to =
get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starti=
ng job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR =
- Woltys Wonders Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said M=
onday that Huntley will enter Wee! k ! Seven as the team's starting tailbac=
k. "He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Sei=
fert. "Here's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in y=
our league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Ca=
rolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 10/2=
2/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsbur=
gh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could k=
eep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progre=
ss during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keysh=
awn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sideline=
d for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right =
hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice ! th! is week and could m=
iss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress=
 this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB T=
B - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstri=
ng during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situ=
ation we're going to be in," Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Peters=
burg Times. "Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So =
I don't know who it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker,=
 is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running =
backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/22/0=
1 Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Mi=
nnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he shou=
ld have time to recover. "It'll be OK," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Se=
ntinel. "Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help."  J=
ames Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunda=
y's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankl=
e. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his a=
bsence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Despite a gr=
eat performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune re=
ports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating syste! m ! with hi=
m and James Allen. "We will continue to use them both," said offensive coor=
dinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job today, though." As long as thi=
s duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly=
 starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pic=
k, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left=
 Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to =
be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that =
starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday ag=
ainst Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the =
solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy le=
ague.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered =
a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is a=
lso recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily bas=
is.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffe=
red a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious.=
 He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will =
be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Update=
d! 1! 0/22/01 Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcu=
s Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson own=
er, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions =
for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01=
 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with R=
ackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Fre=
ddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his a=
nkle against Denver. His current! s! tatus is day to day.  Darnay Scott , W=
R CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs agains=
t the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  =
J.R. Redmond , RB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return =
from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't se=
e enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Pow=
ers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His =
status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if=
 Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Alle=
n is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun,=
 the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a =
starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be ev=
aluated on a daily basis. !  Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday =
and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full st=
rength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from thei=
r bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 1=
0/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in th=
e Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again un=
til November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR ST! L ! - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/0=
1 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necess=
arily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully =
so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do bette=
r next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Carsons Wildca=
ts Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that C=
rowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of t=
he season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end =
zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination =
of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus=
 Robinson  , WR CHI - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a =
torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left =
knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of =
the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left i=
n the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receive=
r in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Ri=
chardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-lin=
e packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will =
probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly e=
merged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 1=
0/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards=
 on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards=
 in the second half. "We couldn't do anything in the second half," Williams=
 said. "We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes an=
d made plays." Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against t=
he Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/=
01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 a=
nd 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him =
to be an adequate starter for the rest of th! e ! season.   Tim Biakabutuka=
 , RB CAR - Commissioner Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the=
 fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdow=
n. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradfor=
d , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the =
injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four pass=
es for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player=

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans=
 Dawgs Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game wit=
h the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Z=
ack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is exp=
ected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a ri=
sky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fana=
tics Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's gam=
e against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball durin=
g individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely t=
o play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week a=
s a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will r=
eturn to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games wit=
h a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's =
practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His =
return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use e=
ither back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI =
- Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL inju=
ry report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game aga=
inst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a l=
arger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secon=
dary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , Q=
B CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke =
will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. H=
owever, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , =
QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good =
Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this =
season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy pe=
rspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris =
Carter, WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be =
down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benchin=
g. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good=
 game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday nigh=
t.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed a=
s probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury=
. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench=
 him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams=
 , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fant=
asy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'=
ll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season lon=
g, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, thr=
owing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this seaso=
n, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, espe=
cially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO=
 - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San =
Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll f=
ace a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Wee=
k 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB=
 WAS - Kens K! il! lers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play afte=
r beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his las=
t four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give=
 him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to hi=
gh scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks=
 has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games.=
 He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be bea=
ten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy l=
eagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Wes=
tbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown=
 passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend =
that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth cons=
idering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner=
 has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes f=
or 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, =
however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons=
 Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so =
starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. =
He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid usi=
ng him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats =
Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he=
's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New En=
gland secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy=
 team! b! ased on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR=
 STL - Powers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy=
 totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the leagu=
e. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's =
still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Fau=
lk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game agains=
t Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league.=
 He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 aga=
inst New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Co=
nwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is som=
ewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, h=
owever, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choi=
ce but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 =
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but =
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting ei=
ther back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend ag=
ainst St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so st=
arting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he'=
s still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success a=
gainst San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Mu=
hammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a som=
ewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. =
He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francis=
co, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doorma=
ts Updated 11/16/01 Favre has be! en! one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks =
in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very=
 vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks =
, TE GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage =
numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fanta=
sy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the ty=
pe of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR=
 GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the =
NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's=
 a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to s=
trong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  [I=

 Journal Members:      [IMAGE] Year End Update on Astralis LTD (OTC BB: AST=
R)   [IMAGE]  We started covering Astralis at the end of September, prior t=
o the completion of a merger which made Astralis a public company. At the t=
ime we were very excited about the public having the opportunity to get in =
on the ground floor of a potential medical breakthrough at a valuation comm=
ensurate with levels generally reserved for sophisticated investors in the =
biotech industry.   While the stock has been lackluster for the last two mo=
nths, the company announced an Agreement on December 12th which serves to r=
einforce our original hypothesis.   By way of reminder, Astralis "has compl=
eted clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxine to trea=
t 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positively with =
few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved complete remi=
ssion, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction in diseas=
e of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity In=
dex (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the patients had =
a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not yet been =
independently verified." from December 12 press release.   On December 12th=
, Astralis revealed it had entered into several agreements with SkyePharma =
PLC (NASDAQ: SKYE), a British pharmaceutical company which specializes in d=
rug delivery technologies.   The press release revealed that Astralis will =
pay a $5 million license fee for drug deliveries technologies. Conversely, =
SkyePharma will invest $20 million directly into Astralis in the form of a =
convertible preferred security in return for 15.3% of the company.   SkyePh=
arma's investment of $20 million in return for 15.3% of the company implies=
 they see upside in Astralis' technology at a $130 million valuation, a lev=
el from which they certainly hope and intend to make a substantial return o=
n their investment.   Based on the current price of the stock, and our esti=
mate of 38 million shares issued and outstanding, the market is currently p=
lacing a value on the company of just over $100 million.   Simply put, this=
 means Astralis can be purchased up to about $3.40 per share before you are=
 paying more than SkyePharma was willing to pay. They are investing $20 mil=
lion.   SkyePharma's revenues were up 40% through the first six months of 2=
001, an explosive growth rate and the sign of a well managed company.   Loo=
k for this stock to start behaving better in 2002. Once the funding is comp=
leted, Astralis will be positioned to apply for an upgraded listing to eith=
er the NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange.   The risk associated with an=
 investment in Astralis is mitigated greatly by the capital they now have t=
o fund the New Drug Application and a partnership with a successful interna=
tional biotech company.   Here is the complete text of the news release for=

eements For Promising New Psoriasis Treatment  LONDON, and FLORHAM PARK, N.=
J., Dec. 12 /PRNewswire -- SkyePharma PLC (Nasdaq: SKYE; LSE: SKP) and Astr=
alis LTD (OTC Bulletin Board: ASTR - news) announce several agreements conc=
erning the formulation and development of Astralis' novel injectable vaccin=
e therapy, Psoraxine(TM), for the treatment of all forms of psoriasis, a ch=
ronic skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world population. =
  Under the terms of a technology access agreement, SkyePharma will receive=
 from Astralis a US$5 million license fee, which will be recognised as reve=
nue over the lifetime of the contract, for access to DepoFoam and other rel=
evant drug delivery technologies. In addition, through a service agreement,=
 SkyePharma will provide all development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and c=
linical development services for second generation Psoraxine, up to the com=
pletion of Phase II clinical studies. On completion of Phase II studies, As=
tralis will offer SkyePharma the option to acquire the worldwide licensing =
and distribution rights to Psoraxine. If SkyePharma does not take the optio=
n, Astralis will seek a marketing partner to fund Phase III clinical studie=
s and to provide a sales and marketing infrastructure. It is anticipated th=
at an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to start Phase I-B clinica=
l studies will be filed with the US Food and Drug Administration in the fir=
st half of 2002.   In a separate transaction, SkyePharma will make a total =
equity investment in Astralis of up to US$20 million in convertible preferr=
ed shares, on payment for which SkyePharma will own 15.3% of Astralis. Skye=
Pharma will make an initial investment of US$10 million on signature of the=
 agreement. The remaining US$10 million investment will be paid at times an=
d in quantities, amongst other conditions, dependent on the date of filing =
the US IND, up to January 31, 2003.   There is no approved cure for psorias=
is. Most approved treatment protocols provide temporary or incomplete relie=
f and may, with certain systemic treatments, cause serious side effects. Ps=
oraxine, developed by Astralis' Chairman Dr. Jose Antonio O'Daly MD, PhD, i=
s a protein that stimulates cells from the patient's immune system to rever=
se the inflammatory process responsible for psoriasis symptoms.   Astralis =
has completed clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxin=
e to treat 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positiv=
ely with few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved comp=
lete remission, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction =
in disease of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Se=
verity Index (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the pati=
ents had a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not =
yet been independently verified.   Professor James Leyden, a Board member o=
f the American Academy of Dermatology and past chairman of the Dermatology =
Foundation, said, ``I have had the opportunity to review the data generated=
 in Venezuela, and was very encouraged by the results. I believe Psoraxine =
could be an exciting new treatment alternative for many of the world's psor=
iasis sufferers. We look forward to becoming an integral part of the ongoin=
g clinical program.''   Michael Ashton, SkyePharma's chief executive office=
r commented, ``Our ability to provide Astralis with manufacturing, pre-clin=
ical, clinical and regulatory services, as well as access to a broad drug d=
elivery technology platform, makes SkyePharma ideally suited to their needs=
. We, in turn, are very excited by the opportunity to share in Astralis' pr=
omising discovery. It is rare to find a potential drug that has already sho=
wn such encouraging, early-stage clinical results in around 3,000 patients.=
''   Astralis' Chief Executive Officer, Mike Ajnsztajn, said, ``We are exci=
ted to enter into this agreement with SkyePharma, because they have a prove=
n track record in achieving FDA approval for novel products as evidenced by=
 the dermatological product, Solaraze, indicated for actinic keratosis. Thi=
s relationship will enable us to validate the results from our prior clinic=
al studies and to move aggressively toward gathering the necessary data for=
 US regulatory and marketing approval. SkyePharma's equity investment confi=
rms our collective commitment to introduce this promising product.''   This=
 press release may contain forward-looking statements regarding SkyePharma =
PLC or Astralis LTD. Actual results may differ materially from those descri=
bed in the press release as a result of a number of factors, including but =
not limited to the following: There can be no assurance that Psoraxine will=
 be successfully developed or manufactured, or that final results of human =
clinical trials will result in the regulatory approvals required to market =
products, or that final regulatory approval will be received in a timely ma=
nner, if at all, or that patient and physician acceptance of this product w=
ill be achieved. SkyePharma PLC and Astralis LTD undertake no obligation to=
 revise or update any such forward-looking statement to reflect events or c=
ircumstances after the date of this release.   Notes   Astralis LTD, an eme=
rging biotechnology company based in New Jersey, focuses on the research an=
d development of novel treatments for immune system disorders and skin dise=
ases. Psoraxine, the company's first product, is an innovative drug under d=
evelopment for psoriasis, and is based on the company's discovery of a new =
gene sequence of proteins. To date, clinical data suggest remission of this=
 skin condition in patient trials in Venezuela.   SkyePharma PLC, an establ=
ished drug delivery company, based in the UK, provides innovative services =
to major pharmaceutical partners from the point of drug discovery through t=
he approval process. Its five technologies, oral, injectable, inhalation, t=
opical, and nanoparticulate solubilisation encompass the vast majority of d=
elivery systems in use by the pharmaceutical industry. For more information=

Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically based remitting and relapsing scaly and=
 inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world's po=
pulation. Psoriasis symptoms result from the overproduction of skin by bloo=
d cells associated with the immune system. These blood cells become confuse=
d and act as though the skin was damaged, manufacturing skin cells at a muc=
h faster rate than is required by undamaged skin. The overproduction of ski=
n can cause everything from itchy rash like patches to painful pustules and=
 massive inflammation. Most current treatments are sub-optimal and some sys=
temic treatments can cause serious side effects.    Additional information =

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

, rushing for only 54 yards in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pit=

rey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 The Jaguars held Dill=

  T.J. Houshmandzadeh , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Houshmandzadeh=

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

ugg or Nuts Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami=
 Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from=
 his second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Power=
s Rangers Updated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He =
broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CI=
N - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable =
for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss =
the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Alle=
n , RB CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Al=
len will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Viki=
ngs lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Wee=
k 11.   Anthony Thomas! , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01Accordi=
ng to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam=
e against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely =
be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -=
 Chargers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He ga=
ined only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for m=
ost of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/0=
1 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list=
 Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught=
 just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.=
    James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushe=
d for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stin=
ger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained righ=
t ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons=
 Doormats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdow=
ns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series=
 in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch s=
aid he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His st=
atus for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at =
Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunda=
y's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution,=
 but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks =
in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  =
  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven cat=
ches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also wen=
t over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best r=
eceiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DE=
N - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. H=
e has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  ! Olandis Gary=
  , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left =
leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest o=
f the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis mig=
ht be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Update=
d 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump=
 against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he m=
ay catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01=
! The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis=
' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start hi=
m every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent =
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats a=
nd may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated =
11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense=
 has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner=
 Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent w=
eeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basi=
s. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, =
but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell=
 Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very we=
ll at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on t=
o open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key rece=
iver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanat! ic! s Update=
d 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brow=
n downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brow=
n into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Door=
mats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the =
Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York =
is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative =
on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 P=
atten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has bee=
n inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. =
Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should conside=
r using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers=
 Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners th=
is season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him=
 the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints se=
condary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or N! ut! s Updated 11/21/01 Smith =
has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go u=
p against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get =
him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or=
 Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and =
we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove h=
imself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the rem=
ainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/0=
1 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few =
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues=
.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use=
 Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He =
could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak agains=
t the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 =
Gonzalez will rack up good! F! antasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. Wh=
ile he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active e=
very week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis ru=
shed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zon=
e once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may =
have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth =
around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Par=
ker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' sec=
ondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might=
 make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free =
Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in =
recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks o=
n Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you a=
re in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting i=
