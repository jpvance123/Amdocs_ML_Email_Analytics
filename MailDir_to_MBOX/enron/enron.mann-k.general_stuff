Could you check with David and see if he could fax copies of the PowerPoint 
plates to me in Portland so we have a fighting chance of following along by 
tying in by phone?    If that is possible, try to send them by Tuesday. Thank 
you very much.

Kay-

Here is some initial information regarding the process.  I am asking Lloyd to 
forward the control area contract documents he and David Portz have been 
working on.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: Control Area Certification

Regan attached below is the process that Clarksdale has to start to become a 
Control Area in case they don't have it.

We should be able to get our systems hooked up to them in 60 days once we 
have the green light from Ozzie to charge (approx $300K).

It will be tough to get their portion done in less than 4-6 months due to the 
dependency on others who tend to not cooperate.

One of the major items we need to help them with is completing their 
Interconnection agreement and get this process started and then some form of 
Services contract that can be used for the audit, I have a draft one that I 
will forward to you by end of the week.

Thanks.

Keith,
The Certification process is initiated at the NERC level and the Region
will respond when notified by NERC.  I have attached all the files that
represent the NERC and SPP Certification procedures.

I have been attempting to find information on how to become a Control
Area
in SPP. I have not been able to find any area to help yet and I was
directed to the both of you for help. Any information you could provide
would be helpful.
Thanks,

I don't know if you got this, so here 'tis.  I was out of town and missed the 
presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these 
issues.  I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for 
others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet 
treatment of power plants.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

Hello Marcus,

I heard a rumor that you have a form of tolling agreement.  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to look at it, just to see what one looks like 
since I hear tolling agreements discussed.  I understand it hasn't been 
signed yet.

Thanks,

Kay

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Subject: Environmental Permits Matrix

Attached is a generic spreadsheet that lists environmental activities and 
approvals for power projects.  I have divided it into three different sheets 
that represent:  1) activities/permits required prior to construction, 2) 
activities/permits after start of construction and prior to commercial 
operation, and 3) activities/permits after start of commercial operation. 

I see it being a worthwhile effort to produce a separate list for each 
project, including schedule milestones and responsible parties.  Whether each 
list is generated by me, an environmental consultant, legal counsel, the 
developer, etc. is something we should decide on a project by project basis.  
I would appreciate your comments on this.

By the way, I don't consider this generic spreadsheet to contain an 
exhaustive list of possible permits.  There are a number of other potential 
approvals, such as occupancy permit, driveway permit, environmental resource 
permit, etc. that aren't on this spreadsheet.  We really need to assess each 
project individually.

Dave

I think that is a great observation.  I would suggest that the language be 
fairly broad to include both potential assignees and potential 
investors/joint-venturers.  You might also consider anticipating some of our 
counterparties' concerns by including a provision like this  . . . . so long 
as such potential assignee or potential investor/joint venturer enters into 
an agreement to protect the confidentiality of such information.  This is an 
easy give because we always get a CA in place before disclosing information.  
I would steer clear of any modification to that provision which requires (i) 
a minimum term for the CA, (ii) agreement by the counterparty to the form of 
CA or (iii) the proposed assignee or potential investor to put itself in 
direct privity with the counterparty.

Just my thoughts

Stuart

Applied Finance - January 25 & 26, 2001 in EB552     Cost:  $700.00

If a better understanding of Enron's transactions (a deal) that involves 
Enron's financial as well as commercial participation with another business 
entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you. 

This course will give you a firm grasp of basic finance but in the context of 
Enron's commercial and financial transactions.
The objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, 
to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the 
structure of a deal and provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that 
you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

To register for any of these classes, click here (), or call 713 853-0357.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Here's the next to last iteration of the form contract before we christen
it officially "FORM 2000 - Rev. 00",clean and compared. John R will need to
take this, diddle with it,  and use the product PDQ for a couple of crisis
applications, but before it becomed and gets advertized as "Form 2000" I
woanted to collect  last comments from you guys and get some fine tuning
from  our litigation mangers  onthe arbitration and dispute resoluton
materials, which is to be on my desk by the end of the day.
Because of Johnnie's urgencies, I did not have the chance to pretty up
format and section and page numbers, please forgive. We will get it next
time.

You guys also have the un-revised draft exhibits. I think Rigby was to
revise to try and revise them to fit  the form - I await the draft exhibits
withbaited breath.

Please collect your thoughts and we we schedule a time to get tehm in.

Angie, please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=

America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

Elizabeth:  here is the PECO e-mail I referred to.  After skimming it, I 
realize that if you find it at all worthwhile, you may ask to see a copy of 
the PECO/Great Bay lawsuit and the agreement involved.  I'll see if Nellie 
can locate that as well.  John

Elizabeth:

Following up on our conversation last week, I have an associate pulling some 
of the relevant authority on the fiduciary duty/principal--agent issues we 
discussed in the context of some of the deals ECT is considering with respect 
to marketing the output of generation units of third party owners.  We should 
be able to get back to you this week with our thoughts in that respect and we 
will forward to you the major authorities, articles, etc.  that we come up 
with.

My sense of the market is that it is likely that ECT may be approached by 
many owners of power plants as the markets further deregulate and some of the 
owners of "hard assets" realize that they do not have the resources necessary 
to participate in the wholesale power markets.  And, with the further market 
participant fall-out to come (witness PacifiCorp's retrenchment announcement 
on Friday), ECT could end up with a larger share of this market perhaps 
resulting in multiple deals with third parties, even parties whose facilities 
may be viewed in competition with one another (based on load pockets, grid 
interconnection, etc.).  I agree with you that these deals carry a lot of 
legal risk because of ECT's commanding presence in these markets.

In addition, I found the PECO marketing contract with Great Bay Power ("GBP") 
that, as you know, resulted in litigation earlier this year.  I faxed it to 
you this morning along with a copy of the complaint that GBP filed against 
PECO earlier this year.  Set forth below are a few of the key aspects of the 
PECO/GBP Contract that I thought you might find of interest, including some 
of the contract language that bears on the fiduciary duty/ principal-agent 
considerations.  I thought it made sense to focus on some of these, not 
because it is a great contract, but I think it illustrates many of the 
concepts that your commercial people may wish to employ in the proposed 
marketing deals they are currently examining.  Further, you will see how many 
of the key provisions dealing with the key legal concepts are either unclear 
or confusing or never really addressed.

1.  Term; Exclusive Agent Relationship.  The Contract was for an initial term 
of 2 years.  PECO is designated to act as GBP's exclusive agent in marketing 
the power from GBP's only asset; namely, its interest in the Seabrook nuclear 
plant.  Except as noted in Paragraph 2 below, GBP could not sell to customers 
without PECO's consent.  GBP apparently sought the PECO deal since it needed 
a party to "firm up" its sales; that is, it needed a party to back up its 
Seabrook power in the event Seabrook went down.  GBP retained title to all 
power until title passed to third parties.  Of further note is that in 
connection with the contract PECO also received a warrant to purchase up to 
4.9% of the stock of GBP.  (This is similar to what ECT proposed with El Paso 
a year or so ago, but ECT proposed a warrant to purchase a greater percentage 
of the stock of El Paso.)  Note that the 4.9% limit is '35 Act driven.  More 
than 4.9% would be a "second bite" under the '35 Act that would require prior 
SEC approval and, in addition, could be problematic for PECO under the 
limitations of such Act.

2.  PECO's Authority to Effect Deals for GBP.  PECO could effect transactions 
for GBP, although it could not execute deals of  more than a year in duration 
without GBP's consent.  PECO also had the right to negotiate "on behalf of" 
GBP enabling agreements (such as those necessary to effect NEPOOL 
transactions), although those agreements would only become effective upon 
GBP's consent (which could not be unreasonably withheld).  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, GBP could cause PECO to offer a sale of power on terms 
directed by GBP if the sale was for longer than six months, provided GBP 
could not require PECO to firm up such sale.  If PECO felt this was not the 
best course of action, it could terminate the Contract.

3.  PECO Standard of Care.  Sec. 4(a) of the Contract provides that "PECO 
shall use 'reasonable best efforts' to arrange for the sale of the [GBP 
Power]" and that it "shall use the same care and diligence in arranging 
Transactions [involving the GBP power] as it uses in the sale of capacity 
and/or energy owned by PECO."  PECO was authorized and required to use 
"reasonable judgment" during the negotiation and scheduling of transactions 
under the Contract.

4.  Conflicting Sales Opportunities.  Sec. 4(c) denominated "Bundling of 
Initial Power Amount" is of particular interest.  Effectively, this provision 
requires that if some of the GBP power is available but not committed and 
PECO has other NEPOOL power available to it that can be used to effect a 
sale, then PECO shall be obligated to serve each such sale with both the GBP 
power and its own NEPOOL resources "until the [GBP power] is fully 
utilized."  It is not exactly clear how this provision is intended to work, 
but I would assume that if PECO located a candidate for a sale transaction 
and PECO could use its own NEPOOL power  (defined as "Other NEPOOL Supply") 
to serve it or, alternatively, it could use the GBP power, then PECO would 
have to make the sale using both sources of power.  It is not clear whether 
PECO would have to apply the GBP first or whether a pro rata concept (perhaps 
based on the ratio of the GBP power to the total power available) would be 
permissible.  Obviously, this type of a provision would have major 
implications for the considerations we have been discussing since ECT would 
not want to be required either to use its counterparty's power first to make 
a sale or to apply some form of pro rata concept (which would be incredibly 
difficult to apply and a ticket to litigation).

5.  Notice of Conflicting Opportunities.  Sec. 4(d) of the Contract, 
denominated "Economic Disincentive," similarly is interesting (and 
confusing).  It provides, in effect, that if a portion of the GBP power is 
uncommitted but PECO owns Other NEPOOL Supply and PECO would make more of a 
margin by selling the Other NEPOOL Supply for its own account than effecting 
a deal for the GBP power, then "PECO shall notify GBP of such 
circumstances."  What is interesting is that it just requires PECO to notify 
GBP; it does not appear that there is any restriction on PECO's right to sell 
such power, except perhaps the restriction set forth in Sec. 4(c) above.  
Perhaps the negotiators of the Contract know how these provisions tie 
together, but it is not clear from the Contract itself.  This is very 
surprising since one would think that it would have been in both parties' 
interests to make it absolutely clear how the fiduciary duty/corporate 
opportunity responsibilities were to be handled.

6.  Compensation.  With respect to compensation, PECO paid GBP a "reservation 
fee" in consideration of GBP retaining PECO as its exclusive agent, which was 
based on a $ per MWh basis.  GBP paid a "service fee" to PECO based on a % of 
net sales revenues.  (It really wasn't on a net basis, however, since it 
effectively was based on gross revenues less transmission and ancillary 
services costs).

7.  Commitments for Future Opportunities.  Another interesting feature of the 
Contract was the parties' commitments to engage in "future joint 
opportunities."  For example, Sec. 13(a) states that "PECO shall be obligated 
to provide Great Bay with the opportunity to participate in all purchases of 
[additional favorably priced power from facilities in New England having a 
term in excess of 1 year]." (Emphasis added).  As with many other provisions 
of the Contract, it is not clear what happens if PECO and GBP do not agree on 
the sharing of costs, revenues, etc. with respect to such additional 
opportunities.

8.  Early Termination Rights.  In addition to termination for a breach of the 
Contract, GBP could terminate upon 30 days notice prior to certain dates 
(tied to the warrant expiration date).  PECO, as noted at paragraph 2 above, 
could terminate on 90 days notice if GBP elected to effect a sale on its won 
(that essentially PECO felt would not maximize the parties' profits).

9.  Choice of Law.  PECO was able to get Pennsylvania law to be the governing 
law.  Presumably, this was a function of the fact that GBP had less 
negotiating leverage and "needed" PECO to help it with firming up its sales.

10.  The Litigation.  In its complaint, GBP alleged, among other things, that 
since inception of the Contract PECO only effected two firm energy 
transactions for GBP.  In addition, it asserted that PECO entered into a 
number of wholesale transactions for its own benefit, rather than in the name 
of GBP.

I apologize for the length of this E-mail, but in light of the importance of 
these issues to the deals ECT is considering, I thought it made sense to give 
a flavor of the PECO/GBP contract.  We will be back to you later this week 
with the outcome of our research.  Please call me if you have any questions 
or need anything else.

John

 In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures 
on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.

Election was $2400. Paid to date is $784 and I have an additional $712 to
submit. Hopefully they will pay even though the insurance declined to cover
it. So, that leaves a balance of $904 and we will owe Sharon $200 or so by
the end of this month. Depending on what happens after that we might have
another $250 or so from Sharon by the last of December. Best guess, $500 or
so we need to cover somewhere.

Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending
account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My
records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.

I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals. They will not pay. If the
reimbusement account pays it will leave about $900.00 in the account. I
will
try to get the form completed tonight and in the mail tomorrow.

FIVE GREAT LESSONS:

1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our 
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed 
through the questions,until I read the last one: "What is the first name of 
the woman who cleans the school?" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had 
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last 
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last 
question would count toward our quiz grade. "Absolutely," said the professor. 
"In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 
'hello'." "I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was 
Dorothy.

2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an 
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway 
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next 
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those 
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance 
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down 
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's 
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
special note was attached. It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God 
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others." Sincerely, Mrs. Nat 
King  Cole.

3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days 
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel 
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of 
him.
"How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifty cents," replied the 
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the 
coins in it. "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired. By 
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied." The little boy again 
counted his coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.  The waitress 
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy 
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came 
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly 
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he 
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a 
tip.

4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a 
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to 
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest 
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly 
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about 
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load 
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move 
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he 
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he 
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse 
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold 
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant 
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an 
opportunity to improve our condition. 

5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I 
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz 
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of 
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who 
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies 
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his 
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
deep breath and saying, "Yes, I'll do it if it will save her." As the 
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we 
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale 
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling 
voice, "Will I start to die right away?" Being young, the little boy had 
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister 
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and 
attitude, are everything.

Kay, here's the near to last draft of the  form. Sorry of the delay and
thanks for being a sport about it, especially when your dvelope rtypes are
needig to get on down the road.. Please feel free to work on this, but
please  don't distribute this as our form, as you can see from the note
below that we still have a way to go before it is  the "form',but remaining
work is limited to speific content here and there, typos ,and some
litigation sturff. The structure will remain, so you can safely work into
this the West LB stuff.

John R. asked that  you and he have a chat about the directionyou are
headedand hwo to coordinate the changes that need to be made - in terms of
substance as awell as drafting - to get to an standard set of changes for
the off balance sheet work. I would be glad to participate.

Subject:  Form Contract, Rev Minus 1

Here's the next to last iteration of the form contract before we christen
it officially "FORM 2000 - Rev. 00",clean and compared. John R will need to
take this, diddle with it,  and use the product PDQ for a couple of crisis
applications, but before it becomed and gets advertized as "Form 2000" I
woanted to collect  last comments from you guys and get some fine tuning
from  our litigation mangers  onthe arbitration and dispute resoluton
materials, which is to be on my desk by the end of the day.
Because of Johnnie's urgencies, I did not have the chance to pretty up
format and section and page numbers, please forgive. We will get it next
time.

You guys also have the un-revised draft exhibits. I think Rigby was to
revise to try and revise them to fit  the form - I await the draft exhibits
withbaited breath.

Please collect your thoughts and we we schedule a time to get tehm in.

Angie, please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me.

Kay--I can confirm to you that under Virginia case law, it appears that the 
parties to a contract can agree to exclude consequential damages.  Also, 
there is no implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under current case 
law. A memo regarding these conclusions is attached.

http://invite.bluemountain.com/view/2BB-EEX7-PAFY

Hope to see you at my birthday party...It's not for quite some time, but this 
is a darn good way to procrastinate on my paper. My mom hasn't for sure 
secured it with Kenneally's, but it should be there...I'll let you know if it 
moves and give you directions and such in the summer. I just want to get an 
idea of who is even available. It's a Thursday night, but heck that's close 
enough to Friday. Some people can definitely stay at my house. Oh, and for 
your SU people, it's the last day of Mayterm, so you won't have class the 
next day anyway. Have a great weekend, and let me know if you might be able 
to make it.

Please find two presentations attached for your information.  The first 
presentation is our standard presentation on power plant development 
activities which covers many of the issues we discussed yesterday.  The 
second presentation is our standard presentation on fair value investments.  
We also spend a considerable amount structuring transactions under the fair 
value accounting model.

If it would be beneficial to the legal group, I would be more than happy to 
set up a presentation/working meeting where we could go through the 
presentations and review in more detail. 

If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.

Regards.

I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information 
regarding some of the titles for various employees.  Please verify that the 
titles are correct for everyone in your group.  The ones that I made changes 
to are in red.

Thanks, Paula.

I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet.  Please 
use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier.

Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=
he=20
commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the followin=
g=20
organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=
ll=20
include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=
ny=20
(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=
on=20
Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =
as=20
Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=
=20
of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=
=20
Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=
e=20
variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=
 on a=20
global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=
e=20
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage=
=20
as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

Attached are 3 updated Word forms for requesting new US entities (Corp, LLC, 
LP).  Unless you have access to our automated HotDocs system for requesting 
Secretary of State corporate activities, please use the attached forms (and 
delete data files for older versions).  Although these forms are not as user 
friendly as our HotDocs templates, they have been conformed as nearly as 
possible to the HotDocs forms, and are now as automated as MicroSoft Word 
will allow.  I think you will find these a great improvement over our old 
forms.  Please forward these new forms to anyone in your group who might need 
to create a new domestic entity.

I continue work on HotDocs templates and Word forms for authorization of US 
mergers, acquisitions, name changes, and for similar activities for non-US 
entities, and will make those available to you ASAP.  In the meantime, if you 
have any questions or comments regarding Corp Services forms, please contact 
me via email or call me at Ext 37291.

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many 
transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws 
and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether 
Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence 
of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review 
the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and 
discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.

Thank you.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

Kay,

 Joe Curreri at ENSR wanted me to let you know that he is still waiting on 
the signed extension letter (Master Services Agreement).  Once you initial 
it, please have someone deliver it to Janet Dietrich as she then needs to 
sign it before sending it back to Joe at ENSR.  Please let me know if there 
is anything I need to do to get this process completed.  Thanks.

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=
s=20
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =

these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=

origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=

Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This afternoon you will receive a Logon ID and Password to a secure website 
known as LegalNetEx ("LNX").   LNX will provide the Enron/GE Turbine Contract 

Team with a centralized location for the efficient and organized exchange of 
contract drafts and revision proposals.  It works like this:

1.  When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most 
recent version of the contract.   To review and revise the contract you will 

download the document onto your PC or LAN.     

2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised 
version of the contract on your system, under a new name.  

3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the 
rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX.  Peter Thompson 
will 
receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised 
document.  

4.  When Peter  has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, 
he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX.    Each team member will 

receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and 
greatest version of the contract. 
   

Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Attached is a Client Alert, which discusses amendments to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that were signed this
week by the President.  As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger
notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size
thresholds.

The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions
that close on or after that date.  As anticipated, the amendments increase
the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they
eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold.  They also
eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value
exceeding $200 million.  Congress projects that about half of filings will
be eliminated under the new thresholds.  The amendments also adopt a
three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger
transactions.

Kay,  you bring up an excellent point.  We have addressed this issue in at 
least two of the form contracts that I am familiar with; however, I believe 
only recently. See Section 7.5 of our Dedicated Reserves Form Contract  
provides: 

".......Buyer shall not disclose ......to any third party(other than the 
Party's and its affiliates' employees, lenders, counsel, accountants or 
prospective purchasers of any contract rights, general intangibles or 
accounts hereunder,[ it does not say this in our current form, however I 
would suggest considering  adding here "whether in an asset sale , financing 
or equity transaction"] in each case who have agreed to keep such terms 
confidential")...................

Sec tion 8.8 of the Enfolio Master Purchase / Sale (natural Gas) form 
contract contains a similar provision.

I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
forms allow this.

I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors" 
whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
effective solution?  

Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
issue.

Subject: Interconnection Information

Barbara, Steve and Jeff--Below is information I sent out last year (as 
updated today) dealing with some interconnection issues.  I look forward to 
working with you on interconnection and other power transmission issues.  
Thanks.  Christi





This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding 
interconnecting generation plants in the East.  Please forward this to your 
groups.  Thanks.  Christi Nicolay 37007  EB3132a.   I am available for your 
federal/FERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct 
state/regional regulatory people.

When initially deciding where to site a plant, there are several federal 
regulatory issues to consider:  

First, you will need to obtain the utility's interconnection policy and a pro 
forma interconnection agreement from the utility.  For most utilities, you 
will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement.  Some utilities 
have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page.  The OASIS 
sites have areas that do not require a password, but if the information is 
not available in that area, you should contact the power trading desk 
transmission personnel to assist in locating the information.  If a utility 
says it does not have a policy, you can let me know.

The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for 
the utility to study the interconnection (Typically, app. $10,000).  When you 
return the money and the request (which is usually an agreement that must be 
initialled by ENA legal), the project will be placed in the "queue."  The 
queue is usually available on the OASIS.  If the utility does not post the 
queue, let me know.  

Many times the procedures require the project to meet "milestones" in order 
to remain in the queue.  If the milestones look unreasonable, let me know.

FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) recently issued an order 
(Tennessee Power case) in which FERC stated that asking for "interconnection" 
is separate from a request for "transmission" under a utility's Open Access 
Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an 
order dealing with interconnection.  Many utilities will try to charge 
additional "network upgrade" costs, not simply the costs to interconnect.  
This is not necessary allowed under the new FERC rule, because such costs 
should be charged when a separate request for transmission is made  (Note: 
PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure).  

In addition, in the Tennessee Power case, FERC stated that utilities are 
required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study 
process.  Generally, these timelines are in the attachment below.  Most of 
the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer 
than what FERC is now requiring.  You should probably first call the utility 
to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERC's new 
order.  If that doesn't work, you can call me.   FERC has approved some 
longer deadlines in certain utility specific filings.

There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures 
at FERC:  for example PJM, NEPOOL, VEPCO, Ameren, Entergy, ComEd, Arizona 
Pub. Serv., CP&L.  FERC has issued orders in most of the filings.

An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement.  Generally, I 
review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective.  It is 
important to have someone in Enron's Genco review it if Enron will own or 
operate it after in-service or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the 
plant.  The interconnection agreement usually contains operational 
provisions, including imbalance provisions, that are typically very one sided 
toward the utility, so it is important to have Enron technical input before 
the agreement is executed.

Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for 
transmission.  You should consult the power trading desk transmission people 
in order to determine whether a request for firm or non-firm transmission 
needs to be made.  The desk can make the request if necessary.  While the 
desk may choose to use daily/hourly non-firm transmission for some of the 
Enron plants, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis.  You do not want 
your plant to be "stranded" without the ability to wheel electricity away 
from the busbar, unless you are building a plant in order to sell power 
directly to the interconnected utility, and even then, you may want to wheel 
power around at times.

If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power 
from the plant, the plant/Enron may have to pay "network upgrades."  You want 
to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm (priority) basis 
if you pay for network upgrades.  Some utilities simply provide "transmission 
credits" when requiring network upgrades.  These are not as valuable to Enron 
because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesn't 
have a "reservation" for the transmission.  The Eastern interconnection is 
prone to curtailments of transmission called "TLRs," especially in the 
summer.  The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission.

In order to sell power to the grid, the plant must apply to FERC for "Exempt 
Wholesale Generator" (EWG) status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer 
license with "Market Based Rates."  These filings make the on-site generator 
a "utility" for FERC purposes and subjects the "power marketer" to periodic 
filings at FERC.  These generally must be filed at least 60 days before the 
plant will start producing any power.  The filings take several weeks to 
prepare.

Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant.  The plant 
may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market.  EPMI has the 
FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and 
NEPOOL, but EPMI cannot, at this time, sell in other areas (absent a FERC 
filing and setting up an OASIS web page).  Be aware that many utilities add 
language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to "take" the 
ancillary services from your plant, without compensation.

If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant on-site, additional 
issues are involved.  You can check on the Enron home page under "Sites", 
"Intranet", "Government Affairs", "State Restructuring Reports" for 
information on the status of retail open access in that state.  If you need 
additional assistance, contact Elizabeth Linnell 33896.  

Generally, the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell 
power to a plant.  In order for an on-site plant to sell power to the grid,  
it must apply to FERC for "Exempt Wholesale Generator" (EWG) status and also 
obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with "Market Based Rates."  These 
filings make the on-site generator a "utility" for FERC purposes and subject 
the "power marketer" to periodic filings at FERC.  Because some industrials 
may not want to be FERC regulated, ENA may be able to use a "Special Purpose 
Vehicle" (SPV) so that ENA may own part of the generator.  There are also 
options to establish a "Qualified Facility" (QF) that sells power to the 
interconnected utility.  The interconnected utility may also have a program 
in which it purchases excess power from the on-site plant.  Please contact 
Bob Frank 33180 for help on possible regulatory structures.

There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line, 
such as a 69kv or 138kv.  Some utilties have filed to put these lines into 
their distribution systems, rather than in the wholesale transmission system, 
which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes.  We have 
not fully examined this type of situation, but can if necessary.

There are other regulatory issues, such as site permitting, political 
assistance, environmental permits, that must also be addressed.  The regional 
regulatory people in Rick Shapiro's government affairs group can assist you.

Hello Tracy,

I will need you to provide each of these person's corp user ID.  Once I have that, I will get this request taken care of.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
RY

Kay,

Attached is a form of a reimburseble contract that can be used for the Coop

starting point.  I understand you will try to conform it with David Lund's 
term sheet.  After you have done so, please distribute it back to us for 
review  before you send it to the client, per our phone conversation.  You 
will appreicate that I 'm still reserving my comments on the contract since I 
have yet to actually read it.

As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=

August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=

commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the=
=20
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of=20
August 8th less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge. =20
Enron=01,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corpora=

e=20
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, =
we=20
can easily surpass these goals.=20

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=
%=20
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has=20
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the=
=20
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a=20
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this yea=
r=20
than last year.  Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensate=
d=20
with generous options and bonus program, I encourage each of you to become =
a=20
member of the "Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of=
=20
your annual salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your=20
pledge this year, regardless of your level of giving last year.
=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=
=20
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across=
=20
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=

regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our=20
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your=20
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our=20
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and=20

Mary,

I've attached the latest draft, which has not yet been sent to the other 
side, and which includes a provision not yet agreed by ESA or negotiated with 
EECC (Clause 1(c)).  The schedule 1, which you care about, should reflect the 
changes you and I discussed with Jeff last week.  SInce this draft is not an 
agreed one, will you delete it after you review it, and if you are not ok 
with all the changes, let me know so I can include them when we finalize this 
tomorrow (Wed).  I will include you on the final negotiated draft tomorrow 
when I (or Glauco) send it out for final approval.

Dave

Can you please send it to me.  Thanks.

ESA and EECC teams,

This email is in response to John Rigby's fax of 28 Sep with comments to
the Preliminary Engineering Release Agreement.

I am OK with all of John and Scott's proposed changes except the rider to
replace paragraph 1(c), which deals with who has the risk/gatekeeper role
on deciding whether an activity is "hard cost" or not.  While I would
prefer to keep a "Contractor shall not perform any "hard cost" activity"
-type prohibition in the contract, I understand that since financing is
really an Owner issue, and Owner wants off-balance sheet financing, making
sure no "hard cost" activity is performed is really an Owner issue.  Thus,
I have taken their basic language/concept and modified it somewhat.

I have marked up EECC's proposed rider and attached the marked copy for
your review.  If acceptable to the owner team, I will forward it to EECC
for their review/approval.  Once we have agreement on this language, the
Preliminary Eng Release Agmt should be done and ready for John Novak's
review and approval and subsequent execution by ESA and EECC.

Darrell:

Per your request, for further requirements of ENA, attached is the most 
recent off balance sheet (West LB) turbine purchase contract executed between 
EECC and GE.  Although it includes guarantees for a steam turbine also, this 
language can be easily removed.  There are currently a handfull of provisions 
that both EECC and ENA legal, commercial and technical representatives are 
negotiating achieve broad based acceptability under the guidance of Sheila 
Tweed, that GE and Enron both will insist be incorporated into the future 
agreements.  The majority of the provisions in this contract will require 
little or no modification for use in the purchase of a gas turbine for a U.S. 
based project.  The portion of the executed contract that is not attached, 
and is arguably the most important, is the equipment specification.  Although 
a fairly standardized, abridged specification, the detailed project specific 
requirements are provide the level of clarity that is essential to 
understanding the scope to be supplied and integral to the guaranteed 
performance required in the Contract.  This docuement is currently drafted in 
WordPerfect, but is to be issued in Word going forward.   If you have 
questions or require assistance, please let me know.

The attached is a pretty decent summary of the recent U.S. Supreme Court's 
opinion on the Clean Water Act's juridictional reach to isolated waters.   
Thought it might be of interest to origination/developer type lawyers.

		 Subject: Analysis of the Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 SWANCC Decision


Attached is a brief memo prepared by Van Ness Feldman analyzing the U.S. 
Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 decision in the case of Solid Waste Agency of 
Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (No. 99-1178 (U.S. 
January 9, 2001)).  By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court determined that "isolated" 
waters (often wetlands) are not subject to regulation under the Clean Water 
Act (and the Section 404 permitting program).  This decision has significant 
implications for anyone who is, or will be engaging in the construction of 
generating facilities, transmission lines, factories, houses, pipelines, or 
similar projects.

Van Ness Feldman will be providing our friends and clients with periodic 
updates on breaking legal and legislative activity throughout the remainder 
of 2001.  If you would like to be removed from this distribution list, please

Elizabeth:

Following up on our conversations late last week, I reviewed the initial 
research undertaken by one of our junior associates dealing with the 
fiduciary duty issues in the context of a power marketing arrangement entered 
into by ECT to market the output of another party's ("Counterparty's) 
merchant power plants.  My general thoughts are as follows:

1.  Significance of Parties' Business and Economic Arrangements.  As you 
know, the precise nature of the business and economic relationship between 
ECT and Counterparty likely will affect the legal analysis; thus, it will be 
necessary to keep a close on that issue as the negotiations proceed.  It 
would appear that ECT generally would press for an agency relationship since 
the law is somewhat more favorable with respect to the ability to carve out 
areas where the agent does not owe a fiduciary duty to its principal.  
However, depending on the business and economic negotiations, there may 
ultimately be some risk that ECT could be deemed to be in a "partner" role 
vis-a-vis the Counterparty.  We assume, for example, that ECT would possess 
the power to bind the Counterparty to power sales contracts with third 
parties (subject, most likely, to specified parameters), at least with 
respect to spot market type deals.  (This likely will be the case even if the 
Counterparty has the right to terminate the agreement at anytime -- which 
termination effectively would be prospective in nature since any existing 
deals would continue to binding on Counterparty).  The risk of deemed partner 
status probably will exist regardless of whether the governing agreement 
specifically provides that the arrangement is not intended to create a 
partnership.

A further indicia of partner status would be if ECT's compensation is tied to 
net profits, particularly if ECT also shared in losses to some extent (e.g., 
perhaps in the nature of an overall "netting" or "tracking" account pursuant 
to which, for example, profits previously paid out to ECT would be recaptured 
with future losses (but never go below zero)).  Another factor running in 
favor of partner status will be the length of the agreement; a longer 
agreement often suggests more of a partnership arrangement.

2.    The Choice of Governing Law may be Significant.  For example, in states 
that have adopted the Uniform Partnership Act ("UPA") (e.g., New York, 
Delaware, Pennsylvania), there is more of a concern that a court would impose 
a higher fiduciary duty standard on ECT.  This result is less likely in 
states that have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act ("RUPA") (20 
states, including Texas, California and Montana), pursuant to which the 
parties can exclude specific categories of activities that are not subject to 
the partner's fiduciary duty obligation (if the carve outs are not manifestly 
unreasonable).  Although ECT presumably will always take the position that it 
is not a partner of Counterparty, in analyzing these issues, ECT should try 
to apply those tougher standards to its relationship in the event a court 
ever determined that those standards should apply.  The bottom line may be 
that the definitive agreements will need to specifically state that the 
parties recognize that ECT is in the business of buying and selling power and 
that it will be in competition with Counterparty, ECT is not obligated to 
bring Counterparty the best deals, Counterparty can terminate if it is 
dissatisfied, etc.  It will be advisable to list specific activities where it 
is clear ECT and Counterparty may be in competition, rather than rely on a 
general waiver of fiduciary duties; the courts clearly do not like advance 
disclaimers of all fiduciary duties (particularly where, like here, the 
arrangement is likely to be an exclusive one). Where ECT will need to be 
particularly careful will be with respect to ensuring against the use of 
confidential information from the Counterparty and its facilities in its 
stand alone power trading operations.

3.  Other Considerations.  One additional consideration to keep in mind.  The 
potential Counterparty you mentioned on the phone intends to project finance, 
on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis, many of the plants it proposes to 
acquire.  Like any merchant plant financing arrangement that is being put in 
place in today's "deregulating" power markets, the project lender will be 
very involved in any arrangement dealing with the marketing of the power from 
those plants since, obviously, that is the source of repayment for their 
loan.  The lender(s) could drive, for example, such items as the governing 
law for the definitive agreements, the term of the agreement, etc.  In 
addition, the lender will be very interested in any economic arrangement that 
could result in "performance" or similar types of bonuses being payable by 
the Counterparty to the agent, as well as any "clawback" of previously paid 
amounts in the event of subsequently incurred negative results.  In one 
similar arrangement with which have been involved, the lender has been very 
active in the negotiations of a similar type of agreement.  My guess is that 
undoubtedly will be the case in the situation you raised.  Thus, ECT's 
commercial negotiators likely will be encountering multiple parties "on the 
other side."

4.  PECO/Great Bay Dispute.  I put on the fax to you again another copy of 
the previous summary I had put together on the PECO/Great Bay contract 
dispute for your quick reference.  As we discussed, there are a number of 
provisions in that contract that ECT's originators would find of interest 
from a commercial perspective  -- with the clear caveat that some of them 
obviously are what lead to the litigation.  The allegations in the complaint 
clearly are, to some extent, of the fiduciary duty type (implied covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing).  Interestingly, there is a lack of language in 
that agreement trying to carve out PECO's obligations to Great Bay with 
respect to PECO's own trading operations.

I hope the foregoing is at least somewhat useful to you, although the "rules" 
in this area are fairly blurry.  Please call me if you have any questions.

John

To pull equipment out of West LB 3 things need to get done:
1.  A Notice needs to be sent to West LB letting them know when you intend to 
exercise your purchase option, and on what equipment (5 days before you 
exercise).
2.  A Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed 
by Mike Miller or Janet Dietrich and a West LB executive.
3.  A wire needs to be sent to West LB paying them for the equipment

The Notice is just a letter informing them of the DATE on which you intend to 
exercise your purchase option and the DESCRIPTION of the equipment.  I'm 
attaching Austin's Notice. 


I'm also attaching the Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement we 
used for Austin.  I filled in schedule 1 with the unallocated equipment 
details (please double-check the info).  The document needs to be circulated 
among ENA legal, Finance legal, Rob Taylor (our outside counsel), and Tim 
Oxley (West LB's counsel).  Let me know when you want to proceed and I'll 
send it out to everyone for initial comments.

Call me with any questions.

Most of the current interconnection agreements contain language requiring a 
tax gross up and, possibly, purchase of the utility's preferred meter (with 
the utility to own the meter.)  

First, there may be possible structures to minimize the tax gross up for 
contributions in aid of construction (CIAC).  Contact ENA tax counsel when 
working on these deals. 

Second, Enron pipelines have allowed the customer to purchase and own its own 
metering equipment, as long as such equipment meets the pipeline 
requirements.  This would have tax gross up implications because the utility 
would own less equipment.  Let me know if a utility is requiring metering 
equipment and we would rather use and own our own equipment.

Thanks.

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to 
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC 
licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF 
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In 
most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their 
primary business is as a utility, like Enron).  

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform 
certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site 
generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let 
you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Subject: Entities that do not need power marketing authorization


Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or 
municipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing 
authorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the 
Federal Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, 
which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in 
interstate commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United 
States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, 
authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any 
corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more 
of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing 
acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision 
makes specific reference thereto."

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to have 
rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to state 
agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are 
exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most 
provisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilities 
making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file 
rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which 
authorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided 
cost.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at 
market-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, 
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a 
market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF 
status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Attached are the execution copies of the Turbo Park documents that are 
relevant to power plant equipment procurement and development.   I have asked 
Finance to provide us with summaries of the relevant provisions since the 
120+ page Participation Agreement, which is largely a loan agreement, is very 
complex.  I will nevertheless attempt to summarize the "process" of getting 
into and out of TurboPark.  In the meantime, please familiarize yourselves 
with the documents.

The draft form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for the GE LM6000 
turbines from LV Cogen II to Lauren-Saulsbury is attached.  This form has 
been agreed to by Lauren, but remains subject to approval by GE.

The assignment and assumption for the ABB transformers will be substantially 
the same as this form.  The agreements for the OTSG and STG will have fewer 
"Excluded Obligations" since Lauren will be responsible for payment and any 
shipping not included in the purchase price for those units.  

As with the GE contract, vendor approval for the form of assignment and 
assumption of the remaining equipment items is required and is being worked 
on.

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Thank you for an overwhelming response to participate in ClickAtHome's Second 
Pilot.    For those of you who have signed up, we are excited to have you in 
this pilot.  We look forward to you testing our process and services and 
giving us feedback!

In order to be eligible for Pilot 2, you must first read and agree to the 
Pilot Participant Agreement and then respond to the 
ClickAtHomePilot2@enron.com email box with the following statement:    "I 
accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement." with 
the Pilot agreement attached.

Once we have received your acceptance,  you will be eligible and confirmed 
for Pilot 2.

Those who are confirmed for Pilot 2 will receive an email the week of 
November 13th on how and when they can access the ordering website.  Until 
that point,  the website will not be accessible.

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on the website.  We would like 
you to review more details about out-of-pocket costs once the pilot website 
is available.  After agreeing to the Pilot Participants Agreement and 
reviewing these materials on the website, you may choose to defer ordering 
until the All Employee roll-out in early 2001 if you wish.


Thanks!
