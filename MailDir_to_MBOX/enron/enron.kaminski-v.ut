Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Thanks,
Ehud Ronn

I think full time employment starting in about six months seems to be the
best option.  It is probably best to get my dissertation wrapped up before
taking on additional commitments.

Zeigham,

We discussed two options (not necessarily mutually exclusive):

1. summer internship
2. full employment.

Are you interested exclusively in full employment?

I need the answer ASAP, as we are going to discuss the additional summer
intern positions this afternoon.

Vince:
It was very nice talking to you at  the Texas Finance Festival and I think
the telecom market that Enron is entering  is very interesting and very
lucrative. I would be very interested in  working in that segment for
Enron.

However, I talked to Sheridan about  this oppurtunity and he said that it
is probably going to be another six months  before I finish my
dissertation. So while I am definitely interested, the  start date will
probably have to be around that time.

At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again  and hopefully once I have
defended my dissertation we can discuss  employment oppurtunities in
greater detail.

Ehud,

We shall make  reservations for dinner at Vincent's
on West Dallas (2701 West Dallas, 713 528 4313).
We shall make reservations fro 7:00 p.m.
You can call me on my cell phone (713 410 5396) if there is a problem.

We shall have about 25-30 people at the meeting on Thu at

See you tomorrow.

Vince,

Greetings, and thanks for your 6/12 e-mail.

>We can meet for dinner on the 21st. Then you can visit with us on the 22nd
>in the morning and have individual meetings. At 11:30 you can meet the
>entire
>Research Group at our weekly lunch meeting. We can continue
>individual meetings in the afternoon.
I thank you once again for your invitation and look forward to my visit
this Wed.  My current schedule calls for a Hobby arrival on Wed. at 6:23
p.m., in time for the dinner scheduled for that evening.  (I can take a cab
directly to the restaurant if you're scheduling a circa 6:45 - 7 p.m.
dinner.)  Further, I have tentatively set up the Thur. return flight to
Austin at 3:38 p.m., and that can be modified as desired.

>Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree
>Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).
When I made the room reservation last Mon. 6/12, it turned out that these
hotels showed no vacancy (is there a conference in town?), so the nearest I
could obtain is the Hilton Houston Plaza (6633 Travis) some 3.5 miles away
from Enron.  (If it is important that I stay at the closer hotels, Shirley
might ascertain whether Enron's travel agent can obtain a room there.)

I take this opportunity to request of Shirley that, subject to your
approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available
for the room where the 11:30 luncheon meeting takes place.  Also, since I
would like each participant to have his/her own copy, I would ask her to
advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend, or
alternatively, Shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when I
bring the "master" copy in Thur. morn.

I look forward to seeing you Wed. and Thur.  Best Regards,
Ehud

Vince,

Good morning.

As you may know, last Thur. Enron honored this year's recipients of the
Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars at a dinner in Austin.  In addition to
the three recipients, Business School Dean May and several of my
colleagues, Enron attendees included Sally Beck, Cindy Justice, Karen
Marshall (newly-appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives for
Enron Community Relations Dept.) and Rick Causey.

I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
current Enron/UT issues with Rick:
I.  Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling
II.  UT Participation in EnronTraining Activities
Per my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussion
with an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.

I.  With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:

1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)
are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.
or early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,
Real options, and International/globalization.
2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.
evening, then continue all day Fri.
3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,
structure, participation and content.
4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,
in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to
be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.

II.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT
partcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.
analysts and associates.  Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning a
specific set of issues -- "Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets"
-- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
presentation at Enron.  FYI, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
end of this e-mail.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your UT visit on 10/11.  Best,
Ehud

Vince, Jeff has decided to decline this speaking opportunity.  He is 
scheduled to speak at a Leadership conference at UT on 2/16, so given his 
time limitations, he wants to pass on this one.  Sorry to be the messenger of 
bad news.  SRS

I just wanted to check with you regarding the consulting arrangement we
discussed a couple of weeks ago.

Perhaps, we should start with just a 1 or 2 day contract where I give some
thoughts to the kind of issues that we discussed and come to Houston to
present my preliminary thoughts and possible avenues for additional work.

Happy New Year! Hope you all had a wonderful holiday season.

On behalf of the University of Texas Finance Department and CEFER, we
would
like to cordially invite you to attend our:

2001 Energy Finance Conference
Austin, Texas
February 22 - 23, 2001
Hosted by the University of Texas Finance Department
Center for Energy Finance Education and Research

Dr. Ehud I. Ronn and Dr. Sheridan Titman are currently in the process of
finalizing the details of the conference agenda.  We have listed the
agenda
outline below to assist you in your travel planning.  Each conference

speakers
on the designated topic.

As supporters of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research,

Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Thanks,
Ehud Ronn

I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available

?
Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all.? Let me 
know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.? 
All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.

Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk  at UT this fall?and look

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

How are you doing?

I called you on May 11th about my first rotational assignment.  You
recommended Risk Management and asked me to email you my resume.

It seems like Risk Management Group are not very interested in me,
because
I
haven't received any feedback from them yet.  Do you think I should wait
for
a few days or call them?

I do appreciate your help, which will make a difference on my career
path.

Dear Vince:

I received the contract you faxed today.  I think the changes look ok, but
it needs to be approved by the university lawyers.  The following is a
letter I sent to Traci regarding our broadband conversation.  This was also
sent to your Enron email address but it bounced back.

regards,

Sheridan

Dear Traci:

Thank you for the information about Enron Broadband services.  I have
contacted Bob May, the Dean of the UT business school, the two Associate
Deans in charge of program development and
George Gau, my department chairman.  I will try to set up a meeting with
them next week to discuss our current distant learning initiatives and the
potential for collaborating with Enron.

Please let me know if you have any materials that I should show them at the
meeting.

I'll let you know what develops.  We view Enron as one of our most
important strategic partners and if we are considering offering courses
over the internet I'm sure that our Dean will want to discuss this with you
further.

regards,

Sheridan

Vince,

 Thanks again for coming to Austin to speak with my class.  I am sure
that they appreciated hearing about the use of real options at Enron, and I
think it was a very fine way to finish the semester.

 Along with my colleagues from finance, I appreciate the strong
support that Enron has provided to the College of Business Administration.
We appreciate the relationship, and look forward to seeing you in Austin
again next year.

 Jim

Dear Vince:

 I have now spent 16 hours on the valuation project and wanted to touch
base with you to make sure that the basic approach makes sense and that you
think we are making an appropriate amount of progress.  My invoice is
attached.

 By the way, John Martin just mentioned that you have agreed to be our
luncheon speaker at the Texas Finance Festival.  I really appreciate your
help on this and would like to schedule some time next week to talk about
it in more detail.

 I look forward to hearing from you.

regards,

Sheridan

Hello all,

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between
Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about
this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Sheridan,

I got your E-mail regarding the credit spread model. I have already passed it
to our corporate lawyers and, as I know from experience, they will sit on it
for some time. I may have an update on Monday when I return to the office (I
am in the New York area through Friday).

I talked briefly with my colleagues about the project but we have not
discussed the specifics. I shall call you on Monday morning before the
conference call to give you some information on what other universities are
doing in the area  of distance learning (you probably know about most
important initiatives in this field). The conference call will include Brad
Nabergall who is designing new products for our broadband business. I
mentioned to him the possibility of UT offering executive education energy
finance related courses over the Internet. I also mentioned that we should
explore the option of offering MBA courses over the Internet, assuming that
UT would be interested in being a content provider.

Rick,

I asked Greg Whalley and he declined (he has a speaking
engagement in London  a day before).

I have sent an invitation to Louise Kitchen and she has not 
replied yet. I  shall catch her at the management conference in San Antonio 
and
ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well.

Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

 ---------oOOo-----oOOo----------

Ehud,

I am flying back in the evening and dinner would be difficult.
I shall be glad to join you for lunch,

Shirley, as I understand gave you my requirements for the AV.

My flight arrives at 8:30 a.m. I can meet you at your office in the morning 
and 
we can talk about the conference and other issues.

Vince,

Good morning.

Further to your forthcoming visit this Wed., I write to clarify last-minute
details:

1.  Your ETA/ETD.  Will you be available to join us for lunch and/or dinner?

2.  Your AV requirements, if any.  Should you need either, we have an
overhead projector as well as laptop capability (either YOUR laptop, or we
can with advance notice reserve a laptop if you bring floppies).

BTW, any developments re Jeff Skilling's 2/22 conference keynote?

Best,

Vince,

Greetings.

I write at this time to follow up on your kind intercession on our behalf
with Jeff Skilling's office regarding his participation in our Spring
Conference.  We have secured hotel rooms at the Radisson Hotel, will
shortly have to provide a guarantee on those rooms, and would therefore
like to ascertain his participation as keynote speaker the evening of Thur.
2/22.

Hope all is well.  See you Oct. 11th, if not sooner.  Best,
Ehud

Vince,

I have received the full-time offer package from Associate & Analyst Program
last week. Apparently they have pretty tight deadlines. Because of a certain
clause in the contract, I may have to give them an answer by October 16th.
Since we discussed this before I left Enron, I felt it would be a good idea
to inform you of the recent developments.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding both part-time and
full-time employment opportunities with the Research Group.

Best,

Mulong,

We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away.
Please look at the last winter and the winter of
95/96.

We shall prepare for you the electricity price
information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but
you have to approach FT (the publishers of
Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price
index we recommend using)  and request the permision
to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute
this information.

Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that
we can produce the time series for you,
conditional on the permission from the publishers
of Megawatts Daily.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Louise,

Would you consider being a keynote speaker at this conference (Feb 22 
evening)?

The conference will be held in Austin.

We have a very good relationship with UT and we are helping them to organize 
this conference.

I shall be glad to provide you more information about the event.

Vince,

As promised, enclosed please find a brief description of the proposed Feb.
22 - 23 Energy Finance Conference, suitable for dissemination to your
colleagues:

"As Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research
(CEFER), my colleagues and I are planning a practitioner-industry
Conference in Spring 2001, Feb. 22 - 23, to discuss four topics:  Risk
management, Deregulation, Real options, and International/globalization.
Other than the Univ. of Texas participants and selected academics from
other institutions, we expect most participants at the Conference to be
energy practitioners from Houston.  The Conference will begin with a dinner
and address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri."

Given the energy-finance focus of the Conference, do you believe the
Networks topics is sufficiently energy-related?

Best,
Ehud

Ehud,

Best holiday wishes to you and your family. 

I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference

I have approached a number of executives at Enron. Greg Whalley speaks in 
London a day
before. Louise Kitchen, the mother  of EnronOnline will ski (this is the week
of school holidays in England and her family will come here). 

One suggestion I want to make is Rick Causey. I talked to him and he is 
willing to
be a speaker. He is a very senior and important executive of Enron and a UT 
grad.

Any thoughts?

Vince

Elena,

Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. 
We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.
 
We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has to obtain 
permission from FT (Megawatts Daily). I shall cc you on my msg to him.

I wanted to make sure we coordianted our efforts with you. 

Below are a few key UT recruiting dates. Ideally, we would like for your 
presentation to occur a week or so before our interview list is due to the 
Career Services Office. This will allow for additional candidates to submit 
their resumes for our review before we turn in the interview list.

Wed., Sept. 13 - Corporate Presentation & Reception - Alumni Center
Fri., Sept. 22 - Eye's of Texas Career Fair - Campus
Thurs., Sept. 28 - Enron Interview List due to Career Services Office
Wed., Oct. 11 - Pre-interview Reception - selected candidates only
Thurs., Oct. 12 - First Round Interviews
Fri., Oct. 13 - Second Round Interviews
Sat., Oct. 28 - Super Saturday for UT Candidates

Please let me know what works best with your schedule. Note that October 11 
is the same date as our pre-interview reception.

We look forward to working with you on this.

Thanks,

Celeste,

Greetings.

As you may recall, I am the Director of the Univ. of Texas Center for
Energy Finance (CEFER).  I would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague Vince Kaminski's annual presentation to the UT Foundations
of Energy Finance class which I will be presenting as usual the first half
of the Fall Semester.

Thus, to begin, I wonder whether either the above is your current e-mail
account, and, with the departure of Meryl Barnett (with whom I believe we
coordinated this in the past), whether this is an issue within your scope.

With respect to this reception, I appreciate that there may be other Enron
receptions scheduled for this Fall.  However, if you so choose, I would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an Enron reception
following Vince's presentation.  If you would indeed like to do so, I
suggest we coordinate with Vince the date for the presentation/reception.

Sincerely,
Ehud

I think he can do it, Vince, but UT has asked him to speak at a Leadership 
conference also on 2/16, which Rick Causey is encouraging him to do.  He has 
all the information (I just sent it home in his mail as he returned this 
afternoon from a week of travel), so will press him to make a decision 
tomorrow.  He may decide to do both or one or the other...I'll let you know 
as soon as I do.  SRS

Cindy,

Yes, it's just around the corner and we have our very best program ever.
Our web site is up at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

check it out.  Actually, I was waiting for the final version of the program
from Sheridan to post it before getting in touch with you this week.  We
are planning on a room capacity group of 45-50 folks and are finalizing the
plans for entertainment for Friday and Saturday night on the riverwalk.
Bill is handling the arrangements this year and I'll pass this message on
to him as well.

Do you think we could get an Enron speaker for Saturday's luncheon?  Last
year was fabulous and would be hard to top but we'd like to try.  San
Antonio should be a bit easier on the speaker too.  Let me know what your
thoughts are on everything including the speaker.

Bill and I are leaving town Wed afternoon to go to a Harvard conference so
maybe we could talk before then.

We're getting excited and want to get you guys involved for it is your
personal (and financial) support that makes the conference really work.

Your student has raised some difficult questions.  I would recommend Ehud,
but I thought that the finance people have the answers in cases with
complete markets and that we rely on the decision science people for cases
with incomplete markets.

If it would help, I can come in at 6pm after my class in a couple of weeks.

Sheridan,

 See the comments below.  I don't mean to put you on the spot, and
have not announced anything in class, but I am hoping that you could visit
my class for about an hour one Thursday afternoon to discuss your views
regarding applications of option pricing concepts to "real options".  As a
reminder, I've attached a course outline.  Chris Kenyon from Schlumberger is
speaking on April 13, and Vince Kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on
April 20.

 I am going to be out of town on April 27, so that leaves either next
Thursday (April 6) or May 4.  Would either of those times work for you?  I'm
not thinking of any preparation, but more of an informal discussion of the
"philosophical issues" related to real options work.

Josh,

 Some very thoughtful observations.  As you know, I had invited one
finance professor to our class on Arundel, but he was out of town.  I do
plan to invite Sheridan Titman to discuss the issue of using the option
models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded.
I do think it is important to face that issue, which is actually covered at
a theoretical level in our last couple of readings.

 The issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further
discussion, as you suggest.  So far, we've been looking at cases where
volatility is "given".  The problem of finding an "objective" measure of
volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct
risk adjusted discount rate, which is not surprising since the concepts are
almost two sides of the same plate.  One approach, of course, is to do some
modeling using traditional decision analysis tools, including subjective
probabilities, but the finance people who write options articles don't like
to think  about such ideas.

 I'll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester
continues.  I think it was important to surface some of these points early,
and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a
naive sort of way.

 Thanks for the feedback and comments.

 Jim

Subject: Real Options Course Feedback




After overcoming the initial (I hope) overload of materials and tools
presented
thus far in the semester, it appears to me that you are achieving the
objective
of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety
of
problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded
financial elements.

As a constructive feedback, you have been forthright with us in marking off
areas of this subject which are still controversial.  I also realize that
rightly so, real-world application of this type of analysis without a robust
understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions
that
result in a "house of cards" effect.  My opinion at this point is that two
issues are of potentially "make-or-brake" importance if I am to persuade my
superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of
projects
whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by
financial
instruments.  These issues are easy to guess:

1)  Discounting and Risk Free rates:  I do not sense that anyone in the
class
has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time
value
questions in the absence of liquidity.  Is there someone within the finance
department that can present a firmer position on this question?

2)  Volatility: I found Winston's examples on this metric succinct.  I would
recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this
subject.  My criticism again relates to messy problems.  I anticipate
arguments
against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility
measures.
If I were a conservative financial manager, I would argue that:

*** Two-a: implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of
equity
options is a shotgun approach -- the projects being valued are of a tranche
which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the
weighted average measured by the equities utilized.  Oil, gas and electricty
are
good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of
the
value chain. Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata,
but
what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a
vertically integrated company?

*** Two-b: based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is
being
proposed for a new business venture (some new unexploited opportunity,)
there is
some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new
ventures and the high risk of failure.  This skepticism is likely to be less
acute in high-tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded
before us daily by NASDQ touts.  It is a much harder sell to "mature"
industries.

Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around
opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas
sectors
as regulation is removed.  A large proportion of the risk is embedded in
ongoing
changes of public policy on an international basis.  As an intentionally
screwed-up example, can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses
volatility for U.S. companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based on
speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility (CFE) and
PEMEX?

Vince,

Greetings.

1.  Thanks again for hosting the dinner at Power 2000.  Congratulations
also on a thoughtful keynote address, a copy of which I picked up on the
way out of the Conference.

2.  My family and I are leaving on a family trip 5/25 thru 6/4.  Thus, I
would like to reschedule my proposed Houston visit, and presentation of the
"Enterprise-Wide Risk Management" model to Enron's Research Dept., to the
next mutually-convenient date.

Best,
Ehud

Dear Vince:

I spoke with Ms Crenshaw yesterday afternoon about a conference call about
developing internet course material.   If you have already discussed this
with your colleagues, it might be helpful if you could very briefly outline
the questions and issues they might raise in the conference call so that I
can be a bit better prepared.

Ms Crenshaw also mentioned that you never received my earlier email
regarding the credit spread model I developed with Stathis and Sergey.  My
earlier email follows, and the nondisclosure agreement is attached.

I look forward to talking with you next week.

regards,

Sheridan

As to when I can start, I think I can start around the end of May. I can
give you a more precise date after I figure out the schedule regarding my
assistanship obligations.

PS: Could you give some idea about the kind of projects that we'll be
working on? I might do some advance reading if you could point out some

I have ordered a flip chart and markers and an overhead projector.  

There were 11 pages in your presentation and they look fine.  We have

I believe everything is set - if you think of anything else, please let me

Enjoy your dinner tonight and we will see you tomorrow.

There is one additional item I would request:  If the room does not contain

I am faxing you my Presentation Handout for tomorrow.  I would be grateful
if your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow's 11:30 a.m.
meeting; Vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30
range.  I will also bring along a "master copy" in case the trasmission
unduly mangles the fax.

Vincent,

 We met last year when you were visiting The University, and talking
primarily with our finance faculty.  As you may have heard, I tried to call
to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real
options from your group at Enron.  Naturally, I would be delighted if you
could speak, but I could also appreciate the possibility that someone else
might also be a good choice.

  I have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information.
This is the first time this course has been offered at UT, and I was
motivated to do so because of the "buzz" regarding the topic in industry.  I
have about 30 MBA students in the class, many of whom were in the energy
finance classes offered by Sheridan Titman and Ehud Ronn (both of whom have
been very supportive of the development of this class).  My own background
is decision analysis rather than finance, so I tend to approach the topic
with that perspective.  As you can see, I have covered both traditional
decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature.  At the
present time, I don't think there is a really complete textbook that fits
the course at the MBA level, so I've tried to focus on how to do things in
practice, and have provided software (DPL, spreadsheets, @Risk, etc) as
tools for the students to use.

 The course is scheduled on Thursday afternoons from 3:30 to 6:30,
which is a time that I chose to make possible the participation of some
Executive MBA students from Houston (3 are participating).  I look forward
to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker, or any other
suggestions that you might have.

Vince,

 If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business
building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the
business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the
main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the
second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are
found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the
building.

 If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from
most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and
will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let
me know if you have any other questions.

 Jim

Jim,

I can  take a cab or get a rental car from the airport  (thanks for your
kind offer).
I shall appreciate, however, if you could drop me off at the hotel before
dinner.

The time allocation for my speech is about right. I think I shall need
about 90
minutes.

Please let me know where we can meet on Thursday.  I shall be at an
off-site
on Wednesday but you can reach me on my cell phone (713 410 5396)
and by sending a cc message to my AOL address: vkaminski@aol.com.

I  look forward to meeting you.

Vince,

     I could pick you up at the airport, or you could rent a car and come
to campus.  I have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11:30 and 12:00, and then you would have some time to
visit with Sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class.

     Sheridan and a guest speaker from his class, Suresh Sundaresan from
Columbia, will be joining us for dinner.  I could provide transportation to
your hotel, and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative.

     I will have a PC available in the classroom, with Office 2000 and
windows NT.  You could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine,
if that's most convenient.  You could simply email the presentation, and I
would have it for you if you prefer.

     How much time would you like?  I would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options, and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
(which
is required for all classes).  At some point, we should take a brief break,
so that would leave approximately 1.5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility.  Otherwise, I could take up the "slack".

     I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

     Jim

Vince,

     I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after
his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute "panel discussion" with the students on
issues related to real options in practice.l

     I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan
lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

     I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to
hearing from you.

Networks topics is sufficiently energy-related?

Per my above concern, I'd like to discuss the matter with you further.

Many thanks for your e-mail.

>What about June 22?  I have several trips in between May 25 and June 22.
I thank you for the invitation.  May I at this time acquire an "option" to
visit on that date, with the finalization of the visit's timing to be
completed early next month?

Thanks and Best Regards,

Julia,

I am sending you a copy of the nondisclosure agreement I received from a  
professor at UT
Austin. Three UT academics developed a model that may be useful in our pricing
applications. They envisage the possibility of either selling this model to 
Enron or of joint research 
effort in this area.

Can you, please, take a look at the attached legal document.

Vince

Dear Vince:

I spoke with Ms Crenshaw yesterday afternoon about a conference call about
developing internet course material.   If you have already discussed this
with your colleagues, it might be helpful if you could very briefly outline
the questions and issues they might raise in the conference call so that I
can be a bit better prepared.

Ms Crenshaw also mentioned that you never received my earlier email
regarding the credit spread model I developed with Stathis and Sergey.  My
earlier email follows, and the nondisclosure agreement is attached.

I look forward to talking with you next week.

regards,

Sheridan

Mulong,

We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away.
Please look at the last winter and the winter of
95/96.

We shall prepare for you the electricity price
information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but
you have to approach FT (the publishers of
Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price
index we recommend using)  and request the permision
to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute
this information.

Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that
we can produce the time series for you,
conditional on the permission from the publishers
of Megawatts Daily.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Mulong

Jim,

I am scheduled to arrive in Austin on May 4 at 10:32 a.m.
I shall be glad to join you and a group of your colleagues for lunch.
I am flying back to  Houston Friday morning and we can meet for dinner after
the class.

I shall have a Power Point presentation on my PC. I can also
prepare a set of transparencies if this is more convenient for you.

Vince,

 I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute "panel discussion" with the students on
issues related to real options in practice.l

 I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan
lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

 I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to
hearing from you.

We can meet for dinner on the 21st. Then you can visit with us on the 22nd
in the morning and have individual meetings. At 11:30 you can meet the entire 
Research Group at our weekly lunch meeting. We can continue
individual meetings in the afternoon.

Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree
Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).

Ehud,

Sorry I shall miss you on Thursday.

I shall definitely attend you presentation at Power 2000.

I shall ask about a guest accounton EOL. Typically, such an account allows
an outside user to take a look at the system, but I don't think the traders 
will allow
systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third 
party.

Risk-Management Optimization Model; 3. Enron On-Line


Vince,

Greetings.

I am following up at this time with respect to the above issues we
discussed in San Antonio.

1.  I am leaving Thur. morn for Philadelphia, and shall not be back until
late Fri.  (My ETD is 9:40 a.m., which I understand is less than an hour
before your arrival ...)  Thus I shall regrettably miss your current UT
visit, which we had hoped to also use as an opportunity to present/discuss
my enterprise-wide risk management model.

2.  That said, I shall be presenting an abridged version of this model at
Power 2000's first day, 5/9 4:15 - 4:55 p.m.  While I realize you'll be
very busy over Power 2000's two days, should your schedule permit, I should
most welcome the opportunity for you to see the model.

3.  Per your suggestion in San Antonio, I would like to take this
opportunity to inquire whether I might obtain an Enron On-Line account to
obtain electricity prices quoted by Enron.

I look forward to seeing you at Power 2000.  Best Regards,
Ehud

Subject: summer internship



Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

Subject: Re: Comments


Rakesh:

Thanks for your input.  They are quite useful for helping me clarify my own
thinking.  The following are my responses to your comments and
clarifications.  The **ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you.

1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear
if you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we
shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes
at that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of
nature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative
realization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk
capital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm
anymore.

** I agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement.  I do this
because I have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows, (this
is discussed in my first memo).  This clearly provides a conservative
estimate of firm value, and a measure of risk capital that is too high.
>From the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital,
it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the PV at each
node is positive.  Also, one might want to set the level so that the PV is
positive in say 98% of all nodes.


2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all
values being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a
project with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not
have a positive debt capacity.

**Again, this is a very conservative initial estimate.  When the model is
refined, you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project
defaults a certain percent of the time.

3.  It seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate, which is
obtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the
variances).  It is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such
an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence.

**I am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect
on volatility.  In fact, I think the process requires only one iteration
when the volatility is independent of the discount rate.  Again, the idea
is that we calculate the volatility of the project's value calculated with
an initial discount rate.  Using the calculated volatility and the stock of
a comparison firm, calculate a more appropriate discount rate.  If the
volatility of the project's value is not affected by the change in discount
rates then we are done.  If, however, the change in discount rates changes
volatility, then we may have to iterate.

Let me know if this makes sense.**

Also, our project has a finite life and the market-based assets will have
infinite lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant
variance?  Is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison
investment?

**This is a good point.  I was thinking in terms of the average variance,
but this may not be correct.  Actually, we know that this is just an
approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good
approximation.  Typically, firms tend to ignore issues relating to the
duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate,
which clearly does not make sense.  This requires some additional thought.**

4.  Finally, our criterion is to subtract from the average PV the
investment and also the risk capital.  Setting risk capital to zero, this
model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and
endogenously determines the discount rate.

**This is correct.  My goal was to come up with something that was closely
related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into
how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate.  There are a
number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure.  What we need
to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the
kind of projects that you are evaluating.**

Gas Field Case

To facilitate your thinking, we are providing a gas field example below.

We invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field.  A profile of
expected production and variance of the production per year is available
from the engineers at the beginning.  Production will be autocorrelated, as
the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being
more or less than the estimated reserves.   We assume the life of the field
to be 10 years with no salvage value.  There are fixed and variable
operating costs.  It might be useful for you to think about applying the
framework to this problem.

**This problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely
that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing.
Hence, there is no need to be concerned about risk capital (other than the
x million dollars to buy and develop the property).  To value the property
assuming all-equity financing we calculate the value process of the
developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment
whose value process is observable (e.g., a traded MLP).  The risk-adjusted
return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash
flows of the gas field.

Please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and
calculating the risk-adjusted return on the comparison investment is not
necessarily straightforward. **

Let me know when you would like to discuss this.

********************************

On another topic, is it possible for you to give me information about one
case where Enron bought or sold a base load power plant, where the
purchaser financed the transaction with non-recourse debt.  We would like
the following information:

1. The value of the power plant (or purchase price)

2. The amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract.

3.  Some information about the pricing of gas-power swaps and options.

About a year ago I gave Vince a paper which develops a pricing model for
project debt.  I don't think he thought that it could be implemented on the
type of projects that Enron finances.  However, my coauthors would like to
try applying the model for one case study.

Let me know when you want to discuss these issues.

Hi Sheridan,

How are you?  I hope that you had a good vacation.  Vasant and I looked at 
your memo and found it to be interesting.    I shall first briefly summarize 
our understanding of the methodology you propose.  The comments follow.  
Finally, I shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case 
in further refining the model.

It appears that you are proposing a state-space approach where probabilities 
of different states at various future dates are specified.  The next step is 
to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the 
branches from the origin to one of the terminal points.  Traversing through 
the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the 
average present value of the project.  Also, you are using the simulation to 
assign a value of the project to each node.  Thus each node will have a cash 
flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value 
which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward.   If some 
of these values turn out to be negative, zero-coupon, risk-free bonds are 
purchased to neutralize the negative realization. 

Next, we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our 
project (based on the variance of the returns) .  We iterate until 
convergence.

Finally, we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital 
from the PV of the gross cash flows (including debt) to determine if the 
project merits further consideration.

Comments/Clarifications

1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear 
if you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we 
shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at 
that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of 
nature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative 
realization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk 
capital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm 
anymore.

2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all 
values being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a 
project with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not 
have a positive debt capacity.

obtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the

lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant variance?

Elena,

Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. 
We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.
 
We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has 
to obtain

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and

the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you

Zeigham,

We discussed two options (not necessarily mutually exclusive):

1. summer internship
2. full employment.

Are you interested exclusively in full employment?

I need the answer ASAP, as we are going to discuss the additional summer
intern positions this afternoon.

It was very nice talking to you at  the Texas Finance Festival and I think 
the telecom market that Enron is entering  is very interesting and very 
lucrative.? I would be very interested in  working in that segment for Enron.
?
However, I talked to Sheridan about  this oppurtunity and he said that it is 
probably going to be another six months  before I finish my dissertation.? So 
while I am definitely interested, the  start date will probably have to be 
around that time.?

At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again  and hopefully once I have

Vince, there was a trustees' meeting (during dinner) which I attended.
Here are a few things that were discussed there:

1. April 4th is the date when different companies representatives will come 
on UT campus to tell MBA
students about their companies and job opportunities. The companies will have 
to pay a small fee (about
$200) to be able to participate.

2. Trustees' continued support for in-class presentations, Finance Challenge 
program and practicums.
I understand that UT wants you to give some classes in the autumn semester 
for MBA students.

3. Some companies (like Reliant) select some well defined projects and give 
them to UT students to
work on for a few months. Students work in teams and discuss their progress 
with Ihud Ron and then
report results to the company.

Regards,

Tanya.

Dear Vince:

 I spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on
determining discount rates than I originally anticipated.  It is somewhat
surprising, but there really isn't much academic work that I am aware of
that addresses these issues.

Very briefly,

1. I think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk
capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate.

2. I think it is important to model Enron's opportunity cost of capital and
how that changes over time.  The liquidity of a project will affect its
value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital
changes over time.  There is also likely to be a relation between duration
and discount rates that depends on the factors generating Enron's
opportunity cost of capital.

3. I have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify
some of the issues that I have raised.

Please take a look at the attached document.  You might find this somewhat
confusing, so I will give you a call later in the week to discuss this.

Please let me know when you will be free.  I look forward to hearing from you.

regards,

Sheridan

Good afternoon Professors:

I am the Administrative Coordinator for the Enron Corp. Research Group.
Yannis Tzamouranis  spoke with Vince Kaminski about meeting with you to
discuss the development of a program for the U of H.

I understand from your email that you will be available Wednesday, May
24th.  If this is correct, and if Professors McCauley and Reiter will also be
available that date, we would like to schedule a meeting at 4:00 pm on the
24th of May at Vince Kaminski's Enron office.

If this is not acceptable, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Corp. Research Group

Professor Ronn:

Thank you for your email and I wish to respond as follows:

 I have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a
 hotel reservation closer into town.  I will let you know.

 I have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen
 installed.  However, there is really not room for a lectern.  The overhead 
will
 sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part
 of the table for their presentation copies.

 I will be glad to make copies for you, however, it would be a big help if you
 could email me a copy of your presentation on Wednesday.  Thursday
 mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have
 time to make the copies.

I hope this meets with your approval.  Please let me know if you need 
anything else.

We look forward to your visit.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
