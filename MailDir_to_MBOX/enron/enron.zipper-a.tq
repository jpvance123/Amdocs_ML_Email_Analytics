Andy,

Back on December 15, 2000 you received a letter from True Quote confirming
the redemption and forfeiture of 7,731,942 Common Units of Participation
owned by Enron Net Works LLC in True Quote LLC.  Part of that letter
contained the updated capital structure of True Quote LLC subsequent to the
redemption.  However, the equity owned by APB Energy, Inc. was inadvertently
left off that summary.  The current capital structure is, and should have
been described in that letter, as follows

	B2B Internet Capital Corp.	7,440,000	Series A Preferred Units
	EnFORM Technology LLC	   560,000	Series A Preferred Units
	APB Energy, Inc.		1,172,838	Common Units
	PG&E Energy Trading -
	  Gas Corporation	           15,000,000	Common Units
	Enron Net Works LLC		 7,268,058	Common Units
	Employee Stock Option
	  Plan				 1,000,000 	Common Units

If you have any questions about this, or any other matter, please don't
hesitate to contact me.

Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once "traction" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

Regards,
Todd A. Creek

Richard Tobia called to ask me to take a look at their screen as they felt they were gettign updates and a commercial manager should see the progress.  We were able to update prices at a speed of about 4 seconds.  We then attempted to send multiple updates at a speed of about 1 second per update.  True Quote was unable to accept the updates and the link was automatically diconnected by EnronOnline after multiple failures.

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

Chris:

As I explained in our phone conversation today, we will not go live on Monday as the performance on True Quote to date is not satisfactory.   In a joint meeting with True Quote on February 20, 2001 we discussed a testing plan that would target a go live date of March 12, 2001.  Due to consistent delays in delivery of the True Quote test sight and GUI, we have not been able to complete many aspects of the plan.  The limited testing we have done since getting a functional GUI on Wednesday has identified the following issues:

1. Unable to view and verify the test products for EnronOnline  Power.
2. Unable to verify failed transaction errors on the TrueQuote test site. No error messages are being sent when transactions fail. (only able to verify failures reasons that reach EOL).
3. Unable to stress test the system.
4. Prices and volume updates are being processed serially and are updating EXTREMELY slow.
5. Order History link on TQ test site does not appear to be functioning.  

In order to move this process along we would like to see significant progress by Monday March 12th.  In particular we would like to see the following:

1. At least 80% of the continuous price update standard of 20 - 25 updates per second
2. At least 80% of the peak price update standard of 100 - 200 updates per second
3. Ability to view and verify EnronOnline Power products
4. Ability to verify failed transactions on the True Quote

If we are able to see the progress on Monday we will need to begin stress testing immediately.  Throughout next week we will monitor progress on the stress testing and determine the next course of action.  The delays thus far have caused us to reschedule our testing teams calendar impacting other EnronOnline testing and roll-out.  Further delays will continue to impact our development and testing schedule.

As I mentioned I think it would be beneficial to have one of our testers working at your sight to make sure that we all are seeing the same issues and progress as True Quote.  We are agreeable to have one of our employees to your location to accomplish this.

I would also like to finalize discussions around the Access Agreement.  I will have Mark Greenberg send our comments.  Lets plan on talking on Monday to discuss the next step on this.

 Thanks

Bob:

Per our conversation this evening, I have requested an earlier update from
the team.  While it may be cutting it close, we are still confident the
system will be ready by Monday.  Stew is extremely confident the performance
issue will improve by fine tuning the stored procedures in the database.  We
are migrating the system tomorrow to our production environment.  This will
allow us the opportunity to flip the "live" switch the moment you and your
team gives the green light.  It will also allow us the flexibility of
working with the environment via a "back door" in our production facility.
This will actually expedite the process.  I suggest we chat in the morning
at your earliest convenience or 9AM CST, which ever comes first.  One issue
I need you to check on is your teams ability to quickly research the current
status of specific DEAL IDs.  I have heard from our team an issue during
today's testing whereby a DEAL ID was missing, and could not be readily
located by the EOL team.  I need to know from your side what was improper
about our request.  I am sure there is a simple explanation.

We are close to making this a reality.  I look forward to speaking with you
in the morning regarding the appropriate next steps.

Best regards,
Chris

Pursuant to Section 3(c) of the Truequote Price Posting Agreement, Truequote is required to "provide accurate matching ("mapping") through the ID interface".  I am working with product control and legal to conduct due diligence on the Truequote mapping as well as reviewing other aspects of the Truequote site that may create legally binding contracts.  Sign off by the legal group is a requirement for operating on third party transaction platforms and will be necessary prior to going live on Truequote.

In short the due diligence will focus on three primary areas:

Assuring that the product description language on the Truequote site accurately reflects Enron's products provisions
Physical testing to ensure that the mapping of products is accurate (ie when I select product A on Truequote I get product                       A on from Enron). 
Assuring Enron is comfortable with all legal ramifications which may arise as a result of language posted on the Truquote site.

Below are Mark Greenberg comments on the legal process for third party transaction sites

Bob -

Thanks for the information and access id's. 

As I indicated in my voice mail earlier today, the standard process is to run these deals through one central point and to ensure that a review of all descriptions and information related to each respective product to be traded is undertaken by a Legal Dept. member.   As you will note from the list of cc's, I have included legal dept. members involved in the physical power, physical gas and financial products areas.  These people will need to review the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Truequote site, as well as any other items associated with these products.  Accordingly, each of these individuals also needs a password/user id for due diligence purposes.


Each member of the legal and product control groups that are involved have an user id to Truequote and can begin the process.

Chris,

Here is our status as of yesterday and answers to Richard's comments:

Primary issue:  4 to 5 second latency between Enron Stack/EnronOnline TEST changes to TrueQuote browser update. Updates from the Enron Stack to the True Quote interface bridge are instantaneous. 

Other issues:
1.  Products hit/lifted on Truequote do not show price/volume updates from EnronOnline after transaction is complete on EnronOnline.
2.  Multiple product activation results in a "stepped" display of products on Truequote browser as opposed to all at once on EnronOnline.
3.  EnronOnline sends a bundle of information (e.g. products activated, prices changed, etc.) to the Truequote server.  Truequote server takes longer to process the incoming data than the EnronOnline server will stay connected.  Truequote has possibly resolved this issue by sending an immediate response for all incoming data in order to prevent the EnronOnline server from cutting the connection.

Oracle error:	Kevin Meredith  forwarded the email containing the text for the Oracle error to Kenneth Lim at 7:21AM.  Kenneth responded with an answer as to why we were receiving the error for transaction attempts by 7:36AM.  I informed Stewart Clark as to the status of the issue surrounding the Oracle error in our first conversation at approximately 9:00AM.  Kenneth's response: Approximately 6:20pm Wed night, there was an update to the TEST database which caused this error, we resolved this error along with our internal EnronOnlineTEST site with the resynching of our servers.

Price Update on any transaction attempt: This has always been the case with EnronOnline to ensure the correct price is showing

Bob:

Here is my latest update from my team.  How does it compare to your current
status?  In a conversation this morning with Stew, he brought up an
interesting point regarding the proposed performance of the connection.
Since we are using the public internet VPN tunnel, we are encrypting the
data to /from EOL during this test.  The encryption process is overhead on
the transfer between the systems.  When we begin using the dedicated T1s,
the plan is not to use the encryption between the sites.  This will
eliminate the associated overhead and increase performance.

I will also call you to follow-up.

Best regards,
Chris

Subject:	TQ-EOL test Status

Per your request, here are the testing status and issues:

Attempting Transactions:  EOL is sending an ORACLE Error which is failing
any transaction attempt.  A Bridge Server error is suspected.  A copy of the
Error was emailed to Kevin Meredith and Jason Althaus yesterday.  No
response yet.
EOL is sending a price update for any transaction attempt, Filled or Killed.
This was not expected by our team. (I think the stack manager is set up to
automatically regenerate a price, a different price if a transaction takes
place or same price if transaction is failed)
The price update triggers our Deal Execution Engine which attempts another
transaction, and we have a loop.
Performance issues:  We are looking into improving performance on our side
(such as better Data Base sweeping and STOR procedures).  In addition, EOL
is testing their speed on a LAN, we are testing over the internet with a
moderate-performance Server.
In addition, the first two issues have to be resolved before appropriate
performance evaluation can be meaningful.
During testing we came across some issues:
Bad TRP for BOM + 1 in Gas.  This was fixed
EOL tried sending wrong Prices, wrong volumes or wrong products to test how
our system will handle them.  These wrong products/ prices/volumes were
disregarded and not posted at all (which is what we are looking for)
Enform team are writing some code and changing other to accommodate some of
the issues that transpired during testing.

Regards,

Richard

Andy,

 After discussing the performance of True Quote with Mike Guadarrama I am increasingly concerned that they have problems which may take some time to overcome.  Mike believes that the speed issue is a result of the way they have designed their architecture.  If this is the case we will not see improved performance for some time.  

I've asked Mike to have a conversation with the True Quote developer to give us a better idea of what he believes the root problems are.  Based upon Mike's assessment we can get a feel of the time it may take to correct the problems.

We continue to spend a great deal of time testing with True Quote and this is consuming a fair amount of time for the testing team.

My understanding is that is correct except for the delays associated with
Mark's injury and equipment deliveries!!  I think we are getting close!

What do you think about Energy Clear??

After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today 
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking 
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager, 
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market 
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had 
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the 
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to 
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January 
deadline.  

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years 
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.

Andy,

Per your request, I have outlined below the key terms of the most recent
equity transaction.

On September 8, 2000, PG&E invested $2 million in return for 7,500,000
shares ($.2667/share).
Enron's shares outstanding net of clawback equal 7,268,058 * .2667 = $1,
938,391.
Total shares outstanding as of 2/1/01 equal 31,440,896.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Todd A. Creek

All,

In my haste to begin the four day weekend last week, I failed to send the 
status update I promised in my earlier note.  Below is a slightly tardy but 
nonetheless riveting Exchange Linking Status Update.

1.  Exchange Linking Software Development - Functional development was 
completed on schedule and we are currently performing testing of the Beta 
release.  Initial testing has gone very well.  
     A final release is scheduled for January 15th.  I will be working with 
Victoria Storey from the Operations group in turning over external testing of 
the system.  A deployment plan has been submitted to
     Operations to assist them with the rollout.

2.  Exchange Linking GUI - Development is complete and testing is being 
conducted.

3.  Product Mapping -  Product Control Group continues their effort of 
coordinating with TrueQuote the products covered under Schedule A of the 
contract.  Points of contact have been arranged 
      between Enron (Rob Cass) and TrueQuote (Richard Toubia) to continue the 
coordination effort required to support ongoing product mapping.

4.  Hardware - All network and server hardware has been received and 
installed.  

5.  Leased Lines - Anchi Z. has been coordinating with each exchange's 
network POC and assisting in obtaining T-1 lines to support this project.  In 
the absence of T-1 lines, both TrueQuote and Houston
     Street will be using VPN connectivity to conduct testing.  We should be 
up and running with TrueQuote by 28 December so that testing can begin.  
Houston Street does not anticipate being ready to 
     test anything until the end of February. 

6.  Bridging - Downstream system bridging modifications have been made to 
accommodate the addition of an external exchange id and an external exchange 
deal number.

7.  TrueQuote has stated that they will not make the contract date with 
regard to some of the functionality of their system.  They hope to be able to 
fully act as a client exchange but are not prepared to
      take on the role of an external exchange (i.e. handle transaction 
attempts from Enron.)

8.  Houston Street is back in the picture.  Their stated contract date is 
December 4th + 120 calendar days.  This gives them some breathing room.  They 
have canned Sapient, built their own internal 
      IT team, purchased messaging software from Web Methods and changed 
hosting providers.  They will no longer use Genuity out of Boston but Data 
Return out of Dallas for their hosting needs.

Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

-David

Andy,

We have seen very little progress from True Quote so far this week.  We have been unable to test on yesterday or today.  Chris Edmonds did call yesterday and indicate that the sight would be available after lunch on Monday however that never happended.

Andy:

Please review the comments below.  As I stated in our meeting on Friday, I
have been pushing our team for the February 16th deadline.  Unfortunately,
there are some issues that have not been resolved and may be putting our
deadline in jeopardy.  I wanted you to review this summary of the current
state of affairs and compare it to your team's opinion on the situation.
Again, this is Maria's view of the situation, which might be totally
different from your team's perspective.  We do not want the situation to
become an "us v. them" mentality, so I am taking this opportunity to solicit
your feedback.  Dennis and I are hoping we can work diligently to make up
this time and resolve these issues in a joint effort.  We look forward to
your comments and completing this link once and for all.

Please let me know if I can provide any other input.

Best Regards,
Chris

Subject: Concerns with Status of Enron Integration Testing


Chris,

Dennis asked that I send you a note expressing our concern with the delays
that we have been experiencing with the Enron Integration testing.

We have essentially not made any progress since we began testing "Enron
Posting Prices to True Quote" on January 17th.  First, the test did not work
because there was a problem at Enron with price updates not posting
correctly to their integration server.  This problem was resolved and we
were asked to repeat the test a week later on January 24th.  This test was
also unsuccessful because the data we received did not contain any spaces
between words.  As of today, it has not been determined whether the problem
is on Enron's side or ours.  We have been continuing to research the problem
on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our
server without the spaces. Enron's Operations group was planning to do a
test today to "sniff" the network to determine how the data is actually
leaving their firewall, but they have had other problems that have prevented
them from working with us today.  Last Friday they were not able to spend
any time working with us because they were getting ready for their
maintenance window.

Our concern is that each time we have encountered a problem, it has taken
several days to resolve the issue before we can move on to the next series
of tests.  Understanding that the due date is only 3 weeks away, the True
Quote team is concerned that Enron is not providing enough resources to work
the problems immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.  Part of
the reason for some of the delay on Enron's side may be that the group that
is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for
assistance each time they have encountered a problem (at least that's our
understanding).  We don't believe that there is anyone in the developer
group that is dedicated to resolve our problems as soon as one is reported.

The reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different
disconnected teams working on the project.  As we move forward we would like
to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing
activities:

1) Rather than working as two disconnected teams (testing via conference
call), it would be helpful if we had an Enron person here in our office each
time we test and communicate back to Enron the results that we are getting.
That person should be someone that has a direct link back to the developers
group, the operations group, and the products group.

2) The Enron resource should have as their priority to work with the
necessary groups within Enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

3) The developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the
testers as quickly as possible.

We welcome any other suggestions that you or Andy have to improve the speed
of our testing and implementation process.  Please let me know once you've
had a chance to speak to Andy if there is anything that he can do to provide
us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously.

Regards,

Chris,

The System Test environment has not been available this morning for a couple
of reasons.  During the code migration code last evening which resolved the
problem of Power Prices not displaying correctly, an unrelated problem arose
with one of the application controls that handles some of the grid display
features.  During one of the comipiles the .dll was corrupted.  This has
required us to rebuild the control and update the entire application to
reference the newly rebuilt contol's class id.  Although the Power products
have been active since last night, we have been unable to bring the system
test environment on-line for testing because of the corrupted application
control.  We anticipate that the system will be back up within the next
hour, by 2pm (barring any other unforeseen problems).  We apologize for any
inconvenience that we've caused for the Enron testing effort this morning.

To address Enron's concerns expressed to you during this morning's
conference call, here is what we are currently doing in each of these areas:

Performance of the system - We believe we know exactly what is causing the
performance problem.  However, the person that is best qualified to resolve
that problem has been extremely busy addressing other issues, such as
verifying that the integrity of the data and messages that are sent back and
forth are accurate.  This person will spend the majority of today and
tomorrow fine-tuning performance.  We have a very high degree of confidence
that we can improve performance in short order to the level that is
acceptable to Enron.

Power Prices - We observed some problems with the Power filters and took
these products offline yesterday so that we could work on the problem.  We
believe the problem has been resolved and have migrated the code to System
Test.  Although Power Prices are available right now, the System Test
environment is offline right now due to code migrations unrelated to the
power issue.

Notification of Failed Transactions - The concern is that when a user's
order results in an attempted transaction against EOL and a Failure message
is received from Enron, the True Quote system does not display a message to
the user explaining that Counterparty was not available to fill the order.
We have analysts working on the notification messages right now.  If a
user's order is submitted with a duration of 'Fill or Kill' and the order is
not filled at least partially, we plan to push a message notification to the
user stating the following:  "Your order was received by the system;
however, no counterparties were available to fill your request".  We may
also display a 'small print' disclaimer at the bottom of the message that
says:  *Orders may not be filled due to unavailable volume, credit
limitations, or another platform particpant acquiring the volume slightly
ahead of your order request."  The wording of this message is pending
approval by True Quote executive management.    These changes will be
migrated to System Test this weekend.

Stress Testing - We are also concerned with the lack of stress testing that
we have been able to perform and have been concerned with amount of
realistic functionality testing that can be accomplished given the
compressed testing timeframe.  True Quote is dedicated to completing as much
functional testing and performance tuning as possible and will have our
entire team here all weekend to press forward with these efforts.  It was
our understanding that Enron and True Quote management had decided to forego
stress testing in order to take this system into production by March 12.  We
have assumed and planned for more rigorous stress testing using the System
Test environment AFTER March 12 to improve performance over the coming
weeks.  If management has now decided that a thorough and complete system
wide stress test is a pre-production requirement, then we agree that March
12 is not a realistic Go-Live date.

Yesterday, we received several errors from EOL when we attempted to login
and when we attempted to execute transactions.  The following is a list of
errors that we received throughout the day:

9:07 a.m. to 9:10 a.m.	Received three "Internal Server Error - Unable to
process request" messages
12:10 a.m.		Received three "Internal Server Error - Unable to process
request" messages
12:13 a.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
12:14 a.m.		Receved "A connection with the server could not be established"
message
12:15 a.m.		Received "Failure msg = User not found in session" Code = "Bus"
message
12:25 a.m. 		Received "Internal Server Error - Unable to process request"
message
2:43 p.m.		Received two Attempt Transactions failed with "Failure: Broker
user's session invalid" messages
2:51 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
3:06 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Failure: Broker user's session
invalid" message
4:47 p.m.		Attempt Transaction failed with "Counterparty has no offer access
to product" message

We are concerned about the stability of the Enron servers.  Could you please
ask Bob in investigate why we are getting these types of errors throughout
the day?  We are also concerned that the process for verifying the status of
a transaction that has not completed in a reasonable amount of time is not
yet in place at Enron.  We see this as a critical process that must be in
place and working before we go live.  In addition, we have experienced
things like receiving messages that we had not anticipated, receiving random
credit updates that we thought we had agree that we would not receive, and
changes in XML attributes and content that we had not seen in previous
testing.

We are working very hard to address issues as quickly as we can and
appreciate very much having Matt Mottsinger addressing issues on Enron's
side as quickly as possible.  We will take their offer on using Matt to a
higher degree.  If it makes sense for him to be here at our site this
weekend, than we are happy to find him place to work in our environment, but
if it makes more sense to have him available from Enron's location, we can
stay in contact with him via telephone.

Andy,

Below are a number of the e-mail's that I've exchanged with TrueQuote.  I 
can't say that they make for interesting reading but if you note any 
potential issues please let me know.  Most of the notes relate to product 
mapping issues but you will notice highlighted in red a note regarding the 
ordering of a leased line which in my mind is "acceptance of responsibility 
by action."  I'll be crafting a note regarding testing soon and will 
coordinate this with Jay and yourself.  I'll also be forwarding e-mails with 
Houston Street.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further 
clarify our status.

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
"green".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

David,

I really appreciate your efforts in adding another hour to our meeting this
afternoon and in making Jay available for the discussion.  The following is
a list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this
afternoon's meeting:

1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We
will need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,
CPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know
all of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do
they know that for example, PID "123" maps back to Product "ABC"?  I would
think the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to
specific product information on your system.

2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from
"Required" to "Implied" during the last version of the DTD that we received
from you?

3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:
There are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is
passed between systems.
The following is a list of those specified in the External Interface
Document:

Post Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Request Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Attempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)

Should all of the parameter names be "xml" or should the parameter names for
Post Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the
naming convention of the other use cases?

Using "xml" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the
redundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal
interfaces.

4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on
our system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss
alternatives for dealing with date interpretation.

5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent
back within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that
confirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no
interface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this
assumption in this meeting.

6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt
if for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a
transaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?

7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as
opposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is
a generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting
files.

Thanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you
later today!

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

I understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product
mapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or
Mike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.
Jay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.  I know
you've asked some technical questions already and are also interested in
credit mapping nevertheless, would you please provide a brief rundown of
the technical issues you want to discuss so that Jay/Mike can be prepared
in advance to make the best use of the hour?  Thanks.

The meetings will be attended by our Product Control Group who are
responsible for creating and maintaining all of Enron's product types and
products.  They are the experts when it comes knowing all the various ways
Enron represents and implements products on EnronOnline.  Other than
myself, the four attendees will be Sheri Thomas, who heads the Product
Control group, Jennifer deBoisblanc-Denny, who heads the products area of
the group and two experts in gas and power products.

Look forward to hearing from you soon so I can inform Jay and Mike.

Regards
-David

There will be people there that understand the products in non-technical
detail.

When were you thinking we could involve your "technical" people?  I agree
with the agenda and strongly agree that we need to understand each other
products before we can attempt an integration.  However, my team's
reponsibility is to figure out how to "technically" send/receive and map
information from your system.  If this is not going to be addressed the
first day, than perhaps some of them don't need to come.  I guess I'm now
concerned that the second two hour meeting isn't going to be long enough to
provide my team the information they need proceed with their technical
implementation.  I understand that the documents you've sent me should
address most of our questions, but each revision has left my team with more
questions and confusion about how this is all going to work.

Will Jay Webb be in either meeting?  Could you send us a list of the
attendees on your side and their roles/functions as well.   We want very
much to make these meetings as productive as possible, understanding that
your team as well as mine are very very busy.

I appreciate your help,

Maria

Maria,

Thanks for the finalized list.  I assume that one or more of the people
below will be able to speak in detail about gas and power products outside
of the technical domain?  The people from Enron that will attend the
meeting are non-technical.  Their area of expertise lies in the arena of
products and their management.  I just want to make sure that we have
people that will be speaking the same language.

Attached is the agenda for the meetings.

Oh, I see, my misunderstanding.  We are in 3 Greenway Plaza.  Two 2-hour
meetings is fine with us. No problem in us driving downtown.  However,
could
we schedule from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 on the 8th, and from 10:00 to 12:00 on
the 9th?  I have a conflict on the 8th.

The agenda looks fine.  If there are any additional XML-type questions left
to answer by the time we have the meeting, we may want to allow some time
to
discuss them.

Thanks again David, looking forward to meeting in person.

Maria,

Actually, I was suggesting 2 hours on both the 8th and the 9th of November
for getting together to discuss mapping issues.  If November 8th and 9th
isn't good for you, we can try November 9th and 10th.  I would say let's
just get together for one, four hour meeting but it is difficult to get the
Product Control people together for that length of time since they are
integral to the day to day operations of EnronOnline.  (I am assuming you
are in downtown Houston.  If getting here is difficult then we can try to
arrange a one day meeting.) Any thoughts on the suggested dates/times?

As far as the number of meetings required, from our point of view we just
need to accomplish product and counterparty mappings.  The agenda below
addresses products and a follow-up would address counterparties.  Beyond
that, the External Interface Document and DTD should address all the
technical issues that enable you to design and construct your part of the
system.  I'll send you the most recent External Interface Document and DTD
shortly.

Please let me know you thoughts on the proposed agenda.  I'm sure we can
work out an agreeable schedule.

Regards,
David

Agenda
11/8/2000 10:00-12:00  Clarification of product representation and product
creation
process.

It is important to understand each other's methods for representing
products and the process by which we create new products prior to jumping
in to the mapping problem.

11/9/2000 10:00-12:00  Map schedule A products.

It is important to not only know which products of ours map to yours but
what process can be applied to make mapping easily repeatable.

Hi David,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I was out of the office

2
hours is not going to be enough. Do you expect this to be the first of

Richard/Maria,

Attached please find the 'treatments' for the various Tokenized reference
periods currently in use for US Nat Gas and US Power.  I believe you will
find these spreadsheets easier to translate than the previous.  Let me know
what you think.  As you've pointed out it is critical that we are both on
the same page when it comes to our treatments of these reference periods;
however, I do believe this is an issue that we can work through together.
I would suggest that we get together again for another couple hours once
you've had the chance to review not only the info I've provided to date but
also the list of Schedule A products that I plan to provide on Wednesday.
As always, feel free to drop me a note or give me a call anytime.

Regards,
David

P.S.  Please keep in mind that the present structure of the TRP's do not
contemplate weekends that breach a calendar month, and holidays.  For
example, a US Nat Gas Day Ahead product (Number XXXX)  being offered after
11:00 a.m. on a Thursday the 27th will provide a TRP Product for Saturday
the 29th, Sunday the 30th, and Monday the 1st. Since our trading areas
would not want to breach the current calendar month, they would create two
date-specific products; Number YYYY for Saturday the 29th through Sunday
the 30th, and Product Number ZZZZ for Monday the 1st.

A question has come up that may have serious implications for our system.
Please forward to the right person, we would really appreciate it if we
could have a response as soon as possible.

The question is "How many transaction attempts can be sent by Enron to True
Quote at one time(will Enron be sending more than transaction in a batch)?"
Your documentation seems to read that you may be sending more than one
transaction at a time.  If that is true, then we may have a problem if you
plan to send transaction searches that would force us to cancel all of the
previous transaction attempts that were sent over together, since our system
processes items in sequential order.

Please call me if the question seems confusing.

Subject: FW: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Good morning David,

Here's another clarifying question.  I have in my notes documentation that
says that Enron will do partial fills of transactions sent to EOL. The
question that being asked in the attached note has to do with transactions
sent by EOL to TrueQuote.  Does Enron want (or will Enron accept) partial
fills by the True Quote system? If so, how should we identify (if at all)
that this was a partial fill?

Thanks David.

Subject: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Maria,

Matt raised a question regarding transaction attempts made by Enron Traders
directly against the True Quote system (not going through EOL).  This is a
two scenario question:

1)  If an Enron trader is initiating a buy in the True Quote system against
a counterparty's position to sell at a specified price and volume (ie:
15,000 @ 2.40 - which is currently a valid market in True Quote), at the
point the transaction is being executed in the system, the volume drops to
10,000, would our Enron want to fill whatever quantity they can at the given
price.  Currently we are interpreting all transactions made directly from
Enron into the True Quote system will be entered as a Fill or Kill.
Will Enron allow partial fills of transaction attempts?
Also, should the successful transaction attempt consist of several parties,
will Enron accept this (3 parties of 5,000 each)?
Do we send back a response identifying a FILL for the partial volume and
FAIL for the remaining volume?

2)  Reverse the statement for an attempt of Enron to Sell a volume against a
counterparty's position to buy.  Is Enron willing to sell partial volumes
should the market not be there to fill Enron's order completely?

David,

I am forwarding you minutes taken from the conference call with Enron of
Sept 26th.  This was before you joined the project, but as you can see, we
were told that partial fills would be possible.  The answers appear in blue.

Chris,

Wayne and I have reviewed this transcript from the conversation with Enron.
During that conversation, several items were to be worked offline.  These
are detailed and are listed as "To be worked offline" in Exhibit B, C, D,
and E.

Would you like to have EnFORM participate in your discussion with Enron, or
do you feel that these items are strategically sensitive enough that you
should have this conversation without EnFORM's involvement?

These "To be worked offline" issues are very important, but we do have
additional technical questions that would best be addressed by a technical
Enron contact.  If we could begin the process of a establishing a technical
"relationship" with an individual at Enron as soon as possible, it would
speed development and lower costs of this project.

P.S.  Wayne was next to me as I typed this note.

Regards,
Maria

The following questions were discussed in the telephone conference call with
Enron on September 26th.  We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have
highlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.


Questions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:

High Priority Questions (need to be addressed):
(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically
identify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /
location, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?

Product ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates
Product ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and
counterparty
Product ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to
last day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not
both (there is no reason for redundancy)
Product ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized
products/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the
first day of that spot month)
Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute


(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an
Enron product id is a "Fill or Kill" transaction, meaning, a transaction
attempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not
immediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will
be immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if
market conditions made the order viable.

A transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be "Fill or Kill" (It will not in
stay in EOL's system)

If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,
these volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system

If a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately
rebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system

Does True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal
transaction for an outside entity?

Enron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design
functionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.

What is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction
attempt?

Enron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold
for waiting.

What is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?

The EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on
Monday, October 2, 2000.

Exhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):

Concerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently
handles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing
potentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given
this level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be
accomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:

What is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that
will be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these
products will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per
second?

Although it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it
was clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time
intervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled
(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)
Need to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL
will send them automatically at certain time intervals.

Will there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product
update, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple
Enron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote
need to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive
one XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron
products?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how
often will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron
product, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document
submissions per second?

The XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one
Product ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one
Product ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.

Can we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per
Enron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity
offerings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.

Enron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL
is exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product
ID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the
Offer.

The interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the
order.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a
product price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be
loaded with a duration of "Good Until Canceled".  True Quote will mark the
order as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product
that changes the status to "Suspended".  In this case True Quote would
cancel the order on the True Quote system.

All orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull
the deals.  At this time, EOL would send "Suspended Status" for the Product
ID.

How are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron
commodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new
product id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to
November?
 Yes

If product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable
term, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote
platform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is
associated with?
Product IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term

We are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a
product offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and
tradable term.
This assumption is correct

Can we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform
will be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be
re-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will
the assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active
until the status has been changed to "Suspended"?

All EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For
those that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that
removes all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will
authenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be
transmitted to True Quote.

Exhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):

For each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data
types (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a
character, what is the character indicator?  B/A?

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we confirm the data type for volume is integer?

This information still needs to be provided.

Across all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and
volume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of
measure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product
ids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for
natural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?

Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute

Price - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)

This information still needs to be provided.

Volume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value
established for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For
example, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is
5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume
increments, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).

On EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the
minimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).

To be worked Offline:
How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader
has a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we
display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)


Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id
is a "Fill or Kill" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to
Enron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If
the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed
from Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made
the order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to
non-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True
Quote system.

Already answered above.

Will Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron
price interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote
submit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron
offer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a
transaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?

Enron will allow partial fills.

Exhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):
Does Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an
Enron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available
for that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?
This would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True
Quote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep
multiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to
satisfy transaction attempt.
Alternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best
individual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from
only one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote
would not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML
interface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules
maintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).
Alternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price
offerings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume
offerings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point
should be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True
Quote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit
individual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate
volume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and
choose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer
service agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological
sequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.

Enron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.
Enron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron
Product ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for
100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of
10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).

To be worked Offline:
Fair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of
orders without bias)
Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
Need to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in
the market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given
Product ID's market depth.

Our concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and
their associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),
giving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could
potentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require
deals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request
was received by the True Quote platform.


Exhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):
Are we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against
True Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the
duration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be "Fill or Kill" or
some other duration?

To be worked Offline:
The traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without
adjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will
be to be discussed.

Exhibit E (Counterparty Interface):
In general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of
their daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day
counterparty credit/term interface:
Currently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an
XML DTD.
What are the "terms" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For
example, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial
limits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)
by Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,
deal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /
no' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the
Enron product id?

To be worked Offline:
Credit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the
teleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better
understand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling
Enron's credit structure.


Questions for True Quote to Answer:

Exhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing
transactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction
Interface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders
proposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of
transaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have
to invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply
confirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it
succeeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the
deal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.
What is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction
attempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should
alert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to
return either a confirmation or failure.

Please respond to the questions above.

Thank you.

* Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions

Subject: RE: One other item about Enron...


Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
"day 2" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

David,

I am in Seattle until Sunday.

No, I have not heard anything from Truequote since they and I had our first

Maria,

Stewart is correct in his understanding of no parital fills.  I will
reiterate his statements through the following examples:

If Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote
attempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if
the following 3 criteria are met:

1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.
2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the
trader.
3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the
trader.

Examples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:

1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume
available for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will
fail.
2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction
will fail.
3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.

I set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is
the earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference
call with you.  For the time being let's stay the course.

Regards,
David

Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to
transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting
interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
"day 2" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction
attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your
help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in
the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but
what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we
should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better
in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

The True Quote test site is still not available this morning.  Chris indicated they should have a much faster site by lunch time.  

I mentioned to Chris that we were very concerned about there ability to move things forward.  I also indicated that you may be giving Dennis a call to discuss.

I left you a voice mail but thought Id drop a note to.  Truequote is extremely unhappy with the fact that we are doing broker client and feel it undermines their business plan.  Chris indicated they would be giving Greg Whalley a call.  You can reach me at 713 825-6372 with any questions.
