Attached is a scenario that Phillip created and we were hoping to review
with you at last week's and today's meeting.  We are aware of how hectic
things are right now at Enron, so we completely understand you having to
cancel our meetings.  However, if you could please review the attached
scenario and return it to us with your comments as soon as possible, it
would be greatly appreciated.

For your review:

1.Please fill in the positions associated with each risk bucket for natural
and initial positions for gas and aluminum as well as the positions created
by
   buying or selling each instrument
2.If aluminum has different risk buckets than natural gas, please add them
along with the associated positions for natural, initial, and those created
by the
   instruments
3.Is the wording of the instrument names correct and how do we denote that
they are for aluminum rather than natural gas?
4.We (not Phillip )made up all of the numbers on the pricing screen and the
settlement prices so please feel free to change any/all numbers that are
    unrealistic or contradict the optimal hedge (the optimal hedge turns
out to be a loss based on our numbers!)
5.In the scenario overview, we made up the locations Midwest and
Permian---change if unrealistic and please add appropriate locations for
the
   instruments on the pricing screen
6.The optimal hedge given by Phillip is listed on page 2; Based on the
optimal hedge, please specify the payout and amount received for each
    instrument as well as the overall P&L
7. In the scenario overview, do you know if 20,000MMBtu creating 2,000 tons
of aluminum is a realistic conversion?
8. Could you please explain WHY each instrument creates/covers a position
for some risks and not others.
9. Please list any information that was not included and that the learner
would need in order to hedge this scenario

In your return e-mail, if you could also please give us a definition for
natural and initial position.  Make your changes and answers directly onto
the word document.  When you get this, if you could please e-mail or call
me (ext. 56686) with when we can expext to get this back from you and with
any quesitons you might have.  Thank you very much for helping us with
this.

Hi Dutch,

I am preparing for the final signoff phase on the graphics and practice
questions and I need your help finalizing the scenarios that we talked
about two weeks ago for Futures and Options.  You were going to provide us
with a total of four scearios with answers to the following questions: (a.)
Are you long or Short? (b.) What is your Risk? (c.) What is your break-even
price? (d) Give the settlement price (e) What is the total P/L on the
option.  Did you get a chance to review that email that I sent you on
10/29/01.

Lastly, I would like for you to review the graphic ideas and practice
exercise and let me know if you are okay with the questions that are being
asked to the learner.  Attached below are the two topics that you are
responsible for in the Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at 713-345-6687.

Hello Dutch.

Hope you are having a good Monday. I've delayed this message in hopes that
you catch up with the last three weeks' assignments that you have not
handed in yet. As I noted in our discussion last week, it will be
signficantly helpful to Monica and I to receive any information you've
gathered to this point, as opposed to receiving it all at the end.

As usual, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that
you should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember, this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!

Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).

We need examples of:
Cap (Call Option)
Floor
Collar

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

Dutch
How are you today? I hope all is well.
I know you are extremely busy meeting our financial targets for Q4/01. In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  

However at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:

	Issues for Management Attention
Dutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.


My initial question to you: "Is this statement accurate?"

My next Questions: "What Can I do to assist you?"
			 "Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)

Here is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:
	BRM Text book
	Derivatives I as a resource only
	The slides attached below
	Other course work as a resource only

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for all your assistance and I know how busy you are & how important your commercial duties are for the company. Thanks

Cheers

Team
Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).

We need examples of:
Cap (Call Option)
Floor
Collar

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

You probably have Internet Explorer version 5.0 or older. You need version
5.5 or newer. Just go ahead and send me the assignments in an email or Word
document - whichever is easier - I'll take care of the rest.

Thanks for doing the assignments!

Hi Dutch --

Since you offered to answer some of my questions over e-mail, I will take
you up on it!    I would still like to get some of your time Monday or
Tuesday to go into more detailed discussion.

Question 1:
When we talk about "the market" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and "fake" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?


Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

Thanks so much for your time, Dutch.

Have a terrific weekend!
Ann

Hi there Dutch!

How are you? Hope you're doing well.

We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What is
actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then
select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our other
scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage
decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would
the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

Ann

Good afternoon, everyone.

I have some good news to share with you. There will be no new assignments!
We are hoping you will take the time this week to finish up past
assignments. In addition, we are working on some of your past assignments
and all future assignments by cutting/pasting from the course material that
we have received from Enron HR. We will be asking you to review these
assignments and update them as necessary. You will still be responsible for
reviewing and granting final sign-off the topics.

Assignment Status:
Berney Aucoin:  We are working with Errol McLaughlin from Jeff Gossett's
group to help with the remaining Accounting & Reporting topic assignments.
We still need your last three assignments from the Organization Structure
topic because current courses we have available to us do not cover this
content. They include write-ups about:
     Roles and Responsibilities of Mid-Marketers / Origination
     Roles and Responsibilties of Traders
     Structure of a Trading Organization
Please let us now when you will be able to send these to us. Thanks.

Mark Reese: We have been able to find information for the "Risk Management"
portion of your 10/26 assignment and your future assignment. Eventually, we
will need you to review what we have put together. In addition, we still
need your last four assignments because current courses we have available
to us do not cover this content in detail. They include write-ups about:
     Marking to Market, Pricing Models (10/19), Technical Analysis (10/26),
     Fundamental Analysis (11/2) and VaR (11/9) for the Risk Management
     Inputs topic
     Pricing of Hedging Instruments (11/2) (high-level process and
     discussion about bid/mid/offer) from the Hedging Basics topic

Ed McMichael: Thank you for your handing in most of your assignments on
time! As we discussed, you accidently left out your write-up on "Additional
Types of Risks" (11/2) and are going to send that to us this week. You also
have the "Natural Gas Markets" assignment (11/9) outstanding that the
Research group is working on. Please forward us that assignment when you
recieve it.  The only assignments that are remaining for your topics are
about Crude Oil and Electiricty Markets. We are working on finding course
material/resources to help write these. Let us know if you find any leads
for these assignments. Moving forward, we will be requesting your review
and final sign-off on the topic.

Dutch Quigley: We are going to cut/paste the information for the Futures
and Options topics from BRM. I think that Futures will require little time
for your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the
Options topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting
you in the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and
sign-off on this work.

Andy Lewis:  We are going to cut/paste the information for the Forwards and
Options topics from BRM. I think that Forwards will require little time for
your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the Swaps
topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting you in
the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and sign-off on
this work.

Thank you and have a good week.

Thanks Dutch.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this. These are
pretty basic questions, so do you think you have answers for me by end of
the week? Please let me know if you need clarification.

Thanks again,

      Hi there Dutch!

      How are you? Hope you're doing well.

      We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us
   the
      framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
      questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
      description of this problem in the word doc below, just for
   reference.

      1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.
   We
      understand that since the users are making storage decisions and
   hedging
      future months, they need to take time value of money into account.
   What
      is
      actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the
   instruments?
      How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

      2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and
      then
      select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our
      other
      scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the
   Enron
      risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
      appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the
   instruments
      cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by
      storage
      decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
      thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then
      would
      the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

      Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

      Ann

Attached is a scenario that Phillip created and we were hoping to review
with you at last week's and today's meeting.  We are aware of how hectic
things are right now at Enron, so we completely understand you having to
cancel our meetings.  However, if you could please review the attached
scenario and return it to us with your comments as soon as possible, it
would be greatly appreciated.

For your review:

1.Please fill in the positions associated with each risk bucket for natural
and initial positions for gas and aluminum as well as the positions created
by
   buying or selling each instrument
2.If aluminum has different risk buckets than natural gas, please add them
along with the associated positions for natural, initial, and those created
by the
   instruments
3.Is the wording of the instrument names correct and how do we denote that
they are for aluminum rather than natural gas?
4.We (not Phillip )made up all of the numbers on the pricing screen and the
settlement prices so please feel free to change any/all numbers that are
    unrealistic or contradict the optimal hedge (the optimal hedge turns
out to be a loss based on our numbers!)
5.In the scenario overview, we made up the locations Midwest and
Permian---change if unrealistic and please add appropriate locations for
the
   instruments on the pricing screen
6.The optimal hedge given by Phillip is listed on page 2; Based on the
optimal hedge, please specify the payout and amount received for each
    instrument as well as the overall P&L
7. In the scenario overview, do you know if 20,000MMBtu creating 2,000 tons
of aluminum is a realistic conversion?
8. Could you please explain WHY each instrument creates/covers a position
for some risks and not others.
9. Please list any information that was not included and that the learner
would need in order to hedge this scenario

In your return e-mail, if you could also please give us a definition for
natural and initial position.  Make your changes and answers directly onto
the word document.  When you get this, if you could please e-mail or call
me (ext. 56686) with when we can expext to get this back from you and with
any quesitons you might have.  Thank you very much for helping us with
this.

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.

Hello Dutch.

I hope this week hasn't been too stressful for you. I know there is a lot
going on right now. I responded to your last note explaining that you can
send your past assignments to me via e-mail. I wanted to re-iterate this
because I have not yet received them.

Per usual, this week's assignment - Assignment #5 is detailed below.

This Week's Assignment: Write about each of the following areas:
1) Market Valuation (Page 1_4_5_1  in the Futures topic)
2) Option Packages (Page 1_7_6_1 - in the Options topic)

Due Date: Friday, November 9th, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Market Valuation - This is a short explanation. Do you need graphics to
represent this?
?    Short in the futures market: rising prices result in losses and
decreasing prices result in profits
?    Long in the futures market: rising prices result in profits and
decreasing prices result in losses
?    2-3 examples to explain this concept

Option Packages.
Dutch - This discussion should stay at a very high-level with only basic
examples
   Caps
   Floors
   Collars
   Different users and how they would use these option packages
     End user
     Producer
   Examples using caps, puts and/or collars

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

Thank you.

Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards
to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course content -
you can copy/paste straight from there.

I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
morning and get back to you.

Have a good night.

Absolutely. We'll see you in John Arnold's office today at 2:30.

Have a good morning!

By the way, Kirk isn't in yet - so I couldn't ask him about Nymex's
website. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

Hi Dutch,

Thank you for emailing me this morning, to let us know that you would be
available to meet with us today.  It is very important that we setup some
time with you next week.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I am preparing for the final signoff on all of the topics this week and
next.  The Due Date is 11/15.  I need to know if you are okay with the
graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen so far for the
Futures and Options.

Lastly, I incorporated the practice questions into both the Futures and
Options that you sent me last week.  You stated that there will be more to
come, if so email those questions and I can add them as well.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need to help developing
the graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Let me know if you have any question, I can be reached at x5-6687.

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

Hello Dutch.

Thanks for meeting with us today - I think we gained a lot of ground. I've
delayed this message for a couple of days in hopes that you catch up with
the last two weeks' assignments that you have not handed in yet.

Again, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that you
should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember - this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!

This Week's Assignment: This week's assignment will be to write about each
of the following areas:
1) Benefits & Challenges (Page  1_4_6_1  in the Futures topic)
2) Buying a Put/Selling a Put (Page 1_7_5_1 - in the Options topic)

Due Date: Friday, October 26th, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Benefits & Challenges of Using Futures
?    Benefits
-    Financial and performance guarantee

-    Need to be aware of physical obligation at expiration, if there is no
intention of receiving or taking delivery
-    Do not know counterparty (only if you go to delivery)
-    Only Henry Hub

Buying a Put/Selling a Put
-    Buying a Put: Short position
-    Physical and financial example and payout associated with it
-    Selling a Put: Long position
-    Physical and financial example and payout associated with it
-    Market expectations on when to buy or sell a put

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

Dutch -

I confirm with Mery Brown, the simulation lead, and the simulation may just
TOUCH upon delta but will not include any other greeks.  Hope this helps
and I look forward to reading those assignments!  :)

Have a good week.
