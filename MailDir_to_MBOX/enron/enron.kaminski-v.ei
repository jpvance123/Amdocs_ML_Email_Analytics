John,

Sorry for the confusion.
This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute.

Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

Vince

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Dear Mr. Fujita:

I will be glad to make the dinner arrangements.  I will make reservations at
the "LaTour D'Argent" Restaurant located at 2011 Ella Blvd at T. C. Jester.
for 6:30 PM on the 17th.  They do require a coat.

I believe most of the cabs will know where it is - but just in case:

"Take I-45 North to 610 East, go to the Ella Blvd exit and turn left (back
under the freeway) on Ella Blvd.  Go to 2011 Ella Blvd. (on the right)."

Look forward to having you at Enron.

Thank you.

Vince,

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though 
officially, I am on vacation).  Would like to catch up with you if possible.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

Regards,
Sandeep.

It is finally Quit India time for Enron. Though the controversial=20

and others to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the=
=20
best course for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic=
al=20
force majeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will=20
certainly weaken its case. The committee points out that the many=20
=01&infirmities=018 in the DPC approval process brings into question the =
=01&propriety=20
of the decisions=018.

 It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India=01,s=20
policy-makers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of=20
techno-economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation=
al=20
contracts. The committee says it is =01&troubled with the failure of govern=
ance=20
that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making=
=20
process on matters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broa=
d,=20
across different governments at different points of time, at both the state=
=20
and the central level, and across different agencies associated with=20
examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels. =
It=20
strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to=20
execute assigned responsibilities is purely co-incidental=018.

Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate=
=20
these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary in=
=20
the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry into=
=20
the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial=20
inquiry would delay the negotiation process and =01&not serve any purpose=
=018.=20
There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in=20
renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enron=01,s exit, but the report certa=
inly=20
provides the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that i=
t=20
needs to start an investigation.

CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the=
=20
deal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the=20
political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the=
=20
CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of =01&government=20
functionaries including political executives=018 and ensure =01&appropriate=
 action=018=20
against them. If it is indeed able to establish =01&undue influence=018 in =
signing=20
the contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently=20
against the public interest without any monetary liability.

The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who=
=20
have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that=
=20
Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated,=
=20
regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=01,s (=
MSEB)=20
financial distress. Also that DPC=01,s extortionate tariffs are not merely=
=20
because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, b=
ut=20
mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enron=
=01,s=20
contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw material=
=20
(ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply=20
estimates and several legal requirements and permissions.

In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930=
=20
crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 253=
=20
crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per ce=
nt=20
of the capacity is used for DPC. There=01,s also a Rs 100 crore extra billi=
ng to=20
the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these=20
facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging mo=
re=20
than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government o=
f=20
India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. It has=
=20
also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel=20
consumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the powe=
r=20
purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed=
=20
it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage=20
opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra.=20

The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four=20
different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: =
a=20
rate of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee=
=20
loans, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dolla=
r=20
as reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculati=
ng=20
Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges=
=20
has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough=20
negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment.=20

The Godbole committee has established that DPC=01,s tariffs can easily be h=
alved=20
if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the=20
dollarisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (whic=
h=20
is in fact hampering MSEB=01,s reform particularly in power distribution) a=
re=20
scrapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tari=
ff=20
would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system.=
=20
The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if th=
e=20
multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it should=
=20
free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside=20
Maharashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all=
=20
projects negotiated by government: =01&The public has a right to know what =

particularly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within=
=20
two months.

Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state governme=
nt=20
were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with=
=20
power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of=
=20
power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations shoul=

be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. This=20

"The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken=

Committee Report

An investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three=20
governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid =
by=20
Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to t=
he=20
committee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and=
=20
state, and across different agencies. "It strains belief to accept that suc=
h=20
widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely=20
coincidental," the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implement=
ed=20
if something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also fel=
t=20
that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to=20
order a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress=
=20
leader: "Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra=
=20
and put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector."

The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: "If the Enr=
on=20
decision has at all been detrimental, it is because of the haste with which=
=20
phase 2 was cleared by the Shiv Sena-bjp government. Now with the state=20
having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing is=
=20
to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it's=
=20
not an issue of corruption but that of perception."=20

Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the=
=20
Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was=
=20
cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal=20
Reddy: "Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over=20
Tehelka." Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting=

could send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from=20
Maharashtra, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted wit=

the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue. "I think I know Vilasr=

The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to=
 a=20
techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity=
=20
supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have bee=
n=20
avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort towards=
=20
exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise=
,=20
the exhaustive 93-page report points out.

"I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared=
=20
the project minutes before it quit," says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan.=20


The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending=20
liberalisation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now=
=20
an established power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 199=
2,=20
Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to=
=20
set up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects=
.

Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed =
a=20
writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron.=
=20
The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal=
. =20
"Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very same=20
manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competitive=
=20
bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group studie=
d=20
the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepted by=
=20
Dabhol, is unprecedented." Says Chavan: "I would particularly like to=20
highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre=20
endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned."


Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,60=
7=20
crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of powe=
r=20
had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal, th=
e=20
payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first=20
year-and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtr=
a=20
exchequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabh=
ol=20
plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive=20
alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a=20
preliminary stage. The report notes: "...if the mseb had made efforts to=20
seriously pursue these projects, they might not have remained in their=20
preliminary stages". It adds that the members were of the opinion that "the=
=20
mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously, based on information=
=20
available at that time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor ev=
en=20
when its capacity was reduced." The failure seems to have been compounded b=
y=20
the laxity of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It=20
quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the=20
tariff reasonable, no further examination was required

Strangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with t=
he=20
BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea=
l.=20

After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi,=20
appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises,=20
actually managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained=20
inexplicable. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also sa=
id=20
that "since no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't=
=20
necessary." Says the committee: "This only adds strength to the suspicion=
=20
that the cea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all.=20
Indeed, given the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on=
=20
June 24, 1994, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated=20
December 23, 1994, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o=
f=20
dpc were discussed at all.''

The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously=20
questioned. "The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no=20
mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million=
=20
to $2,501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati=
ng=20
committee," the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: "It is strange=
=20
that the Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then=
=20
coolly renegotiated the deal." The committee further spells out the losses=
=20
incurred through the deal. "Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the=
=20
financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profi=
t=20
in 1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."=20

Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent=
=20
weaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, =
a=20
top bank official had said that "after a detailed review of the analytical=
=20
framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that=
=20
the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justified"=
=20
and that in "our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst=
em=20
in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic plant=
=20
dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be=20
replaced by the higher cost lng power."

Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged=
=20
from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian=20
official, Ajit Nimbalkar: "I recently met with the World Bank and have been=
=20
following the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank=20
opinion can be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the med=
ia=20
from here on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in=20
Washington."

The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like=20
Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the=
=20
first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability =
of=20
such a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the bette=
r=20
performing boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and=
=20
distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue=20
surpluses on an accrual basis.

Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's=20
industrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent=20
electrification. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. "Th=
is=20
improvement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation=20
undertaken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp=
c=20
was being considered," the report points out. Following a policy of=20
cross-subsidy, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.

But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn=
't=20
been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 1995-9=
6=20
to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly five-fol=
d=20
to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per uni=
t=01*
from 15 to 41 paise=01*an increase of 173 per cent. "The increase in the su=
bsidy=20
claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau=
se=20
of the increase in power purchase costs," says the committee, adding:=20
"Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb could be=20
financially healthy."

But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come=
=20
up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related=
=20
documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do=
wn=20
the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power=20
outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, a=

thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality only=

with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The questio=

MSEB revenue collections up at Rs 968 crore in March , Renni Abraham=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) revenue collections in Mar=

As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed=
=20
as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis, the state electricity=
=20
board has put matters relating to its performance on record. For instance,=
=20
MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31,=
=20
2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making=

it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power stations=

recorded the highest availability percentage at 86.1 up from 84.6 per cent=
=20
last fiscal. Plant load factor is up to 72.78 per cent, compared with 71.7=
=20
per cent in 2000.=20

The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten=
=20
years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligibl=
e=20
for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines=20

Vince/Stinson,

This is a summary fo the report submitted by the Godbole Committee appointed 
by the state government to review the Dabhol project.

The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff.  A lot of what they 
mention is something we won't agree to.  However, to me it seems apparent 
that this can be worked out.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: Request for visit and meeting

Hi Grant, we met briefly a couple of months ago. I work with Pedro in the 
Colombia office. We are working closely with Ecopetrol (Colombia's 
state-owned oil company) on a very important deal, and some of their highest 
ranking officials (3 of them) will like to visit our head quarters in early 
August, to share some ideas on risk management tools (very general concepts 
that can obviously be disclosed). 

My assumption is that Vince and your-self are the perfect people to have the 
meeting with. Several consulting firms have advice Ecopetrol to get in touch 
with Enron when referring to advance risk management techniques. Do you think 
this is possible? Please let me know, this means a great deal for this 
office, but I also know you guys are extremely busy. Thanks,

Carlos E

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS,April 23, 2001=20
Godbole's report unearths absurd calculations , Maharashtra could use this =
to wriggle out of the Dabhol project , Sucheta Dalal

It is finally Quit India time for Enron. Though the controversial multinati=
onal has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), info=
rmed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light & Power and others=
 to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the best cours=
e for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force m=
ajeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly=
 weaken its case. The committee points out that the many "infirmities" in t=
he DPC approval process brings into question the "propriety of the decision=
s".

 It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India's policy-mak=
ers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of techno-economic a=
ppraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts. The=
 committee says it is "troubled with the failure of governance that seems t=
o have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on ma=
tters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broad, across dif=
ferent governments at different points of time, at both the state and the c=
entral level, and across different agencies associated with examining the p=
roject and at both the administrative and political levels. It strains beli=
ef to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigne=
d responsibilities is purely co-incidental".

Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate=
 these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary i=
n the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry int=
o the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial in=
quiry would delay the negotiation process and "not serve any purpose". Ther=
e may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating=
 tariffs or facilitating Enron's exit, but the report certainly provides th=
e Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that it needs to =
start an investigation.

CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the d=
eal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the pol=
itical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the CVC=
 can establish whether there are lapses on the part of "government function=
aries including political executives" and ensure "appropriate action" again=
st them. If it is indeed able to establish "undue influence" in signing the=
 contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently again=
st the public interest without any monetary liability.

The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who =
have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that =
Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated,=
 regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MS=
EB) financial distress. Also that DPC's extortionate tariffs are not merely=
 because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, =
but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enr=
on's contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw mate=
rial (ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply e=
stimates and several legal requirements and permissions.

In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930=
 crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 25=
3 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per =
cent of the capacity is used for DPC. There's also a Rs 100 crore extra bil=
ling to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thes=
e facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging =
more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the governm=
ent of India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. I=
t has also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel co=
nsumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the power =
purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed=
 it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage oppor=
tunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra.=20

The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four differ=
ent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: a rate=
 of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan=
s, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dollar as=
 reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculating=
 Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges=
 has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough negoti=
ation and public pressure on the political establishment.=20

The Godbole committee has established that DPC's tariffs can easily be halv=
ed if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the doll=
arisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (which is=
 in fact hampering MSEB's reform particularly in power distribution) are sc=
rapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tariff=
 would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system=
. The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if =
the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it sh=
ould free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Mah=
arashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all pro=
jects negotiated by government: "The public has a right to know what is bei=
ng contracted on their behalf" and has recommended that all documents, incl=
uding contracts related to all Independent Power Projects (IPPs), particula=
rly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within two month=
s.

Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state governme=
nt were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations wi=
th power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption =
of power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations sh=
ould be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. Thi=
s should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance (Patalganga), Mittals (Bh=
adravati), the BSES (Saphale) and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra.

DPC board set to authorise president, Enron MD to issue notice of terminati=

Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement

The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has already tak=
en an aggressive posture, has proposed to authorise the Enron India managin=
g director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil =
McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement (=
PPA) and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the st=
ate and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).

The board of directors, which would meet on April 25 in London, also plans =
to appoint Mr Cline as its "true and lawful Attorney-in-fact" and authorise=
 him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts a=
nd financing agreements and their amendments and modifications.Top sources =
told The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline and/or Mr McGr=
egor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to t=
he state and Central governments and MSEB under clause 17 and schedule 11 o=
f the PPA.

"In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obligatio=
ns under the PPA, the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour ob=
ligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of th=
e Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee, th=
e company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conci=
liation and arbitration proceedings," the company resolution said. "Consist=
ent with this recourse to contractual remedies, the company now seeks the a=
uthority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices purs=
uant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the PPA from time to time and at any t=
ime upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such =
notices as determined by the company," the resolution added.

According to the resolution, the directors, the company secretary and offic=
ers of the company and each of them acting individually, are authorised and=
 empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take s=
uch other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution,=
 in the name and for and on behalf of the company. Against this backdrop, t=
he state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issui=
ng termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual ob=
ligations under the PPA. The state government and MSEB sources said that su=
ch a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate (pen=
alty) of Rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of=
 power on January 28 and February 13.

The state government and MSEB, which reviewed its position on Saturday at a=
 meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, are of the view =
that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio=
n notice to the DPC. The DPC's move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its "true=
 and lawful Attorney-in-fact" deserves importance especially when the state=
 government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit =
cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit=
 states.

Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out =
or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the=
 ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs 64 crore or the equivalent in fore=
ign currency in any financial year. Furthermore, Mr Cline would be in a pos=
ition to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relati=
ng to the day-to-day operation of the company's business or exercise its ri=
ghts and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the fina=
ncing agreements

DPC seeks OK to exit power project , Tamal Bandyopadhyay & S Ravindran=20

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is seeking the approval of it=
s 25 lenders to pull the plug on the $3 billion power project in Maharashtr=
a tomorrow (April 23).The meeting has been convened in London at the initia=
tive of the company. The meeting is crucial as the DPC board is meeting on =
April 25 in London to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to =
the Maharshtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).
=20
DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders.=
 While bankers said the lenders' meeting is about the second phase of the p=
roject, which is still under construction, state government officials clari=
fied that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project, =
the lenders' decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also. The =
second phase of the project involves 1,444 MW generation capacity, whereas =
Phase I of 740 MW is already operational."According to the loan agreement, =
even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract t=
hen DPC can do so," highly placed sources in the lenders' consortium said f=
rom London.=20

This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a p=
reliminary termination notice.Following the notice, there is a cooling off =
period of six months for both parties (the MSEB and DPC) to find a mutually=
 acceptable solution, which may take the form of a re-negotiated PPA, sourc=

Enron winding up operations in India?=20

Marred by controversies since inception, the US-based energy major Enron-pr=
omoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) board will meet this Wednesday, April 25,=
 in London to decide the fate of its 2,184 MW project in Dabhol, including =
winding up of its operations. "The top most item on the agenda is to empowe=
r DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up operations in the country,=
" state government sources told PTI on Saturday. When contacted, DPC spokes=
person declined to comment on the agenda of the London meeting and added, "=
I will not like to comment on speculations."=20

Sources said a team comprising three top officials of Maharashtra State Ele=
ctricity Board (MSEB) including chairman Vinay Bansal would attend the high=
-profile board meet. Bansal told PTI that MSEB has decided to give a "fitti=
ng reply" and present its case concerning the Rs. 401 crore penalty that th=
e loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating requi=
red power within the stipulated time as per the Power Purchase Agreement (P=
PA).=20

This London meet comes two days after the international and domestic financ=
ial institutions sit together (April 23) to discuss DPC's future course of =
action in the wake of non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs. 223 crore by M=
SEB and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty.Over the payment of=
 dues of December 2000 and January of Rs. 102 crore and Rs. 111 crore respe=
ctively, sources said, both the state government and MSEB had offered to ma=
ke a "protest" payment as per the PPA, but DPC, India's first fasttrack pow=
er project, refused to accept on that condition.=20

Currently, Enron India holds 65 per cent in the US $900 million DPC project=
, which includes MSEB's 15 per cent while General Electric and Bechtel hold=
 10 per cent each. The controversial "now on now off" project began in 1992=
 but ran into rough weather after the Shiv Sena-BJP came to power and was s=
crapped only to be revived after renegotiating the PPA. Fresh trouble arose=
 in October last when MSEB began defaulting over the "enormous" billing fol=
lowing which DPC invoked the state and centre's counter guarantee and also =
recently sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the polit=
ical "forced majeure" implying inability to conform towards any financial c=
ommitment.
=20
DPC had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50 =
per cent but according to Enron Corp's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skillin=
g the company would be interested in talking to potential buyers for its st=
ake. Skilling, according to an international financial daily, said the mult=

State for consolidating all DPC arbitration notices, Sanjay Jog  =20

The Maharashtra government has decided to appeal to the Centre for consolid=
ating all arbitration notices served DPC for the "continuous default of con=

ster Vilasrao Deshmukh, at its meeting with the union finance minister Yash=
want Sinha and union power minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday, also proposes =
for the appointment of a non-Indian arbitrator with a view to cutting the c=
ost substantially.

During arbitration proceedings initiated by the DPC after the repudiation o=
f Dabhol phase-I by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995, a non-In=
dian arbitrator, Mr Kumara Swami was appointed as an arbitrator after a sug=
gestion by a senior counsel Fali Nariman. State government sources told The=

ation proceedings after Monday's meetings. The state advocate general Goola=
m Wahanwati will be suggesting a suitable arbitrator for the state and cent=

The advocate general will also suggest solicitors and Queens Counsel, who m=

marred 2,184-mw project in Dabhol.=20

Moreover, the DPC board is also scheduled to meet on April 25 in London to =

--Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole

This could well be the real Enron story
A five-member high-powered committee headed by Madhav Godbole-and including=
 former Union economic affairs secretary E.A.S. Sarma, hdfc chairman Deepak=
 Parekh, teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official=
 Vinay Mohan Lal-has recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron pow=

"The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every s=

An investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three governme=
nts The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron=
 to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to the co=
mmittee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and sta=
te, and across different agencies. "It strains belief to accept that such w=
idespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coin=
cidental," the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implemented i=
f something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also felt=
 that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to o=
rder a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress le=
ader: "Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra a=
nd put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector."

The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: "If the Enr=

 having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing i=
s to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it'=
s not an issue of corruption but that of perception."=20

Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the=
 Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was=
 cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Re=
ddy: "Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over Tehel=
ka." Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting coul=
d send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from Maharashtr=
a, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted with the expr=
ess purpose of politicising the Enron issue. "I think I know Vilasrao Deshm=
ukh's gameplan," says an MP from the state. But some MPs like Congress' Pri=
thviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy that's surrounded the deal: "I=
've maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examin=
e this".

The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to=
 a techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electric=
ity supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have=
 been avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort to=
wards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to=
 arise, the exhaustive 93-page report points out.

"I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared =
the project minutes before it quit," says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan.=20


The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberal=
isation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now an est=
ablished power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 1992, Enr=
on signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to set=
 up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects.

Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed =
a writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron=
. The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated de=
al.  "Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very sam=
e manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competiti=
ve bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group stu=
died the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepte=
d by Dabhol, is unprecedented." Says Chavan: "I would particularly like to =
highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre end=
orsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned."


Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,60=
7 crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of po=
wer had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal=
, the payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first year=
-and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtra ex=
chequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabh=
ol plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive al=
ternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a preliminar=
y stage. The report notes: "...if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pu=
rsue these projects, they might not have remained in their preliminary stag=
es". It adds that the members were of the opinion that "the mseb and the Ma=
harashtra government erred seriously, based on information available at tha=
t time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor even when its capa=
city was reduced." The failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity =
of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It quotes the ce=
a as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonab=
le, no further examination was required

Strangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with t=
he BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the =
deal.=20

After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi, ap=
pointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises, actu=
ally managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained inexplicabl=
e. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also said that "si=
nce no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't necessary=
." Says the committee: "This only adds strength to the suspicion that the c=
ea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all. Indeed, give=
n the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on June 24, 19=
94, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December 23, 199=
4, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discu=
ssed at all.''

The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously question=
ed. "The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no mention of =
any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million to $2,501 =
million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committ=
ee," the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: "It is strange that t=
he Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly=
 renegotiated the deal." The committee further spells out the losses incurr=
ed through the deal. "Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the finan=
cial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profit in =
1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."=20

Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent w=
eaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, a=
 top bank official had said that "after a detailed review of the analytical=
 framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion tha=
t the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justifie=
d" and that in "our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb s=
ystem in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic =
plant dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be=
 replaced by the higher cost lng power."

Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged =
from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian offici=
al, Ajit Nimbalkar: "I recently met with the World Bank and have been follo=
wing the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank opinion c=
an be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the media from h=
ere on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington=
."

The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Mahara=
shtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the first =
time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of suc=
h a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the better p=
erforming boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and =
distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue sur=
pluses on an accrual basis.

Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's in=
dustrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electri=
fication. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. "This impr=
ovement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation underta=
ken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was b=
eing considered," the report points out. Following a policy of cross-subsid=
y, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.

But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn=
't been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 199=
5-96 to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly fiv=
e-fold to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise =
per unit-from 15 to 41 paise-an increase of 173 per cent. "The increase in =
the subsidy claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap princ=
ipally because of the increase in power purchase costs," says the committee=
, adding: "Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb c=
ould be financially healthy."

But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come=
 up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related =
documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do=
wn the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power =
outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, a=
nd thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality on=
ly with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The ques=
tion is, can that be achieved in an unstable political environment?

MSEB revenue collections up at Rs 968 crore in March , Renni Abraham=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) revenue collections in Mar=

As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed=

MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31, =
2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making=
 it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power station=

7 per cent in 2000.=20

The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten=
 years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligib=

Vince, 

I was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to Jeff Shankman 
about, in the Dabhol LNG context.  It occurred to me that one way to collect 
on regas charges, and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the 
railways.

Some time back, I had looked into the possiblility of transporting LNG by 
train.  Apparently, technology exists wherein LNG can be put into cryogenic 
containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded 
from trucks to train bogies.  I believe this maybe a way to earn some monies 
with LNG by developing just such a market in India for Commercial customers.

It is pertinent to note that the Konkan Rail line is just about 1 hr. 45 
minutes from the Dabhol plant.  Trucks from Dabhol could carry LNG to the 
rail line at Guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of 
India.  If we target end-consumers directly, we could easily sell at retail 
type prices, and build in a large margin, even if the volumes disposed are 
relatively smaller.  (The alternative fuel for most of these establishments 
is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced, and mostly trucked along 
roads,increasing costs).  The end aim is to keep income targets in India, so 
that the Analysts do not have a field day with the stock.

Hence keeping activity up in India, and showing that solutions exist, will 
keep stock price buoyed.  We could explore this idea if it appeals!

Regards,
Sandeep.

I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose
to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I 
did not meet him and could not
form my judgment based on personal observations.

However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey

I think we can skip the meeting and discuss any issues between us.
The meeting was convened at the request of Doug Arnell, but Jeff
Shankman thinks that there is no need for formal meetings: we can
ask them for the information directly on as needed basis.

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

Vince,

My name is Jeanne Anne Klein and I am a financial modeler working with 
Mingcheng Lian on a high profile pipeline project in China. 

Zimin Lu referred us to you regarding questions we have on the Real Option 
Valuation Approach.  We are very enthusiastic about what we have read and 
heard about this valuation method.

We have been doing some preliminary research on the Real Option Valuation 
approach and believe that integrating this approach into our financial model 
would bring a significant increase to the value to the project.   We have 
identified some deal aspects we believe would be ideal to valuate as real 
options.  Our goal is to work with the development team to structure the deal 
to incorporate the Real Option Valuation approach into the model enabling us 
to arrange the contracts within the deal to optimize the project's value.

We would like to arrange a meeting with you at your ealiest convenience to 
brainstorm on additional deal aspects that can be valued using the real 
option approach as well as on ways to quantify these aspects using the Real 
Option valuation Method. 

Please advise if you will be able to meet with us within the next week or 
two.

Vince,

Please see below some of the ideas being bounced, FYI.  Please keep this 
confidential.

The unused capacity in Maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis, 
ON BEHALF OF MSEB to any customers outside MSEB's current purview.  I would 
like us to look at the whole issue as one of MSEB's poor credit, and hence ( 
as Jeff pointed out on the call), one where we need to identify all deep 
pockets in and out of Maharashtra.
Secondly, there is (as Shubh and I had pointed out) the ability to evacuate 
about 700-1000 MW to customers other than MSEB.  The challege is - at what 
price, and in coordination with which agencies.  As always, in India your 
greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt. agencies.  
Another point to consider is that in-all we have about 5-7 customers 
identified.  Will all the customers we have earmarked bite ???  This is the 
reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10-15 
day power on the screens of the different SEBs we can connect up with.  This 
also substantially gets around the credit quality issue, as this would be an 
arrangement akin to cash-and-carry.  I see a lot of hope for such a 
strategy.  I do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power 
to either NTPC or PTC.  I would agree however, that we not put all our eggs 
in one basket, and hence you could designate a team to look into the NTPC 
sale issue inparallel.
In order to set up the trading sytems, however, we need to start by the end 
of Q1 2001, and just start doing small deals where we break even, simply to 
test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market.
Hand-in-hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy, as I have 
been pushing for.  For this to happen, we need to get the Special Import 
Licence reinstated.  If that is not possible, we need to lobby with the 
highest authorities within govt. and RBi to allow for hedging, irrespective 
of whether we have an SIL.  The discussions being held with IOC are therefore 
very important in this regard, and I am going to get Anshuman and Mukesh 
involved with the same.
Finally, I do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ENE management 
for $75 Million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory 
framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the 
generation side of the equation.  I would refrain from stating this in any 
senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the 
cost-benefit of this.  I have some ideas on that side which I need to develop 
further.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Rebecca,

I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose
to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I 
did not meet him and could not
form my judgment based on personal observations.

However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey
to you and not to act upon.

I can appreciate and share your objective.  Earlier today I sent a separate 
note to Vince forwarding your concerns and asking again for his assistance.  
I'll start there and if needed I'll contact Michael Popkin's structuring 
group.  However, before getting too many people involved I want to see what 
feedback we get from Cairn after they've discussed the offers internally this 
week.

I gave you several clear alternatives such as contacting Vince's structuring 
group, Michael Popkin's Southern Cone structuring group and a long discussion 
regarding the pricing and suggested "collar." I also asked if you had spoken 
to your customer about what they were willing to pay, but that was a non 
starter. Trust me, I have seen almost every bad deal Enron has entered into 
or attempted to enter into and I am trying to get Metgas to objectively 
relook at their offer to Cairn become it becomes another bad deal.

I talked to Vince after we hung up and his only suggestion was to call 
Sandeep Kohli.  I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over 
a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after 
discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears 
to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed 
ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous 
variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better 
deal, please advise.

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

Vince,

I'm following up on our conversation late last week and I'm interested to see 
what your group can advise, per Doug Leach's recommendation.  As you can see 
he is raising a major red flag in regards to our non-binding offer to Cairn.  
Since, it was late the other night I didn't touch base with Sandeep Kohli, 
but Bobby and I are probably the most knowledgeable in regards to the Indian 
gas market.  Please let me know what information you may need from us to 
provide some guidance.

Regards,
Doug

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.

As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden deat=

At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initiall=

the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to=

The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC=

DPC board empowers MD to cancel MSEB contract

THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho=
l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to=
 the Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders t=
o the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed wi=
th the MSEB.
The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue "notice =
of termination on the contract to sell 740 MW of power" was taken after the=
 board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested p=
arty. The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposi=
tion vote was cast by IDBI, sources said.=20

According to reports, financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank, C=
redit Suisse First Boston, Citibank, ABN-Amro and the State Bank of India h=
ave on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB. MSEB =
chairman Vinay Bansal, who with two other directors attended the meeting on=
 Wednesday representing Maharashtra's 15 per cent stake in the near $3-bill=
ion project, said: "The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate =
if Enron broke the contract." While Bansal declined comment on the board de=
cision, the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to hold=
s talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were pos=
sibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the =
state. (PTI)


THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday Apr 27 2001
MSEB pays Rs 134cr under 'protest' to DPC

 DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head, M=
aharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a "protest payment" of =
Rs 134 crore disputed amount, towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to Dabh=
ol. "We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself, but DPC officials =
could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh", a senior MSEB off=
icial said. "We have disputed payment of Rs 12.64 crore and it would be now=
 taken up at the disputes resolution forum, of which Enron India managing d=
irector K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members", MSEB sources said.=20

Last week, DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th=
at it would not accept "protest payments" anymore. Cline had said the energ=
y major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums, which MSE=
B in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise th=
e "purported protest or reservation". MSEB had paid a Rs 113.5 crore Februa=
ry bill in protest last month. On April 23 last, both domestic and internat=
ional lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the =

ment. (PTI)=20

BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, April 27, 001
Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPA

The board of the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), at its meeting =
in London on Wednesday, authorised the managing director of Enron India to =
issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharash=
tra State Electricity Board and the state government. "The board has author=
ised Wade Cline to serve the termination notice. However, this does not mea=
n that the termination notice will be served immediately. It is only an ena=
bling provision and will be used only if the situation arises," a state gov=
ernment source told Business Standard from London. He said DPC was under pr=
essure from its lenders.=20
The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue. The hardening of=
 the board's stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPC's lenders, who=
 had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notic=
e. The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need =
not be served at this stage. Serving of the notice requires a nod from the =
lenders, who have an exposure of about $2 billion in the project. Sources s=
aid given the lenders' strong opposition to termination of the contract, th=
e Enron board's "enabling resolution" did not have much significance beyond=
 conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio. T=
he Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process o=
f crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice. The state government i=
s to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contra=
ct.=20
Enron holds 65 per cent in DPC, while US-based GE and Bechtel hold 10 per c=
ent each. The balance 15 per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpose=
 vehicle, Maharashtra Power Development Corporation. The MSEB representativ=
es were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested pa=
rty. The IDBI representative protested against the board's decision. The me=
eting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal. The meeting was held a=
gainst the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills=
.=20
After MSEB failed to pay Rs 102 crore towards the December 2000 bill, DPC i=
nvoked the state government's guarantee and then the Union government's cou=
nter guarantee. When payment of the Rs 127-crore January bill became overdu=
e, DPC again invoked the state government's guarantee. MSEB retaliated on J=
anuary 28, 2001 by slapping a Rs 401-crore penalty for non-supply of electr=
icity at adequate levels. It demanded that DPC adjust the bills against thi=
s penalty. "This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting", =
a state government official said. The Centre also supported MSEB's stand an=
d refused to honour the counter guarantee. The power company then invoked t=
he political force majeure clause. A process of conciliation and arbitratio=
n between the Centre and DPC is currently on.=20
THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, April 27, 2001
Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC , Sanjay Jog & Raghu Mo=
han
Global banks comfortable with Enron pull-out
Lenders to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are a sharply divided lot. Intern=
ational lenders, in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by=
 the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India (IDBI), are categorical that a=
dditional assistance to DPC's phase-II will be held in abeyance despite the=
 completion of 92 per cent of the project work.The stage is also set for a =
preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board (MSEB) within the next four weeks.This follows the autho=
risation given to Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline and DPC pres=
ident & CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice, and transfer not=
ices to MSEB, following Wednesday's DPC board meeting in London.
The essence of the message from the international lenders following the Lon=
don meeting with DPC board is: Emotions do not work. Contractual obligation=
s and payments have to be met. We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to=
 meet its obligations. There is no point in Enron continuing with the proje=
ct and the company should get out of it.The structuring of DPC's debt has c=
reated two classes of lenders. In phase-I, international lenders are covere=
d by a sovereign guarantee while in phase-II, no lender is. However, all le=
nders have a parri passu charge, making attachment of assets a messy affair=
.
Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t=
o phase-II of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect =
their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets -=
 like a sovereign cover. "It was this desperation that made local lenders l=
ike IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to 16.5 per cent from 2=
1.5 per cent," a leading foreign banker pointed out.Three points that were =
made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were=
: a) there are contractual obligations b) MSEB was not punctual in its paym=
ents to DPC and c) MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs=
 401 crore rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the avail=
ability of power.
While local lenders led by IDBI - with MSEB parroting the same - were of th=
e view that the current situation is a temporary one, international lenders=
 were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out. This i=
s despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminat=
ion given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for. International ban=
kers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges an=
d protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapp=
ed in its present form.The points of contention are: a) that phase-I of DPC=
 is backed by a sovereign guarantee b) phase-II is not and c) to the extent=
 that phase-II is covered by assets, cancellation of phase-II may see all a=
ssets - even those under phase-I - getting attached. Therefore, an examinat=
ion on the segregation of assets under phase-I and phase-II is now warrante=
d.
PTI adds: In a significant move, DPC board has empowered its management to =
sever power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could inflict a financi=
al liability of about Rs 2840 crore on the Centre. A decision to authorise =
DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale =

Enron: Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB

THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company, a subsidiary of Houston-based Enron Corp=
, has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) that i=
t intends to pull the plug on its Guhagar-based project.In a board meeting =
held in London on Wednesday, the board decided to authorise DPC President a=
nd CEO Neil McGregor and Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline to se=
rve a ''preliminary'' termination notice for sale of power to the MSEB with=
in the next four weeks.The Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since =
MSEB began missing payments last year. MSEB owes Dabhol Power $48 million f=
or power delivered in December and January. The payment ran into a dispute =
after MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs 401 crore on DPC for its failure t=
o supply power within three hours of the demand being placed.But MSEB has p=
aid $24 million for February. And a payment of $31 million was made for Mar=
ch on Thursday.
The $3 billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind=
ia to date. Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol =
to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes.While a preliminary=
 termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead=
 to the abandonment of the project by Enron, analysts have described the de=
cision as a ''procedural'' move consistent with DPC's negotiating strategy =
to recover overdue payments from the MSEB.
After the company issues the preliminary termination notice, step two would=
 be an official termination notice, and step three would be a notice that t=
he company is surrendering control of the project. If the project is termin=
ated, the government of India will have to take a hit of $300 million besid=
es paying bills of Rs 1,500 crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty=
. ''Our (Centre's) liability, if Dabhol power project is terminated, would =
be one year's electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million,'' Pow=
er Secretary A K Basu said.''Contractually, the Centre will have to pay one=
 year's electricity bill, totalling at present prices about Rs 1,400-1,500 =
crore, and take over DPC's debt, which stands at around $300 million, if th=
e project was terminated,'' Basu said in Delhi. Dabhol Power is in the proc=
ess of completing the second phase of the 2,184-megawatt power-plant projec=
t, which is 95 per cent through.
While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company=
 to get out of the project, Indian lenders, led by IDBI, are asking the com=
pany to reconsider its decision on its termination notice. During the meeti=
ng in London, MSEB which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project, had stro=
ngly opposed DPC's move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue notices fo=
r termination.
MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar - both dire=
ctors on the DPC board - and the state principal secretary (energy) VM Lal,=
 an invitee to the board, raised the issue at the board meeting in London. =
MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly ''threatening'' to issue various arbit=
ration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolation.In =
recent weeks, Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the MSEB, deliv=
ering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra - a step typically=
 invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war, coup, o=
r a similar radical political event. In this case, DPC's move was viewed as=
 a threat to stop providing electricity.DPC has come under fire because of =
the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to the company chargi=
ng Rs 7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with around Rs 1.5 a kilo=
watt-hour charged by other suppliers.
THE HINDU, Friday, April 27, 2001
Offer of renegotiation 'too late': Enron, By Mahesh Vijapurkar=20
MUMBAI, APRIL 26. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, which last nigh=
t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its P=
ower Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,=
 has decided to keep a stiff upper lip. This, in turn, has stoked speculati=
on that the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent, whi=
le in reality, a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within =
the PPA.=20
As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden deat=
h of the project'' and in all probability, the DPC, vexed with the developm=
ents, including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee, ha=
s chosen to only arm itself with a serious option. ``This would only eventu=
ally come into effect. It is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal =
work is involved''. Apparently, the DPC intends to do some arm-twisting.=20
At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initiall=
y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contenti=
ons on the project, the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board th=
at the offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late''. It also said it=
 did not see any room for optimism about the outcome. It did not, however, =
rule out the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the de=
cision to authorise termination was a new weapon.=20
The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC w=
ould not take any ``harsh step'' which would cause lot of damage to the int=
erests of both the independent power producer and the Government and today =
he expressed his dismay. In fact, the mandate of the team that went, on the=
 strength of its stake in the DPC, was to put across the idea that negotiat=
ion was the requirement and not confrontation.=20
Echo in LS=20
The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister=
, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Ce=
ntre Rs. 2,840 crores, whose liability in the project agreement was limited=
. The Centre's liability in case of termination is one year's electricity b=
ill and a termination fee of $300 million.=20
Blow to FIs=20
The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial In=
stitutions (FIs) which, under the leadership of the IDBI, were trying to co=
nvince the other lenders of the project against the notice. The exposure of=
 Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee=
 either of the Centre or the State.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday ,27 April 2001
Enron ready to pull out, but lenders say wait=20

The Dabhol Power Company board, which met on Wednesday in London, authorise=
d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board. The company, however, may not pull out of the proje=
ct yet, considering its lenders, who met on Monday, opposed such a move and=
 favoured renegotiations. Sources present during both the meetings said tha=
t though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue, domestic=
 financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, p=
revailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move. Enron need=
s the lenders' consent to file a pre-termination notice for pulling out fro=
m the project. The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a term=
ination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vot=
e against such a move.=20
Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the =
financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th=
e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanism=
s. Institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned pac=
kage, which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project. ``The=
 board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pre-termination notice. Bu=
t the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to termina=
te the project but to initiate serious re-negotiation proceedings,'' said M=
SEB Chairman Vinay Bansal, who attended the board meeting. ``MSEB presented=
 their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also=
 included the Rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration p=
roceedings. ``We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron=
 is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable," Bansal a=
dded.=20
``They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our expo=
sure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans=
 in that direction,'' said a top banker who was present during the lenders'=
 meet. ``There is a general consensus that the project must be completed an=
d the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance,'' he added.=
 The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank, Credit Suiss=
e First Boston, ABN-AMRO, Citibank and the State Bank of India, where all t=
hese parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials. Howeve=
r, some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one =
lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proce=
edings.=20
Meanwhile, in a clear reversal of roles, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra=
o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the P=
PA. ``We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since th=
at would be bad news for all of us, including DPC,'' Deshmukh said. Deshmuk=
h was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu's sentiments, who said tha=
t the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row. He, howe=
ver, added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investmen=
ts, and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $2.9 billion pro=
ject would be a blow to India's efforts to woo foreign investors.=20
The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three=
 arbitration notices on the state government over non-payment of dues amoun=
ting to Rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for December 2000 a=
nd January 2001. Meanwhile, MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bi=
lls amounting to Rs 134 crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment, desp=
ite the dispute over the amount.=20
When asked on the future course of action, Bansal said it was up to the DPC=
.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, April 27, 2001
DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice=20
THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has authorised the Man=
aging Director, Mr Neil McGregor, to issue the notice of intent to terminat=
e its power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity=
 Board (MSEB) ``at an appropriate time''. The decision was taken at a board=
 meeting held in London yesterday. ``While MSEB, which is an `interested pa=
rty', was not allowed to vote, it made a presentation clarifying its stand =
on the matter,'' a senior State Government official said.=20
The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice =
was carried by six votes to one. IDBI voted against the decision, the offic=
ial said. The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a =
six-month ``suspension period''. According to clause 17.8 of the Terminatio=
n Procedure, of the PPA: ``Following the giving of a preliminary terminatio=
n notice, the parties shall consult for a period of six months (or such lon=
ger period as they may agree) as to what step shall be taken with a view to=
 mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the=
 circumstances...''=20
IDBI and State Bank of India, the principal Indian lenders, had earlier per=
suaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice=
 for some more time. At least one lender has to consent for the company to =
serve termination notice. It is understood that overseas lenders are in fav=
our of termination of the project and are prepared to consent. However, dom=
estic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PPA i=
s abandoned mid-way.=20
According to institutional sources, Indian lenders are trying to get all th=
e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues. The Maharashtra and C=
entral Governments too are in favour of a conciliation. Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk=
h, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, yesterday went on record that the State d=
id not want the project terminated. Mr Yashwant Sinha, Union Finance Minist=
er, is also understood to be of the same opinion. ``The DPC will now have t=
o decide what is the `appropriate time' to serve the notice,'' the official=
 said. MSEB pays Rs 134 crore: Meanwhile, MSEB has paid DPC Rs 134 crore to=
wards its March 2001 bill. MSEB officials confirmed that the bill was paid =
`in protest'' today morning. ``They (DPC) had billed us for an amount of Rs=
 146 crore. We do not agree with some of the items included,'' a senior MSE=
B official said.=20
THE PIONEER, Friday, April 27, 2001
Enron testing Maharashtra's nerves, T N Raghunatha
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht=
ra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Maharashtra State Government and the=
 Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them, if t=
he DPC Board of Directors' decision to authorise its managing director to s=
erve a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication.
The DPC Board, in its meeting in London on Wednesday, empowered the company=
 management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that coul=
d inflict a financial liability of Rs 2,840 crore on the Centre. The decisi=
on to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB wa=
s taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representa=
tives were prevented from voting on the ground of "interested party".
When contacted, the company's Mumbai-based spokesperson, Mr Jimmy Mogal, de=
clined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Board.=
 "We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London. We will expr=
ess our views after a few days," he said. However, Maharashtra Chief Minist=
er Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC board's decision as "unfort=
unate". "We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decisi=
on", Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai.=20
Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Board's d=
ecision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the =
MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay. Through it=
s tough posture, the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can =
formally agree for re-negotiations with the MSEB, the Centre and the State =
Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State elect=
ricity board. The sources said that the DPC's reported decision to authoris=
e its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean=
 that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of th=
e power contract with the MSEB.
"If anything, the DPC's reported decision is to mount additional pressure o=
n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronge=
r position in settling its dispute with the MSEB. As part of its plan to ar=
m itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its =
control, the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB,=
 the Centre and the State Government," the sources said.Not surprisingly, t=
he DPC's London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Government's=
 decision to set up a high-level committee, comprising representatives of t=
he MSEB, the Centre and the State Government to re-negotiate with the Enron=
's subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State =
electricity board.Meanwhile, amidst the threat of a possible termination no=
tice hanging on its head, the MSEB on Thursday made a "protest payment" of =
the Rs 134 crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to D=
PC.

ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER =20

Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy-ridden Dabh=
ol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the company's board to s=
top sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).=20
The meeting of the company, of which the Houston-based energy giant holds 6=
5 per cent and the MSEB 15 per cent, was attended by state energy secretary=
 V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its =
lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination.The Centre's =
liability, if Enron decides to snap the agreement, will be a year's power b=
ill and a termination fee of $ 300 million. However, the company will have =
to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls th=
e plug.The Centre shrugged off the move, saying there would not be any adve=
rse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out. "We do not se=
e FDI inflows into the power sector being hit," power minister Suresh Prabh=
u said.MSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC, which said =
its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board me=
etings. The decision coincided with a Rs 134-crore 'protest payment' by the=
 cash-strapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs 146.64 crore.
There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper=
s at Enron's hub in Houston, and because it was rattled by the sudden turn =
of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head.=
 MSEB officials brushed away the allusions, saying the cheque was ready on =
Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the state-wide ban=
dh. "We have a disputed payment of Rs 12.64 crore, which will be taken up a=
t the dispute-resolution forum," a board official said. Last week, DPC told=
 the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments i=
n a move to fortify its legal position.=20
MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric, the other partners who hol=
d around 20 per cent in DPC, are willing to go along with Enron Corp in ter=
minating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game beca=
use it puts their loans at risk. Investments made by Indian institutions ar=
e not covered under the Centre's and state's counter-guarantees, unlike tho=
se made by international lenders.Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmu=
kh called Enron's decision unfortunate. "We had told state government offic=
ials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up =
its operations in the state as it will harm both parties."
THE STATESMAN, Friday, April 27, 2001
Enron threatens to pull out
=20
 The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power =
Company deciding to authorise the managing director, Mr K Wade Cline, to se=
rve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $2.9=
 billion power project.The decision, which could lead to the cessation of D=
abhol's power supply to the state, was taken at the meeting held yesterday =
in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat=
e Electricity Board, Mr Vinay Bansal.=20
While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything, it is learnt that MSEB w=
as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days bef=
ore the meeting.MSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Con=
gress Party president, Mr Sharad Pawar, and union power minister Mr Suresh =
Prabhu, who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister, Mr =
Vilasrao Deshmukh, and an MSEB delegation last Monday.
The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent=
re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its c=
ounter-guarantee.Further, the DPC has already slapped a notice of political=
 force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event=
 of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step.The union power minist=
er, Mr Suresh Prabhu, contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only 0.=
7 per cent of the total energy output of the country, its termination would=
 not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation.=20
However, if terminations proceedings go through, Enron Corp, a 65 per cent =
share-holder in the Dabhol Power Company, would stand to net a hefty amount=
 in damages. The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termi=
nation of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs 1,800 crore, which is the total =
of one years' electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million. Accor=
ding to an energy analyst, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, the total liability would not=
 cross Rs 350 crore. However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the=
 that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs 2,840 crore.It is=
 learnt that on 20 April, Mr Deshmukh had given the go-ahead to the MSEB to=
 prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC=
's Board of Directors on Wednesday. At the meeting, the energy minister, Pa=
damsinh Patil, energy secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vi=
nay Bansal, were also present.The notice was prepared over the past weekend=
 and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on 24 April. How=
ever, the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough, given =
its huge stake in the project, and that such a notice would not be necessar=
y. The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff=
, with Enron's consent.
Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal, Mr Bansal and MSEB t=
echnical director, Mr P Paunikar, in their capacity as directors. However, =
they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party. The =
only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also rep=
resented on the board, it is learnt.The chief minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk=
h, said the state was not in favour of terminating the project. This could =
mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm-twist the Indian authorities could ac=
hieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past=
 three months cleared.The MSEB owes Enron Rs 146.64 crore for March 2001 an=
d Rs 229 crore for December 2000 and January 2001.The Centre today put up a=
 brave face on Enron's decision saying there would not be any adverse effec=
t on foreign investment in power sector in the country, PTI reported from N=
ew Delhi.
"There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic =
or foreign company. As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse imp=
act on FDI in power sector," Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters wh=
en asked about DPC's decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio=
n notice to MSEB.Emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decisio=
n, Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affai=
rs "we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a=
s European nations in the power sector."In fact not only the Power Minister=
 but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on =
power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector."

'DPC may not wind up'
Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego=
r, managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC), has been given =
complete powers with regard to DPC's operations in the state, including the=
 authority to wind up operations, it does not necessarily mean that McGrego=
r will issue such a termination notice. McGregor was given the powers at a =
meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday. Ranganathan said that stat=
e officials, including Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman =
Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal, have reported back to him about t=
he meeting in London.
With regard to the state's failure to pay Enron, Ranganathan said, " Bills =
are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and DPC owes some mo=
ney to us. Our people informed Enron officials about this.. In fact, there =
was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination notice."In the=
 London meeting, MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) repre=
sentatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs 411 crore since it could not s=
upply power whenever needed.=20
Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the deci=
sion of the board of the Enron-promoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind=
 up operations. Deshmukh added, " We have already requested Enron not to ta=
ke any harsh decision."Deshmukh had earlier said, " We have directed state =
Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy c=
ompany from winding up operations in the state, as it would be harmful to b=

Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue. McGregor said, " I am not goi=

Enron offers 'no comment' on renegotiation, H S Rao
A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company (DP=
C), promoted by the US energy major Enron, was held here yesterday apparent=
ly to discuss fate of its $900-million power project in Maharashtra, but th=
ere was no official word on the Indian and state Governments' decision to r=
enegotiate the contract.=20
An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting, sayi=
ng the issues discussed at the meeting were 'confidential' . " We have not =
received any direct communication. Unless we get it and evaluate the detail=
s, we have no comments to make," the spokesman said when asked about the pr=
oposed decision on re-negotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) has 15 per cent stake.
Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Dir=
ector Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India, the spokesman said =
he had nothing to say on them. Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to =
look at various options including selling the company's stake in DPC. Mahar=

the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow, at the most.H=

 'ENRON'S ON!'=20
State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz=20
The US power giant, Enron Power Corporation's willingness to wrap up the Da=
bhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise, thoug=
h the Dabhol Power Company chief, Mr. Wade Cline, has been authorised to do=
 so, since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the mat=
ter.=20
Disclosing this, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th=
at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the p=
ower project at Dabhol could be continued, and at the same time Enron did n=
ot feel slighted. "Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision. We=
 are waiting for their letter," he said. When asked what sort of compromise=
 the state government plans to forge, Mr. Deshmukh said, "Let our officers =
come back. After that we will decide a future course of action. But we are =
definitely going in for renegotiation of the project. It is very difficult =
to predict the outcome of Enron's decision but as of now the project is sti=
ll on." When asked whether the project could be moved to another state, if =
wound up from Maharashtra, Mr. Deshmukh said, that was not possible as per =
the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government.=
 However, it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself,=
 he indicated. He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable =
losses if the project was terminated.=20
The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company, which met in London on =
Wednesday, decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje=
ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project, i=
f he deemed it fit. However, this decision, as of now, does not necessarily=
 indicate the death knell for the project. The Enron project, which had bee=
n riddled with controversies right from its inception, had been a pretext f=
or the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from ti=
me to time. The previous Sena-BJP government, which had been out to termina=
te the project, however, chose to continue with it following renegotiations=
 with Enron's top visiting officials like Ms. Rebecca Mark. And, the Democr=
atic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governme=
nts changed hands a year and a half ago.=20
Meanwhile, State Energy Minister Dr. Padamsinh Patil, when contacted at the=
 Osmanabad Circuit House, said the state government and the central governm=

Vince/Stinson,

I met with Rebecca McDonald, and introduced her to Mr. Sud on Saturday.

The meeting went on quite well, and Mr. Sud repeated the point he had made to 
me regarding NTPC buying the power.  He did not ask for any consulting or 
other contract, but said that he would try to help.  

Rebecca seemed happy with the meeting, but I do not know whether she has a 
plan in mind going forward.

I can give you more details of the meeting if anyone is interested.  I do 
believe that Mr. Sud is well connected in India.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Vince and Grant,

First let me apologize for cancelling our meeting with you this Friday.  I 
hope we can reschedule next week as I'll arrive in Houston Monday mid-day.

I'd love to talk to you as I know the knowledge base in your group related to 
my new responsibilities is huge.  Will you be able to free up some time of 
some of your team members to help us?

As an example, I'd like to show you our position book (cash).  It's far from 
being perfect.  I'd like to know whether we should persevere and improve it 
or whether there are some models in ENA that we could copycat....

I look forward to seeing you next week,

Remi

Dear Professor Kaminski

    I , Masayuki Fujita was the only Japanese attendee of the Energy 
Derivatives seminar
in Houston last December and a member of Japanese consultation firm: 
Mitsubishi Research
Institute, Inc. I would be very honored if you can meet with me 17 or 18 
April after
attending Energy Trading Summit in 12th-14th. As you know, Japanese 
electricity trading is
on the way of deregulation beneficial to the consumers from a long stage of 
the nine major
companies' regional monopoly. We are giving a hand to help the Ministry and 
industry to
find the right course of them. I and my colleague Yamada, who will attend Risk
Publications Monte Calro seminar in Four Seasons Hotel, would like to visit 
you and your
company for studying the sophisticated risk management at Enron. In return, 
we may give
you the information about recent institutional progress and major electricity 
companies
response in Japan.

    We are now personally translating your book "Managing Energy Price Risk" 
second
edition and wondering if you have not given the right to publish in Japanese 
and nay give
us the chance to help you introduce modern technology to manage energy risk 
in the
Japanese energy industry.

    I do not hope Japanese English power prevent me to pass my sincerity to 
you and I can
visit you soon.

  India: Enron aftermath

   Business Line - 02/21/2000

   A Study of the Enron Project 

   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195

   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has 
been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the
   inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only 
in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even
   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996, 
which while commenting that "This case has
   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, 
political considerations outweigh the public interest and
   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to 
justify its actions not only before the public but even before
   the courts of law" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the 
project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even
   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws 
of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.

   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and 
recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required
   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.

   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological 
narration - of all events, including the process of bending all
   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving 
unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of
   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.

   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by 
all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the
   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only 
facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'
   documents.

   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including 
extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet
   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were 
opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to
   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 
'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the
   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the
   events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the 
crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen
   annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of 
factual information. The strange saga of the Enron
   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single 
project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted
   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to 
face the problem.

   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of 
electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the
   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited 
liability company registered in India, through a maze of
   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' 
companies registered in various tax-free havens.

   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount 
to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.
   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) 
crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than
   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' 
figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the
   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was 
to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents
   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.

   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to 
international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone
   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel 
prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.
   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even 
though international prices have more than doubled - we
   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a 
total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity
   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase 
I of the project.

   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 
24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at
   11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; 
for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.

   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or 
capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US
   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as 
compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay
   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign 
exchange as payment to just one project authority, for
   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.

   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this 
payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase
   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international 
prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of
   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; 
the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government
   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are 
mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees
   extended by both governments.

   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by 
all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the
   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric 
Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power
   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that 
already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200
   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) 
and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal
   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced 
to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.

   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.

   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.

   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was 
contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of
   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent 
experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,
   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World 
Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The
   detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure 
tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even
   statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully 
documented by Abhay Mehta.

   Mehta correctly concludes: "We frequently blame external agencies - like 
the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a
   matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant 
case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of
   India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of 
the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note
   here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a 
somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and
   the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW 
residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that
   Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US 
cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the
   estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in 
December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5
   per unit).

   One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's 
crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron
   saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the 
story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.

   For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on 
'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no
   exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation 
of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current
   'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of 
rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.

   The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the 
Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and
   Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of 
the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron
   saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government 
were overruled.

   And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of 
power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission
   and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the 
new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to
   be spelt out.

   Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad 
and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break
   up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can 
be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on
   the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the 
UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision
   to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan 
Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a
   loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities 
after the trifurcation - need to be noted.

   That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that 
tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP
   government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash 
even for routine maintenance as a result of the above
   - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the 
remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and
   restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise 
the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity
   with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against 
this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely
   disseminated, read, and its implications understood.

   What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake 
is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this
   country.

   What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private 
aggrandisement.

Subject: Hedging LNG Volumes


	

Hi Marc,

DPC would like a swap to hedge its price expsoure on LNG. We do understand 
that there exists a basis risk between JCC (the LNG SPA index) and Brent (the 
market index for the product) and will bear such risk. We also appreciate the 
fact that this is a financial product and irrespective of actual consumption, 
we will still have to bear the burden (if any) of the swap. 

Fuel - LNG indexed to JCC (closely correlated to Brent Futures)

   Period     Volumes (TBtu)  Volumes(MT)  Volumes(JCC Bbls)
  January 2002 to December 2002    33.61          650,000     9,127,049  
  January 2003 to December 2003    48.63          940,000   13,207,496
  January 2004 to December 2004    48.63          940,000   13,207,496

Crude Swap Price: Can we look at a 'dirty' hedge and get a crude($/Bbl) swap 
price. Like any other regular swap, this will be a monthly settle product.

The above conversions from MT to Bbls are based on LNG conversion factors. 
(14.04 Bbls/MT). 

We also would like to understand the requirements of the Credit Group to put 
this hedge in place. Please indicate the process as well as the security 
mechanisms to provide adequate credit support for the swap. 

Please call me(98210 38711) or Rajesh (98201 88310) for any additional info.

Regards,
Anshuman

Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you 
about on the phone.  

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction 
by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the 
transaction to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just 
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would 
like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion 
please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to 
market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from 
the Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may 
need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account 
for these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there 
will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon 
consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that 
we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through 
Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the 
US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in 
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income 
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get 
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the 
US.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of 
the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F 
and other concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and 
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to 
Indian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type 
of accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, 
and will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting 
project for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

resultant offer to Cairn. Currently, I have better things to do with my time.

I talked to Vince after we hung up and his only suggestion was to call 
Sandeep Kohli.  I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over 
a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after 
discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears 
to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed 
ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous 
variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better 
deal, please advise.

I strongly disagree with the pricing and structure of your non-binding offer 
to Cairn. This reminds me of the debacle in Brazil. You should have contacted 
Vince Kaminski's research group as we talked about before an offer was made. 
This is a bad deal.

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

Rebecca,

As we had spoken on the phone, I met with Mr. KK Sud, a retired Secretary in 
the govt. of India yesterday.  This meeting was arranged at Vince's request, 
since Vince had been approached by Mr. Sud's son who is a student at Rice 
(where Vince teaches a course).  The younger Mr. Sud had wanted someone at 
Enron to meet with his father who was visiting Houston, and is currently an 
advisor (post retirement from the government) to the Prime Minister's office.

This was my first meeting, and I have no background check on the person.  
However, the meeting was interesting, and Mr. Sud conveyed to me in 
confidence that the Indian govt. is very interested in solving the Dabhol 
issue.  He also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of 
NTPC buying all the power from Dabhol, but that this was still under wraps.

I have no way of judging the genuineness of this person, but he claimed to 
have been Secretary in the Ministry of Defence for some 16 years, which is a 
very important post in India.  The information he was conveying seemed so 
important that Vince and I decided to update you on the same by phone this 
morning.

Mr. Sud is leaving Houston on Monday so, as discussed, I will see if he can 
meet with you on Saturday morning.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: LNG Hedging

Jim,

I am attaching below a small draft note prepared by Anshuman on LNG hedging.

It talks of two products: 
(1) Volumetric Options (where we buy a call on 100% of the volumes and sell a 
put on 50% of the volumes to finance the call), and
(2)  Ratio Derivative where we buy two calls at a higher price, and sell one 
at a lower price to finance it.  This is not one that the traders agree to, 
since at the upper price, the calls bought are just at the money, while the 
sold call is in the money, and will cost the seller.

Hence, only Option 1 is useful.  It could provide risk mitigation in the high 
price scenario, while allowing some participation in low prices.  To test it, 
we used March 2001 period.  To have it cost neutral, we would buy a call at 
$26, and sell the put at $25.15.  

As we bounce these ideas, I think it is very important that we work closely 
with the Global Markets group.  The team on the ground knows the contracts 
better, and maybe able to give you insights on what can be sold to MSEB.

Would love to discuss the same with you.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Dear Professor Kaminski

    I , Masayuki Fujita was the only Japanese attendee of the Energy 
Derivatives seminar
in Houston last December and a member of Japanese consultation firm: 
Mitsubishi Research
Institute, Inc. I would be very honored if you can meet with me 17 or 18 
April after
attending Energy Trading Summit in 12th-14th. As you know, Japanese 
electricity trading is
on the way of deregulation beneficial to the consumers from a long stage of 
the nine major
companies' regional monopoly. We are giving a hand to help the Ministry and 
industry to
find the right course of them. I and my colleague Yamada, who will attend Risk
Publications Monte Calro seminar in Four Seasons Hotel, would like to visit 
you and your
company for studying the sophisticated risk management at Enron. In return, 
we may give
you the information about recent institutional progress and major electricity 
companies
response in Japan.

    We are now personally translating your book "Managing Energy Price Risk" 
second
edition and wondering if you have not given the right to publish in Japanese 
and nay give
us the chance to help you introduce modern technology to manage energy risk 
in the
Japanese energy industry.

    I do not hope Japanese English power prevent me to pass my sincerity to 
you and I can
visit you soon.

In Colombia we are setting up a trading operation and would be nice to have a 
copy of the new book for our reference. Please let us know how we can get 
access to a copy.

Many thanks,

Stinson/Vince,

The Henwood runs for Dabhol are, at least temporarily, over.  However, the 
main modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their California 
office.

It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, and 
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.

In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people have 
raised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the way 
Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues of 
cycling plants.

I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the 
PSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.  
This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.

Regards,
Sandeep.

 I have recently come on board as Treasurer ,Enron India . Prior to joining , 
I was with Reliance Industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in India.
   The  Central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting 
corporates  to hedge their oil and other related risks. I believe the 
literature published
 by Risk in collaboration with Enron has come to be considered as an  
industry standard. Would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent 
across to us .
 
Thanx N Regards

Vince,

My apologies for writing to you after such a long gap. I wanted to thank you 
for the book you sent, as well as al the help that is been rendered by 
Krishna towards our efforts here

Our efforts here are becoming more intense and I will continue to need your 
group help as we proceed along the way.
Separately I have not yet forgotten about the training we had spoken about. 
However, give the intensity of our current effort we may need to hold on to 
that for some months. In the meantime we will continue to work together.

Once again I would like to thank you and Krishna for all your help and 
support.

Thanks and best regards
Sandeep

Reliance allowed to hawk power from Patalganga to third parties=20
Arijit De, S Ravindran & Renni Abraham in Mumbai

 In an unusual departure from normal practice, the Maharashtra government h=
as=20
allowed the Reliance  group to sell power generated by its 447-mw  Patalgan=
ga=20
power project directly to third parties if   the Maharashtra State=20
Electricity Board (MSEB)  does not lift power. The project=01,s power purch=
ase=20
agreement (PPA) has a clause to this effect.  The state government=01,s=20
permission to Reliance to  hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th=
e=20
context of its dithering on forwarding to the Centre  the Dabhol Power=20
Company=01,s bid for mega power  status so that it could sell power to thir=
d=20
parties.=20

 DPC sources told Business Standard several weeks ago that the company=01,s=
=20
application had been pending with the Chief Minister=01,s office for months=
.=20
Only now has the state government authorised the Godbole committee to=20
negotiate with DPC on third  party sales outside the state. The DPC project=
=20
is facing the threat of closure  following MSEB=01,s inability to buy power=
 from=20
it,  thanks to the Board=01,s weak financial position.  Not only can the=20
Reliance group sell power to third parties within Maharashtra, but it can=
=20
sell power to utilities outside the state. The PPA does not  expressly bar =
it=20
from doing so. Nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power=
=20
can be sold. So, in effect, this suggests that the group could sell power t=
o =20
industrial and commercial customers in  Maharashtra and emerge as a rival t=
o=20
the MSEB.The state electricity board derives over 80 per cent  of its reven=
ue=20
from such consumers.=20

 Apart from captive power plants, independent power producers in India are=
=20
allowed to sell power only to  state electricity boards. They can sell powe=
r =20
outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status.  With=
=20
its 447-mw capacity, the Patalganga project is not eligible for such status=
=20
because mega power  rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity  of 1,0=

No need of Patalganga, Bhadravati power: MSEB=20

THE AXE seems to have finally fallen on the much-delayed Reliance=20
Industries-promoted Patalganga and Ispat Industries' Bhadravati Power=20
projects in Maharashtra as  the state electricity board has firmly told the=
=20
government  that "there is no need of these projects nor their power". The=
=20
loss-making board has communicated to the government that MSEB had "no=20
interest" in Patalganga and Bhadravati, as it did not have escrow-able=20
capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  =20
tremendously in Maharashtra, state government sources  said here on Sunday.=
=20
"In last November itself, MSEB had sent an official intimation to the state=
=20
government informing its decision in  favour of cancellation of the two=20
projects on several grounds -- including they being unviable and=20
unaffordable," sources said. "Reliance's project is no different from that =
of=20
DPC's. Patalganga is also naphtha-based and its PPA is on similar lines...=
=20

After the Enron experience, MSEB cannot  even dream of another gas-based=20
power plant in the state," a senior MSEB official said. He said MSEB has=20
already asked the state government  not to provide escrow to both the 447-m=
w=20
Patalganga and  the 1,084-mw coal-based Bhadravati, "as the US energy major=
=20
has almost squeezed us of all over finances". When contacted, MSEB chairman=
=20
Vinay Bansal said: "Reliance and Ispat projects have been put on hold as pe=
r =20
the Godbole Committee's recommendations", but  expressed inability to give=
=20
further details.=20

Currently, Bhadravati and Patalganga projects have been  put on hold as per=
=20
Godbole Committee report, which was set up to review the DPC-MSEB PPA and=
=20
energy scenario in Maharashtra. "Can you go ahead with the project without =
an=20
escrow cover?" the committee was believed to have asked Ispat  and Reliance=
=20
representatives, to which the reply had been  negative, sources added.=20
Sources said, as of now, both the projects have not been able to achieve=20
financial closure as leading financial   institutions were not willing to=
=20
fund the projects which do  not have a "guaranteed payment" mechanism from=
=20
MSEB, which, incidentally it has promised to DPC. "All the three were clear=
ed=20
as 'fast-track' projects, but other than Enron, Reliance and Ispat have bee=
n=20
caught in a quagmire, especially Bhadravati, which has been hanging afire=
=20
since last nine years," they added.=20

Moreover, the MSEB official opined that given the current situation, if DPC=
=20
calls it quits from India, Bhadravati was a safer bet than Reliance's=20
Patalganga. Patalganga's power would be mere 50 paise less than that of DPC=
's=20
that ranges anywhere around approximately Rs  4.50 per unit to as high as R=
s=20

informed. MSEB's installed capacity ended on March 31, 2001, was14,000 mw a=

GE may pull out as DPC supplier , S Ravindran in Mumbai

After US-based Bechtel, it is now the turn of General Electric to review it=

participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2,184-mw power=20
project in Maharashtra, being set up by the Dabhol Power Company.Bechtel is=

primarily turbines.General Electric, like Bechtel, also holds 10 per cent i=

Dabhol Power Company (DPC). And both Bechtel and General Electric are worri=

about future payments from DPC. Sources familiar with the project said that=

so far DPC has not defaulted in its payments to General Electric. What is=
=20
worrying General Electric is the possible scenario after June 7, when about=
=20
700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase  trial runs.

DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board  (MSEB) have been locked in=
 a=20
payments dispute for months. If MSEB continues with its stance, DPC in turn=
=20
may not be able to pay General Electric. In such a situation, GE may walk o=

General Electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by Business=

Standard. Senior executives at its public relations agency Burson  =20
Marsteller Roger Pereira said that only DPC executives were authorised to=
=20
speak on the issue. The DPC spokesman declined to comment on the issue.

The first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned. After the seco=

phase of 1,444 mwis commissioned by December, 2001, MSEB will  have to pay=

Consequently, it will not operationalise the escrow account. This casts a=

Godbole panel suggestions unacceptable: Enron, Girish Kuber=20

HOPES that the Godbole committee would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol=20
power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be=20
misplaced. The US energy major says that the Godbole committee=01,s suggest=
ions=20
were unacceptable. In response to a query from ET, the company said in a=20
statement that the  =01&published terms of the Godbole report do not repres=
ent=20
an acceptable basis for further discussions.=018  The statement said that i=
t=20
would be meeting the committee next week as =01&a matter of courtesy=018. =
=01&Since=20
the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei=
r=20
thoughts, we will not present any proposals,=018 the statement said. Accord=
ing=20
to highly-placed sources in the government, the company has informed the=20
Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May 11. Earlier reports ha=
d=20
indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May 5.=20

According to sources, Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives=
=20
of its lenders and shareholders. The Godbole committee, that studied the=20
current power purchase agreement, has called for cancellation of the presen=
t=20
tariff structure, renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract, removal o=
f=20
dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned, deb=
t=20
restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power=20
purchase agreement. These suggestions, it seems, may not be acceptable to=
=20
Enron. The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole=
=20
committee to renegotiate. The committee has been given a month=01,s time to=
=20
renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA.

The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of 5 mmpta is far in=
=20
excess of what is required by the plant (only 2.1 mmpta of which 1.8 mmpta =
is=20
on take or pay), it should be separated into a distinct facility whose=20
capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge, not as take or pa=
y.=20
It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow=
er=20
generation. Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF.=
=20
Instead, the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro=
n=01,
s own Metgas. =01&It is important to distribute the cost over the entire=20
capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant,=018 says the=20
committee. Similarly, it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the=
=20
harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers. On the LNG=
=20
contract negotiated by Enron for long-term supplies, it has said that since=
=20
the LNG market has witnessed great changes, particularly as far as prices a=
re=20
concerned, the power company should take advantage of spot buys and=20
renegotiate the contract accordingly.

Enron ready to take part in PPA talk ,  Nitin Yeshwantrao

The Enron management has finally agreed to  participate in a 'discussion'=
=20
with the Madhav Godbole-led re-negotiation committee set-up to facilitate=
=20
the  restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the=
=20
US power major and the state government.Officials of Dabhol Power Company=
=20
(DPC), a subsidiary of Enron, alongwith their team of shareholders and =20
lenders will arrive here on May 11 for talks with the  nine-member Godbole=
=20
panel.Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation, a k=
ey=20
Mantralaya official told The times of  India that the team had expressed=20
willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the=20
imbroglio.

Enron's response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the=
=20
controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks, with the board of=
=20
directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a=20
termination notice to MSEB. The state government, on its part, too adopted =
a=20
confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 crore rebate charge on DPC fo=
r=20
defaulting on power supply.However, the sudden change of heart by the Enron=
=20
management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le=
d=20
by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) which had recently opposed t=
he=20
move to pull out of the project. This was in contradiction to the stand tak=
en=20
by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes=
=20
on disbursement of funds to DPC. The Congress-led Democratic Front governme=
nt=20
had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to=20
renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o=
f=20
both the parties.

Last week, the state government constituted a nine-member panel of experts=
=20
under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole. Godbole had written to the DPC=20
management inviting it for talks to re-negotiate the PPA on May 5. For the=
=20
delayed response from Enron, the meeting has been rescheduled to May 11.The=
=20
issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the=
=20
LNG facility from the power plant, renegotiating LNG supply and shipping=20
agreements, redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a two-part=20
tariff. The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar=20
denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra=20

Jim,

Please find attached some slides that show the results of the Henwood run 
giving dispatch for the Dabhol plant within Maharashtra.  I have also sent 
the presentation we made to you to Wade.  He is to get back on when would be 
an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me.

Vince, Stinson and I have placed ourselves on Rebecca's calender for Friday, 
and we will make the complete pitch to her.  It would be great if you too 
could be present at the meeting.  If it is possible, please do let me know.

On the attached slides, please note that:
The slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff, MSEB liability for 
the entire capacity payment is not considered.
The Henwood model was with no power flowing out of Maharashtra
When variable O&M costs, fixed O&M cost plus fuel costs increased beyond 5 
cents/kWh (equal to MSEB's average realization), load went unmet
In 2002 the slide shows the monthly dispatch from Dabhol in equivalent MW 
terms, and also the load shedding in Maharashtra 
We cross-checked the Henwood run load shedding data against actual hourly 
load shedding data from 1999-2000 that we had from MSEB
My estimate is that for December and January the load shedding maybe more 
than what the Henwood model shows, but overall the run passes the laugh test
The graph also shows the monthly bill (based on 7.21 cents/kWh) that MSEB 
would have to pay for the DPC dispatch.
The next slide shows our estimate of MSEB's payment capability (range from 
$38-46 MM/month)
The Henwood run shows an average bill for 2002 to be $41 MM/month; though in 
some months (Jan) it goes as high as $69 MM.  Hence, overall, MSEB can pay 
for the dispatches as shown in the Henwood run provided, they are not paying 
for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 MW plant.
In conclusion, therefore, MSEB has the need for between 1200 to 410 MW on a 
seasonal basis.  This means that the power remaining to be sold to other 
states is the difference between that and 2184 MW.
However, since the demand within Maharashtra varies seasonally, it may mean 
that we need to market seasonal products to other states, not long term 
blocks.

These are our conclusions.  We may continue to work some more on the fuel and 
hedging side.  If you have any more questions for me, please let me know, 
else for now there will not be any new Henwood runs.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Vince/Stinson,

Please find below a summary of the presenation given to Lenders at the April 
23rd meeting in London.

The key points that emerge are:
Phase II will require commitments of about $700 MM to complete (Phase I+II 
Total $3.2 Billion)
Several commercial issues are getting severe in the current environment in 
India, could result in cost escalations
Makes the case that MSEB does not have the financial strength to absorb Phase 
II power
Management to seek authority to serve Preliminary Termination Notice (PTN), 
triggering a 6 month cure period

A copy of the full presenation is available.  

Regards,
Sandeep.

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice 
to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.

I have been at Enron for eight months and work under Sally Beck.

In December I attended the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference, where I met 
Masayuki Fujita from the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  He is doing research 
on the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and 
chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8 
1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).

He was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with 
Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally 
suggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you 
were out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want 
to meet him back in Tokyo anyway.

Would you like for me to set something up?

Regards,



Eugenio
