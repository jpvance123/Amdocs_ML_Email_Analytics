Tom,
Lynn is in California until next Wednesday October 24th so I need to arrange the flights for this trip. So far it looks like either day is good for the meeting on Nominations and Scheduling so I will arrange for Lynn and I to come to Omaha on the 29th. We will arrive around 12:30pm and our flight will leave Omaha around 6:30pm.  
Please let me know if there is any problems with this timeline.

Thanks: John Buchanan

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.

Looks like our work of hounding Oneok finally paid off.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

Natural Gas Futures Dip as Cash Tumbles



    Natural gas futures for December delivery on the NYMEX dipped
only $0.039 to $2.813 last Wednesday with traders concerned about a
near-term rallying trend and possible colder weather soon. The
January contract settled at 2.991 per MMBtu, down $0.05. January fell
5.0 cents to settle at $2.991/MMBtu. Last Wednesday, the AGA reported
a higher than expected 15 Bcf storage injection, even so defensive
short covering was seen after the report, primarily from locals and
trades. There is now 3.132 Tcf in storage, more than the previous
high of 3.127 Tcf in  November 1998. In December of that year,
physical prices fell below $1 per MMBtu. The AGA revised the previous
week's injection from of 7 Bcf to 17 Bcf, accounting for the
additional 10 Bcf on the total. Physical prices plunged as marketers
discounted the long, low-demand holiday weekend. Expect more selling
today if sustained cold forecasts do not appear. The long holiday had
almost no industrial demand, so unless the cold is sustained, there
is little hope for higher prices. The huge gap between November cash
prices and December futures prices is a good indication that the
futures market is ripe for a huge sell-off as early as today, as it
follows cashs lead down. Natural gas for next day delivery across the
US and Canada tumbled $0.15  $0.30 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $1.93 per MMBtu.

California DWR Power Contracts May Lose Billions

    A California Department of Water Resources analysis says that
power it purchased at an average of $75 per MWh may have to be
unloaded for as little as $16 per MWh, possibly costing consumers as
much as $3.9 billion for unused power over the next 9 years. The
analysis compares DWR commitments under current power contracts to
estimates of power demand and market costs through 2010. According to
the analysis, the DWR, which buys power for the state's 3 investor-
owned utilities, may have to sell as much as 33% of the power bought
in some years at about an 80% loss. The DWR has signed about $43
billion in multiyear electricity contracts so far this year.

Enron's Japan Subsidiary Under Review

    The Japanese subsidiary of Enron is reviewing its business and
hopes to conclude its findings in the next couple of weeks. Enron
Japan is a wholly owned subsidiary. It began its own assessment about
a week ago. Enron Japan's business includes E Power Corp, a venture
set up in Japan by Enron and Orix Corp, a leasing company, which is
studying possible electric power plants. Shares of Enron plummeted
another 28% Wednesday even though it reached a critical agreement to 
extend a $690 million debt payment. Some continue to question whether
Dynegy's planned $8.9 billion acquisition will survive. The latest
problems started last week after Enron filed a document with the SEC
saying it would have to repay $690 million in debt by November 26th
because of decreased credit ratings. Enron Japan was established in
April 2000 and employs 60. It had hoped to eventually break into
Japan's power industry which is slowly growing more open.

Economic Experts to Report on Recession Today

    A panel from the National Bureau of Economic Research held a
teleconference last week to discuss whether or not the US has entered
its first recession in over 10 years and will announce the decision
on its website today. The group technically defines a recession as a
significant decline in activity spread across the economy lasting
more than a few months, visible in industrial production, employment,
real income and wholesale-retail trade. The elimination of 415,000
jobs in October, the highest in 5 years at 5.4% versus a 30-year low
of 3.9% a year ago, could lead the committee to announce a recession.
Industrial output peaked in September of last year, while
manufacturing and sales reached their top almost a year ago.
Industrial production fell at a faster rate in October than in almost
11 years, continuing a 13-month drop, according to the Federal
Reserve. Factory, wholesale and retail sales, adjusted for inflation,
topped out in August 2000 and fell for 8 out of the next 10 months.
In a signal that the slump may have bottomed-out, sales have risen
for the past 4 months. Additionally, incomes adjusted for inflation
have climbed in 9 out of the past 10 months contrary to the last
recession in which they fell for 6 out of 8 months. The implied yield
on the February federal funds futures, key indicators of the Feds
actions at its next 2 meetings is 1.91%, just 0.09% below the current
overnight rate and seems to indicate that investors do not think that
further rate reductions are in the offing. In addition, major stock
indexes have been higher for 7 of the past 9 weeks, with the Dow
Jones rising about 4% since September 11th. The Nasdaq has climbed
12% from September 10th levels and 10-year Treasury notes have risen
to 5% from a 3-year low of 4.18% on November 7th. The Blue Chip
Economic Indicator predicts that the economy will shrink by 1.9% in
the 4th-quarter and others forecast that a mild recession will
continue until the first quarter of 2002. The panel typically
requires at least 6 months of data beyond a peak in the economy
before it will consider pronouncing a recession.

California ISO Produces Plan to Meet FERC Order

    In a plan filed with the FERC last week, California's ISO has
come up with a schedule for the states Department of Water Resources
to pay off about $956 million in late payments to generators by
February 2002. The ISO oversees a daily power auction and acts as the
billing agent for sales. The operators have contended that the DWRs
status as credit guarantor for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern
California Edison relieved it of responsibility for making direct
payments. However earlier this month, the FERC declared the DWR as
scheduling coordinator, a typical designation for utilities, making
the water department liable for purchases it made on behalf of the
utilities, and gave the operators 15 days to submit a payment plan
for the period of January 17, 2001 to July 31, 2001. The utilities
still owe generators about $3.6 billion for power purchased over that
time and the DWR is owed about $2.7 billion for power supplied over
the same period, resulting in arrears of about $956 million. The
water department says it has reserved about $1.2 billion in
preparation for such a payment. The ISO says that the FERC-ordered
dual-billing system would be too complex and costly and asked that
the commission allow it to use the current system, under which all
payments would be disbursed by February 7th, 2 weeks ahead of the
FERCs schedule.

Enron Shares Fall on Takeover Concern

    Enron shares and bonds fell for a 3rd day on concern its weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy to try to cancel or rework the
takeover. Shares dropped $0.30, or 6%, to $4.71. They fell 45%
Tuesday and Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than
$9 billion in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4% bonds due in July 2006
were bid at $0.55 on the dollar, down from $0.62 on Wednesday.
Although there are continuing doubts about the deal, others say the
deal is solid and will be completed as soon as details are worked
out. Last Wednesday, Enron got a 3-week reprieve from lenders on a
$690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Also Dynegy's CEO says he was encouraged by
the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of
a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remains committed to
the purchase. Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in a
bid to help its finances with an injection of as much as $2 billion.
Under the November 9th terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy shares for each share held, currently making each share worth
$10.85.

New Investment Likely in Enron

Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group
are among the possible private equity investors in Enron to help the
company's balance sheet. Those firms have cash on hand and have
invested in energy companies in the past. Many of the larger, more
traditional buyout firms would find this deal attractive, analysts
say. Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment. Investors may inject as
much as $2 billion under arrangements that would protect them from
further declines in the stock price. The new investments would be in
Enron's Transwestern Pipeline. JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup have
also agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity
stake as part of a transaction to be completed today. KKR is the 2nd
biggest private equity firm with $24 billion in assets.

Will need to document a revision to the Plainview allocation.  An enhancement request with requirements, detailed as much as possible, for IT to begin understanding what the impact and estimate would be for the change.

I think there are some misunderstanding on what activity is included in a Plainview allocation. What needs to be done, as a 1st step, to initiate revisions to the Plainview allocation?

1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.

Crude Oil Futures Rise Ahead of Extended Holiday Weekend

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.34
to $19.62 per barrel on Friday as the market traded on short-term
technicals. Traders were squaring their books before the long
Christmas hokiday. Expectations that OPEC would finally move ahead
with a plan to remove 2 million bpd from the world market likely gave
the pre-holiday market a boost. The cartel has agreed to chop 1.5
million bpd from production if non-OPEC producers remove an
additional 500,000 bpd between them. Last week, Omans raised its
pledge to trim output from 25,000 to 40,000 bpd, which leaves the
cartel only 37,500 bpd short of its goal. OPEC ministers plan to meet
in Cairo on December 28th to weigh their options, but insiders say
the cartel will move ahead with their plans, despite the relatively
small shortfall. Petroleum inventories are 50 million barrels higher
than a year ago, after a slumping economy whittled away at demand.
But gasoline and heating oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell for the
week ended December 14th and crude inventories rose less than
predicted. The EIA said that the national average retail price for
gasoline has fallen $0.036 to $1.06 per gallon, down $0.36 from a
year ago. Gasoline futures for January delivery on the NYMEX climbed
$0.0083 to $0.5586 per gallon. January heating oil futures on the
NYMEX rose $0.0035 to $0.5484 per gallon after forecasts that
temperatures in the Northeast would be near or below normal over the
Christmas season. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February
delivery on the IPE were up $0.23 to $19.36 per barrel.

Bad Weather in Russia Lowers Oil Exports


    Russia is set to announce crude exports in the 4th quarter were
almost 150,000 bpd below what was planned due to bad weather. The
fall, equal to what OPEC asked Russia to cut in exports in the 1st
quarter of 2002, would be down from an initial 4th quarter schedule
of 2.88 million bpd for Russian and transit oil. The 4th quarter
figures will be released in early January. Predictions are that
Russia will be short by 145,000  160,000 bpd if the weather does not
take a turn for the worse. Third quarter exports came in around 3
million bpd. Russia committed to trim exports by 150,000 bpd as part
of OPEC's plan to have non-members contribute 500,000 bpd in export
reductions before the cartel would lower its production by 1.5
million bpd. Removal of the oil from the global market is aimed at
lifting prices which have tumbled as an economic downturn has eaten
away at demand. But, Russian oil exports were already hard hit by
inclement weather in November when the key ports of Novorossiisk and
Tuapse in Russia, Odessa in Ukraine and Ventspils in Latvia were
closed for a total of 25 days. In December, Novorossiisk was shut-
down for over 10 days, while Lithuanian terminal Butinge was closed
the entire month because of an oil leak. Russian crude output and
export schedules are established every quarter and spread among the
country's oil firms. OPEC has asked Russia to explain the statistics
of its promised 1st quarter cut before the cartel meets on December
28 in Cairo to set its own final reduction. Those close to the
situation have reported that Russia will set exports at 2.6 million
bpd, or about 144,000 bpd lower than the 4th quarter. Lukoil said
that Russia needed to reduce output to prevent an already overloaded
pipeline system from breaking down.

Saudi Arabia and Oil Majors Negotiating Natural Gas Agreements

    Saudi Arabia and 8 international oil companies, which are
negotiating large natural gas investments in the country, have said
that they expect to sign executive agreements by next March. The
agreements center around 3 multi-billion dollar projects in the Saudi
natural gas sector. ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell will take the
lead in the kingdom's natural gas initiative. ExxonMobil has the lead
role in the $15 billion South Ghawar development, core venture one,
which includes Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and Phillips. ExxonMovil will
also lead the $5 billion Red Sea development, core venture 2, which
includes Occidental and Marathon. Royal Dutch/Shell has the leading
role in the $5 billion Shaybah development, core venture three, with
Conoco and TotalFinaElf. The natural gas initiative is expected to
boost the Saudi economy and create jobs. The kingdom's natural gas
upstream has been off-limits to foreign companies for the past 25
years.

EIA 2002 Energy Outlook

    Average world oil prices will gradually move higher from 2002
through the year 2020 as demand rises by 56%, according to the EIA in
its Annual Energy Outlook 2002 report, but natural gas and
electricity prices will likely fall. The EIA expects world oil demand
to rise to 118.9 million bpd in 2020. World demand stood at 76
million bpd seen in 2000. World oil prices will also average $22.48 a
barrel in 2001, down from $27.72 in 2000, before starting a gradual
increase after 2002, the report predicted. The price in 2020 will
reach $24.68 per barrel, largely due to higher projected world
demand. The EIA also forecasted that OPEC oil production will reach
57.5 million bpd in 2020, almost twice the 30.9 million bpd produced
last year. Average wellhead prices for natural gas will likely be at
$4 per Mcf in 2001, up from $3.60 in 2000, but then decline sharply
by 2020, the EIA report said. It predicted a price of $3.26 per Mcf
for 2020, even though demand that year will likely be 1 Tcf lower
than was projected in 2001, because of a less optimistic assessment
of natural gas reserves discovered by exploratory drilling.
Electricity prices are also predicted to decline to $0.065 per kWh in
2020, down from $0.069 in 2000. But the new 2020 price level is
higher than the $0.061 projected last year because of higher than
previously expected electricity demand. The accuracy of 20-year
forecast is not only severely limited but also does not account for
the volatility during the period. To see the full report, please go

Shell and Gazprom in Russian Arctic Natural Gas Deal

    Russia's Gazprom is set to conclude a joint venture agreement
with Shell that will allow Shell to invest in a huge Arctic natural
gas field operated by Gazprom. The deal is supported by both Vladimir
Putin and Tony Blair. Gazprom brought the field onstream last October
in the polar region of Yamal-Nenets. The field, Zapolyarnoye, is the
world's 5th largest natural gas field. It holds 3 trillion cubic
meters and a life of at least 42 years.

Antitrust Lawsuit Reinstated Against Major Oil Companies

    An appeals court has strengthened the claims of a 1997 lawsuit
that alleges oil and petrochemical companies used shared salary
information to unlawfully keep workers' pay at artificially low
levels. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower court
ruling dismissing the lawsuit, brought against 14 major companies
that employ about 80% - 90% percent of the industry's work force. The
defendants previously denied the allegations. The case was sent back
to the lower court for further proceedings. The lawsuit was brought
by a former Exxon worker on behalf of herself and other Exxon
employees alleging the companies violated federal antitrust law by
regularly sharing detailed information about compensation paid to
nonunion managerial, professional and technical employees agreeing
that they would use the data to set salaries. In addition to Exxon,
the other defendants include: Mobil, Texaco and Chevron.

Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

	Lisa,

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

I have purchased external charges for your Blackberrys.  This will allow charging away from desktop or laptop, away from the cradle.
 
I would estimate you will have about 3-4 days away from your desktop/laptop (no charging) with normal usage. 
 
Thanks.  Jean

Getting setup for TMS Model Office and Production and PLE Production can now be done through ERequest.  You might want to look at it to know what your "customer" will see.  Login to ERequest and select the "Update Account Access" button.  Then select "Applications".  Be sure the Region is set to "ETS".  You can find the TMS and PLE options after you hit the "Show All" button.

Here is how the ERequest is setup to work:
1.  The user makes the request
2.  An email is sent to their manager for approval.  The manager then approves or denies the request.
3.  If the manager approves the request, an email is sent to the security approvers.  The security approvers are:
	for TMS - Maggie (primary), Ramona (secondary)
	for PLE - LInda (primary), Karen (secondary)
Once you click on the link in the email, you will be able to see what company and level of access this person is requesting.  You can also either approve or deny the request.  If you are adding comments (the solution center asks that you please do), be sure the hit the "Add Comments" button.
Please note:  once you click on the request link in the email it is assigned to you.  Please do not click on the link in the email unless you are going to follow through with the entire request.
4.  If the security approver approves the request, an email will be sent to the network team to give the user access.  The security approver above is expected to setup the access within the application.
5.  Once the request is finished, an email will be sent to the user.  If approved, the user will see the application on their start menu the next time he/she reboots.

There may be a few kinks in this process at first, but rest assured it is very easy to make changes.

This new process will be mentioned in tomorrow's ETS Solution Center Change Control items email.  Feel free to contact Lupita Cantu, Glenda Wagner, or Patti Dennis with questions.

John,  I've rewritten the beginning of this notice to be more consistent with the posting we did for the Bushton shut down and receipt of C6+ gas in Jan etc.  

	"Northern has been notified by ElPaso that the nitrogen level being delivered at the Keystone Interconnect (POI 169) exceeded their tariff specification on October 11, 2001 and as a result gas was not confirmed for delivery to them at that point.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in the area, and gas received by Northern with a high nitrogen content in this area may not be confirmed for receipt or curtailed, if previously scheduled, in accordance with gas quality specifications in section 44 of Northern's tariff.  If this becomes necessary, the points listed below will be allocated or curtailed in the following order based on the gas stream compostion.    List"   

Insert your list, but We don't understand how this relates to Spraberry Area and Hobbs Area, what are the points???
Please call if you have any questions.  


P.S.  I agree with Mary Kay's comments (of course).  Dari

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	"The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows."

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Lynn,
Remedy has been updated to give home office workers a high priority and to be assigned to Glenn or Robert when possible.

Glenn did install a modem in Shirley's machine.

There is still some issue with the CITRIX Server and VPN access, the solution center believes the problem is on the Road Runner side and Jean McFarland is working on it. Everyone is working from home with little to no problems despite the CITRIX issue.

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Here are the preliminary reports ready for your review.  I have done a thorough analysis on Items 2 and 3 and feel very confident with the data.  I will be finalizing my review of contract volume data in Item 1 no later than tomorrow and will advise if any changes are necessary.

TK - Please update the daily rates for contract 27495 (Astra) and verify the rates in blue.  Additionally, please verify that the discounted IT rates for contract 20248 and 22136 are correct as billed (it doesn't appear that these discounts appeared in the daily transactional report postings).

I need all updates/comments no later than COB Monday, 10/29/01.

 



Thanks,
Elizabeth

Eastern New Mexico has terminated its agency agreement with Enron North America.  From now on, Coral will be agent for their shipper contract, 24754.  Eastern New Mexico and Coral are still discussing what to do with Eastern New Mexico's OBA agreement, 25190, but that will be settled before the end of the month.  

If you need to get in contact with them for nomination and scheduling issues you can reach Susie Horton (Coral) at 713-767-5406.  And for operational questions at their point (13199) or regarding their OBA imbalance, you can reach Ricky Britain (Eastern New Mexico) at 505-355-2468.

Thanks,
Amy

While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

I didn't know where to ask, so here goes.  Please advise me of  whom I need to contact.   I recently was going thru My dad and mother's belongings,  I  found a life insurance policy for my dad.  It was issued by  Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, thru Northern Natural Gas  Company to Lawrence Maitland Rowden in October of 1952.     I am trying to find out if it is still in affect,  as my dad  passed away in 1999.  Any help or guidance would be greatly  appreciated.   Michael Rowden ( surviving son) 7000 Millennium Dr. Fort Smith, AR  72916 (501-788-8907)  Work #

December Crude Oil Futures Fall on Expiration


    Crude oil futures for December delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.31
to $17.72 per barrel as the contract expired yesterday. January crude
oil futures on the NYMEX gained $0.06 to $18.43 per barrel. December
crude futures sank to $16.70 per barrel soon after the opening bell,
but recovered some of losses before the sessions end. The market
appears to be monitoring the fray between Russia and OPEC over
production cuts. OPEC has delayed a planned 1.5 million bpd cut until
Russia agrees to significant output curbs. So far, Mexico has agreed
to a 100,000 bpd cut and Norway said it would discuss production
limits this week. Russia's privately held oil companies, however do
not seem inclined to make any major changes in production and say
that they can live with lower oil prices and still make a profit,
further increasing speculation of a price war. December gasoline
futures on the NYMEX gained 0.0057 to 0.5079 per gallon. Heating oil
futures for December delivery on the NYMEX rose $0.002 to $0.5328 per
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery on
the IPE were up $0.26 to $18.01 per barrel.

ChevronTexaco to Cut Additional Jobs

    ChevronTexaco now says it will cut 4500 jobs, 500 additional cuts
from its previous estimate. ChevronTexaco expects to achieve $1.8
million in yearly savings by 2003 by eliminating jobs that became
redundant when the two companies merged earlier this year. The
company also affirmed its $1.2 billion synergy savings within 6 - 9
months of the merger's completion. The cost cuts will be made across
the board, with the largest percentage expected in the refining and
marketing sector. ChevronTexaco projects that its return on capital
employed will increase from 2% to 3% within the next 2 years. It also
expects its oil and natural gas production to grow 2.5% - 3% annually
over the next 5 years, although output will rise only 1% next year
because of matters related to OPEC. The company says that its
investment in Dynegy, which recently has agreed to buy Enron, offers
a combination of significant upside potential and terms that will
protect its investment.

Mergers Spark Lack of Competition Concerns


    The latest merger in the oil industry, the $35 billion Phillips
and Conoco deal, has sparked worries that the lack of competition
could lead to volatile prices. As smaller companies leave the market,
the handful that remain will be dealing in progressively larger
volumes, which could result in increased price volatility. So far,
the FTC has presented very little in the way of a roadblock to the
mergers and takeovers. However, critics fear that if the fast-paced
trend in combining companies continues, the nation could perhaps end
up with only 3 super-giant oil companies, promoting a lack of
competition and causing consumers to pay much higher prices. But if
crude oil and natural gas prices collapse, only the biggest companies
will survive. The big mergers not only cut corporate costs, but also
increases a company's ability to deal in the Middle East. Some
analysts see the merger mania as an ongoing cyclical process and say
that at some point in the future there could be a rash of spin-offs
in the industry. Conoco-Phillips will become the 6th largest oil
company in the world and the 3rd largest in the US, behind Exxon
Mobil and ChevronTexaco. The Conoco-Phillips merger is seen by many
as a partnership of equals, made to survive in an industry of giants,
as the combined company will only be a quarter of the size of Exxon
Mobil.

Shareholders Approve Phillips Conoco Merger


    The merger between Phillips and Conoco has received approval from
shareholders. The deal will make the new company, called
ConocoPhillips, the world's 6th largest publicly held oil company
with a market value of $35 billion, although it will still be only a
quarter of ExxonMobil's size. In what seems to many to be a
partnership of equals, Phillips has agreed to pay $15.2 billion in a
stock exchange at the rate of 0.4677 per share of Phillips for each
share of Conoco and assume $9 billion in debt. Shares of Phillips
gained $1.53, almost 3%, to $53.35 and Conoco's shares climbed $1.68,
almost 7%, to $25.98 per share yesterday. Some of Conoco's investors
were disappointed by the sale price because no premium on their stock
was included. However, they were pleased to hear projections of $750 
million yearly in cost savings and 4% annual growth in oil and
natural gas production as a result of deal.

Heating Oil Prices May Decline More

    Even though heating oil futures rose $0.0109 last Friday to
finish at $0.05218 per gallon on the NYMEX, prices are still hovering
near their lowest point since August 1999. Existing stocks and an
impending OPEC price war are contributing to the decline in price for
heating oil and diesel. The nation's heating oil supply is now at
129.8 million barrels, a two-year high and 31% higher than a year
ago.

Russia Continues to Resist OPEC

    Russia continues to resist OPEC's pressure to help support
tumbling world oil prices, with both the government and companies
offering no new cuts in output or exports to support the market.
Russia's repeated rejection to reduce its supplies of crude oil again
sent prices falling yesterday. Russia reiterated its resistance to
others demands during talks with the energy minister of Mexico, which
has said it would make export reductions of its own. OPEC wants
Russia and other non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway to cut
production by 500,000 barrels in January. If they do, OPEC says it
will cut 1.5 million bpd. Russia says the world economy would grow
faster if prices stay at the $17-$19 per barrel range. It is also
technically more difficult for Russia to cut output than the Middle
East.

izzy over a beauty who captured his heart right on the set of his show.   S=

 five episodes of the ABC comedy this season.   "Charlie is crazy about Den=

 to meet Denise. Martin is thrilled his son is so happy.   "This is Charlie=

e, 36, and 30-year-old Denise - a former "James Bond" stunner - first met i=
n June 2000 when they worked together on the movie "Good Advice."   "Charli=
e liked her back then but she had a boyfriend so nothing happened," said th=
e insider. "Then Charlie recommended her for a guest spot on 'Spin City' th=
is season - and she was so good that one episode turned into five."   Once =
they were face-to-face again, Sheen was quickly smitten.   "Charlie says sh=
e is so beautiful that when he acted in scenes with her he had to stare at =
her forehead because her beauty destroyed his concentration!" revealed the =
insider.   "When they first started dating about two months ago they kept i=
t hidden from everyone on the set.    "They didn't want people they worked =
with talking about it.   "While they have gone out to restaurants and shops=
 together, they prefer to stay home. They watch movies and baseball and spe=

together to discuss tactics.   Now Hugh's vowed to back the beauty all the =
way in her battle to get Bing to face up to his responsibilities as a fathe=

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject:	Follow up on the Nomination/Confirmation Process

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.

When Lynn and Steve were both gone at the same time this week we realized that we needed to have another plan in place for getting wire and check requests signed by Rick who is located on 39.  So what we have decided to do if that happens again is to first, make sure that the teams know that Lynn and Steve will be gone and second, we will set up a basket in my office where you can drop your wire or check requests off and then either Josh or myself will get them down to Rick for his signature and then back to you.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

John, that sounds good.  The feedback I have received indicates the 29th is the better date.  Please let me know when your schedule is finalized and I will get out a note to the folks here.  How much time do you think you need?  Would 130-330 or so work?  Thanks again, Tom.

Tom,
Lynn is in California until next Wednesday October 24th so I need to arrange the flights for this trip. So far it looks like either day is good for the meeting on Nominations and Scheduling so I will arrange for Lynn and I to come to Omaha on the 29th. We will arrive around 12:30pm and our flight will leave Omaha around 6:30pm.  
Please let me know if there is any problems with this timeline.

Thanks: John Buchanan

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26"Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Joe and Sherry

No, I do not want the ENA contract hit with these flows.  We effectively shut them down on the 3rd.  Between then and 12/20, I want to look at other options.  I left Steve Kirk a message and he replied that he is out through Jan 2.  He suggested talking with Dari today regarding other options.  I'll let you know once I do.

	Vernon, the way the accounting system works today:  Dec. 1 - 20 flow will be attributed  to the
	contract that nominated at that point for the 21 through 31.  This automaticall happens if there
	is no OBA at the point and if there is only one contract nominated at the point.  If we do not want
	that to happen, we need to discuss our options. Thanks. Lynn

Yes, we were successful in getting a transporter to step in.  This starts tomorrow - however I am in talks with regulatory on what to do on the days between 12/3 - 12/20.  Also, we are not going to grant an OBA at this point at this time.

Vernon, Embassy is getting lined out for January business.  They just got caught in the middle of the ENA fallout, but they are anxious to get a resolution for December in place.  Thanks for your help.

The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or scheduled volume.

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Jean,

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Thanks, Mike

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean

Rick and Lynn,

Raetta and I heard from the mailroom early this afternoon that UPS was suspending service with Enron.  We discussed other options and decided to inquire with UPS or Fed Ex about opening an account thru NNG.

When I contacted UPS, I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron today.  The mailroom is aware of the situation.

Larry

Crude Oil Futures Regain Some of Last Weeks Losses

    Crude oil futures for December delivery on the NYMEX climbed
$0.58 to $18.03 per barrel on Friday. After OPEC decided last week to
the delay in its plan to trim 1.5 million bpd from its output, crude
prices plunged 19%, likely in an overreaction to a looming price war.
Traders may have realized that a price war will not happen until at
least January 1st, and that meanwhile OPEC and non-member producers
may reach an agreement. Only Mexico has indicated willingness to aid
OPEC by saying it would cut production by 100,000 bpd if others
outside of OPEC also make cuts. Norway says it will discuss possible
cuts later this week. The IEA says that demand tumbled by 2.5% in
September, the sharpest monthly drop in 2001. However, the drop in
oil prices could help stimulate the US economy by puttig more
spending money in consumers pockets. In addition, lower jet fuel
costs could help the airline industry to recover from its meltdown in
the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. December gasoline
futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0138 to $0.5022 per gallon. Heating oil
futures for December delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0109 to $0.5218
per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery
on the IPE were up $0.42 to $17.75 per barrel.

Russia Defends Stand on Crude Oil Production Cuts


Defending Russia's decision to not cooperate with OPEC on production
cuts to lift oil prices, its prime minister said that no one could
make demands of the country and that lower prices were not that much
of a concern for Moscow. OPEC recently decided to delay a much
anticipated 1.5 million bpd reduction in output until Russia agrees
to join other non-OPEC members in production cuts of 500,000 bpd.
Russia's prime minister contends that market fluctuations have
happened in the past and will continue to happen and a calm attitude
is needed. He said that a waiting period was needed in order to
properly judge what was happening on the market. He also added that
the country's policy was to balance its own interests and those of
producers and consumers. Russia needs to keep pumping oil in order to
meet repayments on $140 billion of foreign debt. Mexico's energy
secretary has visited Moscow to urge them to consider bigger
reductions in output. Mexico has said it would cut exports by 100,000
bpd if other non-OPEC producers would cut commensurately. Norway, the
worlds 3rd largest producer, has not offered to slice output so far,
but has said it will review its position next week. Venezuela's
energy minister also said he would visit Russia in December to lobby
for support. Russia's oil companies seem to have conflicting opinions
on the wisdom of making a big production cut. YUKOS, the country's
2nd largest oil company, has said it would fight output cuts and that
any reduction by Russia would simply lead other regional producers
such as Kazakhstan supplying volumes instead. Meanwhile, LUKOIL,
Russia's largest oil producer, said it could close some unprofitable
wells and that there other ways for Russia to manage under low oil
revenues. The company believes that the balance of the rouble and the
dollar is the key. If oil prices stay at $15 per barrel and the
government and the central bank decide to devalue the rouble to 33-35
per dollar, currently at 30, it would be equal to the price of $21-22
per barrel.

Russian Oil Companies See No Reason to Back OPEC Cuts

    The reborn Russian oil industry, which almost fell to ruin after
the Soviet Union toppled, may soon find itself involved in an price
war with OPEC. The cartel has trimmed output 3 times so far this year
and says it won't cut more unless Russia cooperates with significant
reductions of its own. However, the former communist country does not
appear willing to cooperate, despite a 45% plunge in prices from a
year ago, offering a token cut of 30,000 bpd from its 7 million bpd
production. Former state-owned companies in Russia have boosted oil
output by resurrecting fields in Siberia. Higher oil prices over the
last 2 years aided the turnaround in the Russian oil industry,
providing funding for new drilling and boosting production. After
communism fell, many companies were acquired cheaply by influential
members of the previous regime, who exhibit a reluctance to slice
output even with oil prices around $17.50 per barrel as they try to
boost their global market share. Some in Russia say that $16  $22 per
barrel is a fair price and that the country should work with Norway
and the EU to maintain that price. Traders say they do not expect any
significant reductions from Russia. Although the government maintains
leverage over its oil companies by controlling export pipelines, the
current administration has set its sights on improving relations with
the US, which many think want cheaper oil. The country has a
population of 150 million and exports only 33% of its oil and 19% of
refined products, which can be shipped by railways and tankers,
bypassing state-controlled pipelines.

Chemical Stocks Rally on Lower Oil Prices

    Tumbling oil prices may give some relief to the chemical industry
in its worst downturn in nearly two decades, although the boost may
not be enough to offset already crippled demand. Chemical stocks have
rallied since oil prices began a steady decline to two-year lows in
mid-September. Shares of the larger companies have gained about 20%,
while the Standard & Poor's chemical composite index is up more than
9%. The rally occurred despite a dismal 3rd quarter results.  Crude
oil prices plunged last Thursday and hit 2-year lows.

FERC Reconsiders Maryland LNG Plant


    The FERC has concluded a conference with state and local
officials on national security concerns associated with re-opening
the Cove Point LNG plant, which is 3.5 miles from the Calvert Cliffs
nuclear power plant in southern Maryland. The commission had given
Williams permission to restart the plant last month. However,
concerns about possible sabotage on tankers from Algeria or other
foreign countries, under foreign flags with foreign crews, delivering
LNG to the plant prompted the commission to re-think its decision.
The conference was closed to the public because of the security-
sensitive nature of the subject being discussed. A tanker carrying
LNG was recently the focal point of a public battle between local and
federal officials. The Coast Guard had closed Boston's Harbor to the
tanker following the September 11th attacks because of worries that
the highly flammable substance could cause mass destruction if it
became the target of a terrorist attack. The Coast Guard eventually
decided to allow the tanker to be unloaded, but Boston's mayor was
outraged and proceeded with legal action, which was denied.
Washington Gas, whose customers are served by the Cove Point
pipeline, said that communications should be improved between the LNG
plant and state and federal officials in case of a threat. In FERC's
approval last month, it ordered the facility to establish a direct
independent communication link with staff at the nuclear power plant,
and develop a backup plan.

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Do you want me to call it a transfer or a data correction?  Also, what effective date should I use?  

I think we should use Jan. 1st for all corrections if we are changing company number to be on the safe side with regard to the employees' tax deductions.  Let me know what you think.  We will probably get many co./cost center change requests for the new year.  

Thanks,

Jean,

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Thanks, Mike

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean

Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

	I think it would be very prudent to put something on the WEB.  We talked about this at the
	Winter Ops meeting and it would be good to have another reminder.

	John, would you work with Michelle and Bill to get a posting on the WEB since I will be
	out of town.  Thanks. Lynn

	Bill & Lynn - What do you think of Ranelle's suggestion regarding a notice on the Website?

	Linda - Will these points be inactivated in the POI system effective Nov. 1?  

	Please advise  MW

Michele,
I just found a note that I had written to myself about posting on the web site a notice to remind the Reverse Auction shippers that effective Nov. 1, they wouldn't be able to nominate to the Reverse Auction point anymore.  It may be worth it to check with Bill Fowler and/or Lynn Blair to see if they think this would be beneficial.  Do you want to follow up on this?

Dear Trial Subscriber: The good folks at Kiodex forwarded to us a new white paper on trading risk management, "The Effective Energy Risk Management Program: Design and Implementation." They were kind enough top allow us to forward the new work on to subscribers -- the file is attached along with the necessary links. The paper was prepared to coincide with the official launch of it's hosted risk management application services, the RiskWorkbench, a product we've covered on a number of occasions. We plan to also run a feature with company CEO Martin Chavez this week as well. Until then, enjoy the white paper -- a very good read.

Sheila,

Please add Reliant to the list of unhappy campers.  Terry Wilson and Tom Acton called to complain last week.  Both are now working with the new report and downloading it to Excel, but expressed reservations about losing the old format.

Sorry that I missed John's count on this.

Janet

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

Crude Oil Futures Rally on Anticipated OPEC Cut

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX climbed $1.65 to
$21.27 per barrel yesterday in its biggest gain in over a year amid
signs that OPEC will proceed with plans to cut production by 1.5
million bpd in a bid to lift sagging crude prices. To avoid losing
market share, the cartel had demanded that non-OPEC producers
contribute a cut of 500,000 bpd between them before it would make any
further slices in its own production. So far, Russia, Mexico, Norway,
Oman and Angola have committed to a combined 462,500 curb in exports,
which appears to be enough to allow OPEC to go ahead with their
plans. The ministers are scheduled to meet in Cairo on Friday and are
expected to take that opportunity to announce their cut. The IEA
projects that world demand will rise by 600,000 bpd next year, about
30% below the average annual gain during the 1990's, as the largest
oil consumers, the US and Japan are mired in a recession. The CFTC
has reported that traders sold more crude oil futures contracts on
the NYMEX than they bought in the week ended December 18th, producing
the highest net short position levels since the contracts began
trading in 1983. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the
NYMEX jumped $0.0462, or 8.4%, to $0.5946 per gallon as colder
weather arrived in most of the eastern portion of the US. The
increase in heating oil was the biggest gain since last April.
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0427 to $0.6013 per
gallon. In London, the IPE was closed in observance of Boxing Day.

World Heating Fuel Projections


    The eastern half of the US will continue to experience colder
weather for the next several days resulting in strong heating fuel
consumption. Temperatures are expected to be 8 to 16 degrees below
average from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic region southward
to the Gulf of Mexico. New England, the upper Midwest and the
northern Plains will be a little milder than normal, but heating fuel
demand will remain higher than usual. Mild weather is expected
throughout the western states decreasing demand for heating fuel. In
Canada, above normal temperatures into early January will keep
heating fuel consumption lower than normal. A cool-weather bias will
remain in far southeastern Canada for the several days producing
above normal demand for heating fuels. Milder weather in western
Europe will significantly reduce heating fuel consumption during the
next 7 to 10 days. In the UK and France, temperatures will be close
to normal through January 5th. Germany and eastern Europe will
experience colder temperatures, but some reduction in heating fuels
demand will occur. Temperatures in Scandinavia will average from 4 to
8 degrees Celsius below normal producing strong heating oil
consumption through early January. China's weather will continue to
be colder than usual, with temperatures expected to average from 4 to
8 degrees Celsius below normal for the next 10 days. Japans usage of
heating fuel is projected to higher than normal through January 5th.
Most of the country will be 2 to 5 degrees Celsius below average.

Saudi Minister Says OPEC to Announce Cuts in Cairo

    Comments made by the Saudi oil minister seem to indicate that
OPEC is ready to go ahead with a planned production cut of 1.5
million bpd after receiving commitments from non-member producers to
also reduce exports. The minister said that OPEC would announce the
reductions at a meeting in Cairo on Friday. The remarks put an end to
a threatened price war between the cartel and non-OPEC producers. The
cartel had accused the non-aligned producers of taking advantage of
curbs already implemented this year by OPEC to grab a larger share of
the market. The cartel had demanded that the non-member producing
countries trim 500,000 bpd from exports before it would once again
slice production. To date Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Angola
have pledged cuts totaling 462,500 bpd, which appears to be enough to
convince OPEC to proceed with its cut. The ministers also seem to be
comfortable with the level of commitment by the non-members to stick
to their quotas for the specified 6-month period. The new
restrictions will lower exports for 10 OPEC producers to 21.7 million
bpd, down 5 million bpd or 19% from a year ago, the lowest level in
10 years. Iraq, the 11th member produces at will because of UN
sanctions. The new supply limits are designed to lift prices back to
$20-$25 per barrel for the basket of OPEC crude oils.

Philadelphia Oil Service Index Climbs to August Levels

    The Philadelphia Oil Service Index climbed as high as 89.85, its
highest level since August, closing at 89.41, up 3.8% yesterday.
Shares of Rowan added $0.77 to $19.70 and Schlumberger stocks gained
$2.85 to $55.95. Integrated oil stocks also gained, as the CBOE Oil
Index was up 1.3% to 300.2. ChevronTexaco rose $0.65 to $89.20 and
ExxonMobil advanced $0.60 cents to $39.60. On the NYMEX, February
crude oil rose to session high at $21.43 per barrel, its highest
level in 6 weeks. It closed at $21.27, up $1.65, or 8.6%.
Expectations that OPEC will proceed with a planned production cut of
1.5 million bpd at a meeting in Cairo on Friday likely gave the
market a lift. Although non-OPEC producers are a little short of the
500,000 bpd reduction that OPEC demanded, it appears that they came
close enough, with a combined pledge to cut 462,500 bpd, to satisfy
the cartel.

Egypt Increases Oil Reserves

    Egypt's Oil Ministry says new oil and condensate finds with
recoverable reserves of 178 million barrels, and natural gas reserves
of 1.5 Tcf have been discovered. About 15 wells had been drilled, of
which 7 were now producing at a total of 16,000 bpd.  The oil
discoveries were made in the Gulf of Suez and the country's western
and eastern deserts, and the natural gas discoveries were made in the
Nile Delta area, western desert and in the Mediterranean sea. Egypt
produced about 640,000 barrels of oil per day in November. It has
proven natural gas reserves of 53.3 Tcf, and oil reserves of 3.8
billion barrels.

UDS Refinery Restart Delayed

    Ultramar Diamond Shamrock has run into problems trying to restart
the fluid catalytic cracker at its Golden Eagle refinery near San
Francisco following scheduled maintenance work. The catalytic cracker
and an alkylation unit had to be closed down, contributing to a rise
in wholesale gasoline prices in the area. A new attempt to restart
the FCC is expected today. UDS announced in November that it had
shutdown the FCC at the 170,000 bpd refinery for scheduled
maintenance work and that would be followed by maintenance work on
the hydrocracker at the same refinery. Wholesale CARB gasoline prices
in San Francisco rose by over $0.04 per gallon yesterday.

Taiwan Deregulates Oil Market

     Taiwan's economics ministry has announced the full opening of
the oil market to foreign-refined products, heaping pressure on state-
run giant Chinese Petroleum Corp to speed up deregulation. The
privatization of Taiwan's oil products came after passage of the oil
management law in September, which would open the floodgates to
imports of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, and expand the island
nation's already crowded energy market. After the opening, any
company, which has facilities to store 60 days of reserves or 50
million liters of the oil products, is allowed to buy them from
foreign refiners, said the Energy Commission. In 1999, the government
cut restrictions on imports of jet fuel, fuel oil and LPG as part of
its drive to meet requirements for entry into the WTO. The complete
deregulation was set to further erode market share of dominant
supplier CPC. CPC, faced with a saturated domestic market and
increasing competition, will have to accelerate its privatization or
see a further erosion of dominance in the local oil market. CPC says
it plans to sell as much as a 50% stake overseas in the second half
of 2002.

Mullinville Turbine - The turbine is available at this time, but they would like about 3 hours notice. They would like to do the turbine exchange next week if the system loads allow. This is the unit that was repaired in California. The one installed right now is a rental, and has to be returned by the first of the year.

Cunningham - They are doing their re-wiring of the PLC today and tomorrow. They can still inject or withdraw at this time. Thursday or Friday they would like to test the wiring job by actuating some valves. The station would have to been down 8 hours or so to do that. I told Rusty it will depend on the system requirements at that time.

Plainview Turbine - They started Monday installing the new starter and controls. They should have the work complete by Friday 11/30 if all goes well.

P3 Gray Co. - The tie-in for the new Gray Co. I/C is still scheduled for 11/29, and 11/30. P3 will be down during this outage. They will still be able to by-pass gas by the station.

If you have any questions give me a call.

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-
Gary

Ramona,
The user acceptance testing is schedule for 10/22 thru 11/02.  I am not sure why the model office refresh should be an issue.  we should be able to postpone the refresh for until after the production migration.
I will make the change in my project plan for user testing to finish on 11/01, this will still put for implementation the weekend of 11/03.

thanks

Hasan,
I could not open this file. Gerry printed it for me. I was not sure I followed the test plan. Is it testing from Oct. 19th to Nov. 2nd?
Since we will have a new model office refresh to deal with on the Oct. 31st, we would like to push to be complete with testing by Wednesday. Oct. 31st, and plan for Thursday night migration which is Nov. 1st.

I will have Kathy Washington, Maggie Matheson, and myself testing for the next two weeks beginning Monday Oct. 22 nd testing through Nov. 1st. Will that work for your team? Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the project plan for TMS migration to SQL2K.

Couple of key items to note.  In order to create an implementation date, I took the liberty of allocating 2 weeks for user testing.  This could change based on customer input.  Additionally, Model Office refresh is very critical.  I have tentatively scheduled it for 10/17 and 10/18.  Any changes to either the Model office refresh dates or the testing schedule will impacting the implementation date.

thanks

Cara is working on updating the report to accommodate the volumes impacted. Cara will add the "From" and "To" volumes as well as the difference.

	How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?

	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Larry

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26"Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Joe and Sherry

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

James,

As soon as we have a revised PPA invoice for October that we feel will be the final info, could you fax a copy to me.  The customer is waiting for some other data from me that uses SMS and DDVC amounts for the past year, and I cannot finish the info for him until we have this resolved.  I'd like to call him and give him an update.  Do you know approximately when we might have the revised PPA?

Thanks,

Joni

Crude Oil Futures Rise as US Urges Tighter Controls on Iraq

    Crude oil rose as much as 1.4% yesterday as the US renewed
efforts to force Iraq to allow more weapons inspections, raising
concern OPEC's 4th-biggest oil producer may temporarily halt
shipments in retaliation. President Bush said the war in Afghanistan
is only the beginning of his fight on terrorism and urged Iraq to
accept a change to trade sanctions that would tighten control of
weapons supply. That may prompt Iraq to refuse to renew a 6-month oil-
for-food program that expires Friday. Crude oil for January delivery
rose as much as $0.27 to $18.96 per barrel in after-hours NYMEX
electronic trading. Oil prices have dropped 29% in the past 3 months
as economic slowdown reduced demand. In London, Brent crude oil on
the IPE fell $0.92 cents yesterday, or 4.8%, to $18.36 per barrel
because of OPEC's failure to persuade Russia to agree to bigger
production cuts.

Dolphin Gas Project Moving Ahead

    Qatar and Abu Dhabi are expected to sign a $3.5 billion agreement
on the inter-Gulf Dolphin natural gas project within a week.
Bureaucracy and red-tape had delayed the final signing of a
development and production sharing agreement. The DPSA will allow the
project sponsor, Dolphin Energy Ltd, to produce up to 2 Bcf per day
from a North Field block and transport it via an sub-sea pipeline to
Abu Dhabi initially. A 2nd phase would increase production to 3 Bcf
per day. DEL will spend $2 billion to drill about 16 wells and build
a production platform and treatment facilities and provide an
additional $1.5 billion for the construction of a 350 km, undersea
pipeline from Qatar to Taweelah, Abu Dhabi. Qatar will own all the
condensate, sulfur, NGL and LPG, extracted from the wet gas, and
charge $1.30 per MMBtu for the dry gas, which will be exported by
DEL. The first delivery of gas to Taweelah is expected in about 2
years. DEL is expected to appoint a financial adviser for the project
soon and select a partner to replace Enron, which pulled out of the
project. State-owned UAE Offsets Group, which holds a 75.5% stake in
DEL, has asked Exxon Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, Conoco and
Occidental to submit bids for a 24.5% stake in the project,
previously held by Enron. The selected firm will be in charge of the
building and operation of the subsea pipeline. France's TotalFinaElf,
which also holds a 24.5% share, will oversee the upstream section of
the project.

Angolan LNG Plant May Be Delayed

    A proposed $2 billion liquid natural gas plant in Angola has been
delayed by at least a year due to the merger between Chevron and
Texaco and the possible addition of new partners in the project.
Texaco, which launched the project about 3 years ago, had scheduled
the plant opening in 2005, but it will now likely be 2006.
ChevronTexaco and state oil company, Sonangol, expects to announce
project partners before entering the engineering and design phase in
the next few months. The partners are expected to be BP, TotalFinaElf
and ExxonMobil, all of which operate several offshore blocks
northeast of the capital, Luanda. The LNG plant will be built on a
refinery site operated by TotalFinaElf in northern Luanda. The site 
has capacity for four trains. The refinery and the 4 million tonne
per year LNG plant would save by sharing water, security and other
services. ChevronTexaco produces about 600,000 bpd of Angola's total
750,000 bpd output. Since the merger was approved last month, the
companies have been mapping out the new companies projects and it is
still not clear what priority will be given to the project. Angola is
expected to grant approval quickly because of concerns about properly
using its gas reserves and eliminating flaring. The gas will be
marketed in Europe and the Americas, but will face tough competition
from countries such as Nigeria, which leads Angola in sub-Sahara oil
production.

FBI Warns of Possible Pipeline Attacks

    The FBI has warned oil and natural gas companies that Osama bin
Laden may have called for an attack on US natural gas facilities if
he is captured or killed. Federal investigators received a report of
undetermined reliability that natural gas supplies could be targeted.
Energy companies already have increased security at pipelines,
refineries, nuclear power plants and other facilities.

Possible Law Suits Could Threaten OPEC Production Cut


    If oil companies like Venezuela's PDVSA, Mexico's Pemex, Norway's
Statoil and Russia's Lukoil join OPEC in cutting exports in order to
lift oil prices, they could become the target of lawsuits by airlines
for price fixing. If the proposed cut in exports is judged to be an
illegal conspiracy under US antitrust statutes, direct purchasers
could sue for treble damages. Citgo could be a target because it
sells jet fuel directly to airlines. It has been rumored that at
least 2 airlines are considering legal action. Such an action would
certainly be a threat to OPEC's plans to cut another 1.5 million bpd
to raise sagging prices, but the deal hinges on the cooperation of
non-OPEC producers. Private companies exposure to legal action would
be greater than OPEC states, which claim exemption from antitrust
laws as sovereign nations. Private lawsuits could prevent accused oil
firms from operating in US capital markets or acquiring US assets.

Baker Hughes Rig Counts

    The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US
fell by 7 to 986 last week, according to Baker Hughes.  There were
1064 a year ago. The number of rigs exploring in Canada was down 14
to 254, compared to 380 last year. The number in the Gulf of Mexico
was unchanged at 129, compared to 141 a year ago. The number of rigs
searching on land was 832, down 8, and the number of offshore rigs
was steady at 134. There were 20 inland rigs, up one. The total North
American rig count dropped by 21 to 1,240, compared to 1,444 a year
ago. The number of rigs searching for oil fell by 1 to 172, and the
number searching for natural gas dipped 6 to 814.

Michele, 
Under the Accounting Procedures section, the second bullet states: "Northern will account for any costs of third party transportation service through general ledger Account 858 - Transmission and Compression of Gas by Others".  I propose that NNG use Account 859 - Other (Transmission) Expense rather than Account 858 for these third party transportation service costs.  
The Code of Regs states for Acct 858, "This account shall include amounts paid to others for the transmission and compression of gas of the utility."  However, it is specifically stated in the second paragraph of your Offsystem Capacity procedures, "Northern will not hold title to any natural gas stored or transported on a third party facility."  Thus, the use of Account 858 contradicts NNG's intent of not taking possession of the gas.  
Also, the use of Account 859  for transportation service costs would be very consistent with the use of Account 824 for storage service costs.  The Code of Regs description of the types of expenses to be included in each account is almost identical with the exception of the words "storage" and "transmission system", to wit,
"824 - Other expenses:  This account shall include the cost of labor, material used and expenses incurred in operating underground storage plant, and other underground storage operating expenses, not includible in any of the foregoing accounts, including research, development, and demonstration expenses."
"859 - Other expenses:  This account shall include the cost of labor, material used and expenses incurred in operating transmission system equipment and other transmission system expenses not includible in any of the foregoing accounts, including research, development, and demonstration expenses."

	on the WEB, which is a commitment we have made to our customers.

	Please ensure you do NOT change any coverage after the Process meeting.
	You should have the right information going into Monday's meeting.

	It does not look good to continually repost this information.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	"The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows."

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

Lynn,

Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?

Thanks,

Sue

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

     [IMAGE]GEORGE CLOONEY'S BIZARRE MARRIAGE & WACKY DIVORCE     [IMAGE]  =
[IMAGE] GEORGE CLOONEY was once married, and some of his friends had no ide=
a.   No wonder George Clooney has become a confirmed bachelor - his only ma=
rriage didn't last as long as the divorce wrangling!   Clooney wed actor Ma=
rtin Balsam's daughter Talia on Dec. 15, 1989, and they separated 20 months=
 later. But it took 25 months before the divorce decree became final in Sep=
tember 1993.   The couple fought long and hard in court over their communit=
y property - including George's prize possession, a potbellied pig named Ma=
x.   "George wound up getting Max although Talia had become very fond of hi=
m," Talia's uncle, actor Dick Van Patten, told The ENQUIRER. "They fought o=
ver that - it was like a child custody battle!   "George didn't treat Talia=
 badly during the marriage. I remember he took her to Vegas for their honey=
moon. But after they were wed he just decided, 'I guess I shouldn't have go=
tten married. I didn't know what this marriage business was like.'   "It wa=
s too confining for him."   At the time of the marriage, George, now 40, wa=
s a struggling actor who was "pursuing stardom with a vengeance, but Talia =
wanted a more traditional marriage so she was not at all that supportive," =
a close friend revealed.   "Over the course of their marriage, they continu=
ed to grow apart because they could not find a compromise. Eventually, Geor=
ge started getting better and better roles and people started to really not=
ice him - especially women.   "George and Talia began arguing more often be=
cause he wasn't home a lot, so they finally decided it would be best for bo=
th of them if they divorced.   "That's when things got really ugly. George =
was furious when Talia - whose family had money - insisted she get all the =
furniture and other household goods because as a struggling actor, it took =
him a long time to acquire those things."   In the end, Clooney got a baby =
grand piano, a 1959 Corvette, a 1983 Harley, a l988 Saab and a 1991 motor h=
ome, plus the money in four bank accounts, interests in partnerships, stock=
s and a Studio City house.   Talia got $95,000 in cash from George, her jew=
elry, some bank accounts and a 1988 Dodge.   Each was allowed to keep whate=
ver "furniture, furnishings, artwork, antiques, fixtures, personal mementos=
, household equipment and appliances, crystal, china, flatware and linens c=
urrently in (their) possession," according to court papers.   Said the frie=
nd: "That whole experience didn't turn George off women, but it did turn hi=
m off to getting married again."   Even while he was married, George always=
 acted very much like a single guy, say sources.   "I had no idea there was=
 a Mrs. Clooney," said a waitress at Du-Par's restaurant, where Clooney was=
 a fixture. "Nobody did.    "He was in here all the time with a group of bu=
ddies. He was the quintessential single guy."   And a former neighbor in St=
udio City disclosed: "We all remember the pig, but most people had no idea =
George was married.   "Some days he kept the pig in the yard outside. Some =
neighbors complained it smelled. It never bothered me. It just snorted at n=
ight sometimes.   "But as for his wife - I never saw her. Then she was gone=
 and he lived there with a few buddies."   Talia married actor John Slatter=
y in 1998, and they live happily in New York City.   Said a New York pal: "=
Talia's husband is gorgeous, he makes her laugh. They're really connected. =
So I'd say she's done pretty well since George. I don't think she's crying =
over him at all."   [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]HA=

Crude Oil Futures Fall on OPEC Stalemate with Russia


    Crude oil futures for January delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.18
to $18.96 per barrel on Wednesday. Global oil prices climbed on
Thursday after Russia indicated it was willing to make larger cuts
than its previously announced 30,000 bpd. But on Friday, Russia said
it would cut 50,000 bpd for the 4th quarter, but made no future
commitments to curb production, which produced another drop in global
oil prices. However, the former Soviet country said further cuts were
possible before its December 10th deadline for setting next years
production levels. Although, Russia's top economic advisor said that
it would be ridiculous to try to lift oil prices when the world was
entering a recession. In response to bulging crude oil inventories,
plummeting demand and prices, OPEC was expected to cut production by
up to 1.5 million bpd at its Vienna meeting last week, but instead
said it will not make any cuts in production without a meaningful
slice in Russian output. The cartel has sought cooperation from non-
OPEC members, specifically Russia, Norway and Mexico to trim exports
by a combined 500,000 bpd. So far, the organization has received
pledges from Mexico and Norway to reduce production by 100,000 and
200,000 bpd respectively. December gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell
0.0008 to $0.5273 per gallon on Wednesday. Heating oil futures for
December delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.0034 to $0.5342 per gallon. In
London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery climbed $1.17 to
$19.90 per barrel on Thursday, but were down $0.62 to $19.28 per
barrel on Friday.

LPG Unit at Texas Refinery Explodes


Witnesses say a huge fire-ball erupted over the 100,000 bpd Crown
Central Petroleum oil refinery in Pasadena, TX last Friday. Damage
was limited to the liquefied petroleum gas unit where the explosion
occurred. The privately held Crown Central said the blast occurred
during early phases of a scheduled 4-week maintenance period at its
Houston Ship Channel refinery. Although none of the refinery's other
units seemed to have been damaged, the whole plant was closed down as
a precautionary measure.

Russia Becomes Lone Hold-Out

    In yet another attempt to convince Russia to commit to
significant output curbs, OPEC is calling on non-members to cooperate
in an effort to lift sinking oil prices. OPEC has said it will not
act alone in reducing exports. Earlier this month, the cartel said it
would trim production by 1.5 million bpd if non-members such as
Mexico, Norway and Russia contribute another 500,000 bpd. Mexico has
said it would make an 100,000 bpd cut. And last week Norway chimed in
with pledge of a 200,000 bpd reduction. But so far, Russia, the
worlds 2nd largest oil producer does not seem inclined to join the
party, despite raising their planned output reduction to 50,000 bpd
from a previously announced 30,000 bpd. OPEC's secretary general says
the organization is working to prevent a catastrophe in oil prices.

Lawsuit Filed Over Phillips, Conoco Merger

    Conoco has been sued over a planned $15.4 billion merger with
Phillips to form the 3rd largest US oil company. The lawsuit contends
that the merger undervalues Conoco shares. The deal would exchange
0.4677 share of the new company for each Conoco share. Shares of
Conoco were up $0.54 to $27.30 per share last week while shares of
Phillips gained $0.72 to $55.00, valuing Conoco at $25.72 relative to
Phillips. Conoco shares have seen an 8.1% increase from $24.30 per
share on November 16th, just before the merger was announced. The
lawsuit alleges that Conocos directors failed to fulfill their
obligations by not properly seeking the best alternative for its
shareholders. The suit also contends that the transaction includes no
premium for Conoco shareholders and also seeks class-action status
and an order forcing directors to explore available alternatives to
the deal.

Arctic Drilling Effected by Lower Natural Gas Prices

     The drilling industry ready for an active winter season on the
tundra of Canada's far north, but low natural gas prices and a weak
economy have lowered expectations of a boom time. Most companies such
as Petro-Canada and Paramount Resources  are pressing ahead with
exploration in the rugged Northwest Territories. Due to marshy
conditions for the rest of the year, wells are drilled in winter when
the ground freezes. Petro-Canada plans to drill three 9,840-foot deep
wells in the Mackenzie Delta and Paramount intends to drill two wells 
farther south, near Fort Liard, below the Arctic Circle. The region
could hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. In recent
federally supervised land sales, producers committed to spending
C$650 million on exploration over the next few years just in the
Mackenzie Delta. But some wells in theYukon and the Northwest
Territories' central Mackenzie Valley have been canceled or delayed
by Canadian Natural Resources. But the troubled economy and the drop
in prices from $10 per MMBtu last January are having an impact. Akita
Drilling is keeping two new rigs in Alberta this winter and delaying
the move of the C$18 million units to the Mackenzie Delta until later
in 2002. Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Conoco are studying building
a C$3 billion pipeline to transport about a Bcf per day of Arctic
volumes to southern Canada and the US.

Nigeria Orders Oil Meeting Cancelled


      Nigeria has ordered British and US diplomats to cancel a
meeting with the governors of the West African nation's oil-producing
states, calling it a threat its sovereignty. Nigeria's minister of
state for foreign affairs summoned the US ambassador and British
Deputy High Commissioner to tell them the meeting scheduled for today
must be called off. British and American diplomats said the meeting
never meant to undermine the central government. The meeting was to
share information with the governors on some environmental issues
that would be beneficial to the oil producing communities. Royal
Dutch Shell is Nigeria's largest producer accounting for about half
of the country's daily crude oil output of about two million barrels,
followed by ExxonMobil, which pumps about 620,000 bpd. Nigeria's oil-
producing states and the federal government have been fighting over
control of its oil resources.

Duke to Import Natural Gas to Italy

  Duke Energy is selling natural gas and electricity into the Italian
market via its energy trading business, and could also bid for one of
the generating companies to be sold by Enel. Duke's effort to boost
its presence in Italy includes plans to open offices in Milan.  Duke
is interested in acquiring generating capacity in the Italian market,
either through acquisitions or contracts involving the rental of
generators. If Duke does actually bid for generating capacity, its
target would be Interpower, the third of a group of generating units
that Italian power giant Enel is selling off to comply with EU rules
aimed at fostering competition in Italy's energy market.

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a "handbook" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

After the latest discussion with Dennis, I notified Gary Weihrauch that we would need a copy of the amended Certificate of Incorporation.  He is expecting to receive this from his legal department this afternoon.  He will then fax this copy to me -- Dennis, I will walk it down to you.

Am I correct is assuming the credit clearance is handled elsewhere?

Thanks,
S.

We have received a letter from Gary Weihrauch advising of the name and Duns change for the above.  I will bring copies down to your desks immediately.  

After your review, please advise if I need to obtain further information.  I realize time is very short to accomplish this by November 1st.  Thanks for your help.

We have not yet received the appropriate paperwork.  November 1 is the EARLIEST we can make the name change assuming we receive the paperwork and we get the proper credit approval.  I understand there will also be a DUNS number change.  If this is true, we need to notify all our shippers a minimum of 5 days in advance.  

We'll push the name change through as quickly as possible, but we can't do it until our ducks are in a row.

Subject:	TransCanada --fyi, Upcoming Name Change

As most of you know, BP purchased the gas and power marketing division of TransCanada effective October 1st.  The legal entity and name change will go into our system November 1st.  My understanding is the appropriate documentation has already been sent to our offices.

In the event, anyone telephones them, the receptionists in their Omaha offices now answer the telephone as BP Gas & Power.  The legal name actually is BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp.  To date, it appears there have been no other changes with scheduling and accounting personnel.

Should there be any questions, please let me know -- thanks.

Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what that address is and we'll get you set up.

Thanks!
Vernon

Vernon:
We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

Greg

The Help Desk did not receive calls on either of these items this morning.  That is positive and demonstrates that we have a process in place to resolve issues before a customer places a call.  

I do think it is important to know; 1.) how were these resolved?  2.) what caused them and how can they be avoided in the future?  

Brad

All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

As indicated below, there was a problem with the server configuration last night.  It appears that when one part of the system encountered a problem and failed over to the backup as it should have, there was a problem with the system security.  ENW management has assured us that they are taking a closer look at the cause of the problem we experienced, so they can determine a long-term solution to minimize future downtime.

Subject:	All tests were NOT successfully executed


All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

FYI,

I got a call form Larry at Bushton. He said they having trouble with a pump in the treater plant. They haven't received the spare pump yet, so there could be a possibility that the treater plant could be down this weekend. Which means Lyons would be down. They just wanted to give us a heads up, so we can figure this in our weekend plan.

Jerry

FYI.  We will still need to check into analog lines, and if there is a charge for the phones.

Jean:  I went through the configuration in the PBX out at the Aviation hangar and it should meet your needs with its current configuration.  I have enough spare ports to support up to 50 phones.  They also have their own voicemail system. We would however, have to provide the phones, but we should have enough in stock to prevent us from having to order more.  As mentioned in my voicemail, it is a completely stand alone system that does not require the downtown site to be operational.  If you guys decide to go this route, we will also have to look at the cabling out there to make sure that it would meet your needs.  I know at one time they had looked at making that a disaster recovery site for Enron, so I believe that is why it is sized the way it is.  Let me know if you have additional questions.  Thanks!

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the "macro" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I contacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a business reason and director level approval is required before any restoration work can begin. 
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sheet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. In addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track potential imbalance activity on NNG's system. 
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the restoration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can continue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Departments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.
Thanks,
Mike

I vote for Wednesday.  As you mention, we would be sure that Continental is running.  It would also be financially beneficial for Oneok to wait.

Guess we better look at turning the C line around on the 31st, or should we wait until the 2nd, to make sure they get up? sj

I know most of you have read Shelley's email about the Performance Review process for year end.  I apologize for the short turnaround and that we have not had time to set down and
talk about the changes we are making.  I do believe the changes will be very beneficial and bring us a step closer to enhancing the process. 
 
I know you have a lot of questions and therefore on Tuesday, November 27, I will replace my team leader meeting with 3 meetings, one for each team.  I will start the first meeting at 1:30 p.m. In the meantime, if you have any questions that need to be answered immediately, please get with John or Terry and they will get you the answers.  Remember we are trying to simplify the process for everyone as well as getting valuable feedback on each employee.
 
In the meantime, please be thinking about your four selections and submit them by Tuesday, November 27th
at 5:00 p.m.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving and I'll see you on Tuesday.  Lynn

According to members of the Beatrice management team the timeliness of chart changing activities in the Beatrice Region is not an issue.  Is this truly the case?  If not, please provide me a list of facilities in the Beatrice Region where this is an issue.

Thanks,

	I spoke with Steve Kirk regarding this issue.  On May 3, 2001, the Reverse Auction shippers were notified that the Reverse Auction Pool POI  would be terminated November 1 and a revised Appendix A for the contracts setting forth the specific allocations of entitlement at Ventura, Welcome and Aberdeen points were provided to the shippers.  Therefore, the notice on the website would only need to remind shippers that the Reverse Auction Pool will terminate effective November 1, 2001.  We would recommend that the following notice be posted at anytime. 

	Reminder: The Reverse Auction Pool POI 60460 will be terminated November 1, 2001.

	Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.  Thanks MW

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Yes, we were successful in getting a transporter to step in.  This starts tomorrow - however I am in talks with regulatory on what to do on the days between 12/3 - 12/20.  Also, we are not going to grant an OBA at this point at this time.

Thanks!

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

Your Inspiration:  Treasures

There are treasures in life,
but owners are few
Of money and power
to buy things brand new.

Yet you can be wealthy
and feel regal too,
If you will just look
for the treasures in you.

These treasures in life
are not hard to find
When you look in your heart,
your soul, and your mind.

For when you are willing
to share what's within,
Your fervent search
for riches will end.

The joy and the laughter,
the smile that you bring;
The heart unafraid
to love and to sing;

The hand always willing
to help those in need;
Ones quick to reach out,
to labor and fee.

So thank you for sharing
these great gifts inside;
The caring, the cheering,
the hug when one cried.

Thanks for the energy,
encouragement too,
And thank you for sharing
the treasures in you.

At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were di=
scussed:

Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):

Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications =
[CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received =
certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w=
ho charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheele=
r Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh =
"any potential adverse impact to existing customers?" and that "the solutio=
n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in=
terstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity o=
n SoCalGas?."  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o=
bligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity "c=
annot be laid at [Kern River's] door."

Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor=
tant issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak=
e-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't=
 dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance =
of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o=
f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi=
ty for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is "uneasy" about FER=
C's "strident policies" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss=
ible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate=
 under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She =
notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in anot=
her Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].

Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus=
pice of "Electricity Market Design and Structure" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on age=
nda)

Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discu=
ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th=
ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t=
o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need f=
or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co=
mmissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brown=
ell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, wi=
th the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the m=
agnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff =
work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, =
bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement =
a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's prop=
osal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of "p=
rocess" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev=
eloped "in a way that gets us to an endgame" concretely and clearly.

Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in=
 Seattle

Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g=
athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infra=
structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences=
 will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC "=
fact-finding mission" which will seek to answer three primary questions:
(1)=09=09Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?
(2)=09What are the infrastructure needs for the region?
(3)=09What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy=
 infrastructure?

While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, t=
he conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding quest=
ion on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The po=
werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's websit=
e at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm=
>
=20
"RTO Week" Update=20

Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a=
t FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining "=
what Staff heard," which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The d=
ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Sta=
ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused St=
aff sessions to "dig deeper?."  According to Staff, while there seemed to b=
e some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerge=
d which may require further discussion.

Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast)=
, Midwest RTO Progress

In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating=
 Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off,=
 what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may b=
e necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of w=
eek).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - =
there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.

In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and S=
PP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of =
all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given =
as to when a vote may occur.

ETS Draft Orders Issued:

?=09Northern Natural, RP00-223-005:  Northern's Limited Firm Transportation=
 ["LFT"] tariff sheets were approved, including two additional LFT sheets c=
oncerning the Carlton surcharge.
?=09Calypso, CP01-444-000:  Letters issued to Secretary of State, Secretary=
 of Defense requesting review of draft Presidential Permit for Calypso to c=
onstruct, own and operate pipeline facilities at the boundary of the U.S. E=
xclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] and the Bahamas EEZ.

Subject:	GPM Dumas Plant Information

I talked to Lavila Lawrence with Duke Energy Field Services, LP. and she advised me that the GPM Dumas Plant (POI 18058) is going to be shutdown effective January 1, 2002.  They will diverting some of the gas to other pipelines and any gas that will be coming to NNG will come through interconnects that David Moon takes care of in the Texas Panhandle.  

Any questions, please call.

All,
our research has yielded a data problem as the cause of K5997 not showing up on the MTD Market Summary Report.  We are working with DBAs to get this resolved.

Just one question, from the contents of the original note, it is not quite clear whether the stated problem manifested on MTD and daily Market Summary reports or just the MTD.

As a side note, I went and looked in Remedy but did not find any ticket for this problem.  Also, I noticed that no one on the TMS support team was copied on the original email.  I would like to strongly encourage everyone to use the TMS production problem reporting procedures that we have in place.

thanks

Subject:	New Contracts - activitated mid month



	We have a new contract for Southern Company K5997 that was activitated effective 12/20/01.  The shipper
	nominated their gas also for the first time on this contract for the 12/20/01 gas day.

	This contract is NOT showing up on our MTD Market Summary or the 12/20 Market Summary?????

	We had  a similar problem right after CMS went into production with another contract; however this one

	appeared on the daily Market Summary; but not the MTD one????

	What type of procedure or fix do we need to implement between CMS/TMS to insure that all contracts

	that are new or newly activitated  mid month bridge over to TMS reports?????

	Suggestions???? Help????

	Thanks Lynda

Guess we better look at turning the C line around on the 31st, or should we wait until the 2nd, to make sure they get up? sj

Bill:  Can you direct me to the person who allocates the Black Marlin delivery meter for Transok.  I think we (NNG) are getting information only for the volumes through the meter for the account of Lamar Power.  Now, since we have only two delivery points, you might think I could subtract - but...I really need to know that the allocations for Lamar Power and AEP sum to the actual meter volume between Transok and NNG.  Can you help?  Steve Weller (713-853-3000)

Lets not forget about a disclaimer to customers about being responsible for their own business and NNG is not responsible for the customers nomination path if they choose a higher priced alternate path.

ETS continues working to solidify the security of our environment.  Several projects are underway which I wanted you to know about.  I also wanted to report incidents ETS' infrastructure prevented that did not cause any business interruption and/or lost revenue.

Desktop Management Initiative (DMI)

We are working with Simon Burgess of Enron Net Works on this desktop management initiative.  ETS leverages Enron Net Works for the scripted delivery of applications to our workstations and laptops.  Given the 1,700+ workstations in ETS' environment, it is rather easy to quantify the value received by leveraging this ENW service.  If you consider the number of applications in our environment that would require visits to each workstation or laptop for installation, the $'s add up quickly in costs that we avoid.  DMI will add additional value to ENW's service of scripted application delivery.  Software metering and Application Management are the main two components delivered by this initiative.  Upon completion, support costs are expected to be reduced and the turnaround time for distributing software packages will be faster.

Project Defender (PD)

Project Defender differs from DMI.  Within PD, we are looking at the configuration settings of all ETS workstations and servers.  Once we validate a workstation or server is a supported ETS asset, we compare it's configuration against published minimum supported standards and report exceptions.  The minimum supported standards are comprised of Corporate mandated standards and ETS required standards for the protection of our environment.  Any exceptions are reported and remedied.

An article in ETS' IT Newsletter describes more about Project Defender.  http://www.ets.enron.com/ITNewsletter/projects/projectdefender112001.asp

These are just 2 of many projects Infrastructure has underway to help improve the stability, reliability and security of our environment.  Look for more communication next month on the continuous improvements being made on connectivity to Omaha and our overall Business Continuity/DR process.

INFRASTRUCTURE PREVENTS

During the month of October, there were two (2) incidents that confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance and pro-active response tools.  These incidents could have had a serious impact to our business, so I thought it important to communicate them and how they were handled which prevented any business impact.

TMS (Throughput Management System)

ETS currently has an EMC disk array that supports some components of the TMS application.  This disk array is targeted for decommission by December 1st, 2001.  The disk array presents four (4) single points of failure for components of the TMS application it supports.  Once decommissioned, these four (4) single points of failure will no longer exist in ETS' environment.

During the week of 10/15, the EMC disk array had 2 power supply failures at the same time.  The array has three (3) total power supplies, so the single, remaining power supply assumed the load while the other power supplies were in a failed state.  The disk array phoned (via internal modem) its support center which in turn, notified our server on-call support member.  Within 4 hours of supply failures, 2 new power supplies were installed in the disk array bringing all 3 power supplies back on-line and in a desired fail over state.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.

RMS (Revenue Management System)
One of the mirrored drives on our production RMS application server (GTHOU-WWRMS01P) failed.  The drive was part of a mirrored set.  Upon failure, the mirrored drive assumed the server load and our Insight Management application reported the failed drive to our server team.  Within 2 hours, the failed drive was replaced.   The drive pair was again in a mirrored state within 6 hours.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.

These are 2 examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents.  I believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of crisis.

Thanks,
-Scott.

It has come to my attention that the Richardson PNR rate was less than previously reported....It also gave me an opportunity to corrected a mathematical error in my original e-mail.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Saturday - All three pipes experienced report problems due to a replication error. Was resolved for the shippers and operators. The IT person is looking into this issue futher for additional fixes.
 
Sunday - All three pipes, "Web site" went down for 40 minutes prior to the Intraday 1 deadline of 10 am. On call Reps. assisted customers by entering noms and confirming for a couple shippers and operators and extended the deadline by 25 minutes. IT person had to reboot the (X-12 Server) to resolve this issue.

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Lynn,

Wisconsin Electric needs to stay with whoever is assigned Wisconsin Gas, the payments for both are sent in under the same wire.

WP&L and Interstate Power are listed under both Jean and Karen.

All else looks good.

Thanks,

Vernon, 
Warrior Gas Company contact is Robert C. (Bob) Lyon - phone 915-688-3838

John Wollaston with Embassy is requesting that you send him a pro forma OBA for his review - his e-mail is: embassy9@home.com

Vernon, Embassy is getting lined out for January business.  They just got caught in the middle of the ENA fallout, but they are anxious to get a resolution for December in place.  Thanks for your help.

The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or scheduled volume.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Subject:	Potential Customer

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean

We have received a letter from Gary Weihrauch advising of the name and Duns change for the above.  I will bring copies down to your desks immediately.  

After your review, please advise if I need to obtain further information.  I realize time is very short to accomplish this by November 1st.  Thanks for your help.

We have not yet received the appropriate paperwork.  November 1 is the EARLIEST we can make the name change assuming we receive the paperwork and we get the proper credit approval.  I understand there will also be a DUNS number change.  If this is true, we need to notify all our shippers a minimum of 5 days in advance.  

We'll push the name change through as quickly as possible, but we can't do it until our ducks are in a row.

As most of you know, BP purchased the gas and power marketing division of TransCanada effective October 1st.  The legal entity and name change will go into our system November 1st.  My understanding is the appropriate documentation has already been sent to our offices.

In the event, anyone telephones them, the receptionists in their Omaha offices now answer the telephone as BP Gas & Power.  The legal name actually is BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp.  To date, it appears there have been no other changes with scheduling and accounting personnel.

Should there be any questions, please let me know -- thanks.

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.
Reyna

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the changes.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October.  If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Would you be able to update us on the status of the SBA priority during Allocations?  September 1st has rolled around really fast.

Thanks,

Reyna,  this is to confirm that the SBA-TI's should be scheduled after primary but before all other nominations.  sjk

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement
	     list.  I like the idea of automating the last bullet.  I am not sure if it is in CMS or elsewhere, but
	     I would like to be sure we pursue this automation.
	Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
Below is a list of issues that were raised at the meeting held w/ Gerry and Reyna (attended by John and I) ......As far as I know, we haven't yet heard back from Sue regarding the issues raised.

....Immediately below is LT's response to adding a "hook" in CMS that would distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements....

More as it develops!

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get "squeezed" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a "point", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as "SBA IT"?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

I vote for Wednesday.  As you mention, we would be sure that Continental is running.  It would also be financially beneficial for Oneok to wait.

Just in case any night owls are planning to access our customer activity site on Wednesday, October 24, HotTap will be unavailable starting at 10:30 p.m. CCT.   

If all goes well, HotTap should be back before midnight.  The worst-case scenario would extend this planned outage till 3:30 a.m. Thursday morning.

Subject:	Shipper Scheduled Quanties Report.

Per my telephone conversation with Toby this morning, I am writing this e:mail to give my comments on
the new Shipper Scheduled Quantities report.  

I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need for forecasting margins
and invoicing three shippers at this time.  Before the change, I was able to run 1 report for each of these 
shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new report does not give me month-to-date totals 
I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time 
consuming to run and analyze all these  reports.  As Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume 
will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.

Other comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.




Thanks!

Attached is the CERA report entitled "Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply".

 
A short synopsis:

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling 
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices 
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by 
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the 
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.
 
*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the 
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day 
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop 
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive 
capacity.
 
*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy 
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

ENA is the agent on Eastern New Mexico's oba contract 25190.  The balance as of 11/30/01 is $47,610.18 due TW.

The contract does not have an associated nomination in December.  We are delivering approximately 500 mmbtus/day to
POI 13199 - the Eastern New Mexico Roosevelt point.  

Amy - please make contact(if you haven't yet) with Eastern New Mexico to see if they are going to be purchasing gas during December.  Also, make them aware that they are ultimately responsible for their oba balance.  ENA is still identified as the agent on this contract but .......?

In order to prevent this imbalance from growing, Eastern New Mexico needs to have someone schedule gas to their point.

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!
Kevin Hyatt x35559 & The Enron Kids Committee

	I spoke with Steve Kirk regarding this issue.  On May 3, 2001, the Reverse Auction shippers were notified that the Reverse Auction Pool POI  would be terminated November 1 and a revised Appendix A for the contracts setting forth the specific allocations of entitlement at Ventura, Welcome and Aberdeen points were provided to the shippers.  Therefore, the notice on the website would only need to remind shippers that the Reverse Auction Pool will terminate effective November 1, 2001.  We would recommend that the following notice be posted at anytime. 

	Reminder: The Reverse Auction Pool POI 60460 will be terminated November 1, 2001.

	Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.  Thanks MW

1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=

Do we wnat to single out the Keystone I/C, or should we be more generic and state that if/when any interconnecting party refuses to take gas due to nitrogen, we will restrict the offending receipts? Also, what about other areas such as the Hugoton. We have had complaints from Mid-American and Nicor about nitrogen sensitive customers on their systems complaining. sj

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	"The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows."

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

I know this is trivial, but, I don't believe we can actually settle on a .5 MMBtu and enter a fractional volume into GVA or TAS.   I would suggest using 8,625.

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the "direction" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		"If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties."

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
"We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s," said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. "Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather." 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
"This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather," said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

Just wanted to reinterate to everyone especially those that may not be here today, I have put on your monitors the procedures that we will use next Tuesday, December 11 regarding the collection of the money for the Reservation invoices. We will be giving you a list Tuesday morning that will show all of the shippers that we sent Reservation invoices to on December 3.  Do not call them until we get that list to you.  We would like for you to highlight the shippers that you have called and then return the lists to us.  This will help us to ensure that everyone has been called.

Please note:  If your shipper currently knows our Lock Box number because they send checks, please be sure that you call these folks because we cannot let them use the Lock Box.  They can still send a check in, but they will need to send it to the P.O. Box 1188 for this building.  If possible, give them your room location so that it can come directly to you.  If you have any questions, please let either of us know.

Thanks,

Larry and Raetta

Subject: Update VPN/IPASS (remote access)


Everyone - We are currently looking into what our (ETS) options are with iPASS/VPN.  As of right now, VPN should work just like before.  Shirley Walden, Mary Lou Phillips and Beverly Miller should be able to work from home starting tomorrow.  I will test the VPN connectivity from home tonight.  I did work from home last night without any issues. 
 
I am also working with the Solution Center to send out the new instructions to everyone for remote access via phone dialing, as we only have one number available now.  
 
As of today, everyone has rights for remote access/VPN.  Please stop all e-requests for iPASS/VPN access.  I have approval from Net Works to give a spreadsheet for access instead of an e-request for each user.   
 
For future requests, Donna and I are working on a easier way to give/get approval via e-requests.   We will communicate the new process soon.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or issues.  
 
Thanks.  Jean

Update:  This morning I visited with Laura Rupp to check on the status of this payment and she reported this was sent 12/21.  This afternoon I received a check from BP Canada in the amount of $5,443.08 which represents payment in full for these PPAs.  This should clear City of Duluth's A/R.

I cannot believe I am so excited about getting money I have no control over!

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

Lynn:

Per our phone conversation Saturday, November 17, 2001, this is to advise
that one of the North Team's customer. Reliant Energy Retail, Inc. (Nancy Callans
the Rep) was very, very,dissatisfied as well as questioning the integrity of TMS' 
Allocations for Gas Day 11/16/01.

Since John had discussed the details with me on Friday, November 16, 2001
(7:00 PM)  I will not reiterate them at this time unless we deem it necessary
to review the data at a later date.

Best regards,
Jean L. Blair

Lynn, I guess there were two handouts that I did not receive yesterday.  Would you e-mail me those so I could get those to the attendees?

Also, just out of curiosity, why did you decide to hold this meeting as our group is suppose to start holding brown bag meetings.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -  "The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have
approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said
the memo, adding that the information was "from a source of undetermined
reliability."

The FBI warning continued that "such an attack would allegedly take place in
the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either
captured or killed."

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email
list.  I will start working on the internal email list, but can you confirm we
can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the
attention.

Good job on these.  I think they will give Shelley comfort that a plan has been created.  We will discuss these with her at her 11:00 update meeting this morning and determine the next steps (Tuesday meeting, drill date etc).

Bob, Jean, Scott, and I drafted this up. They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide
the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what 
I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, 
ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. 
The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. 

Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will
be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the
documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored 
at the Hangar. 

There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the
first test. 

Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid 
confusion during such an event. 

Thanks, Gary

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a "handbook" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

I went back an revised our request to $100/employee.  Our rationale for setting a lower $50/employee number was to preserve PAA dollars if something new comes up.  Since the program is terminating, I thought I'd go for the full amount and HR approved.  We should have the checks by mid-week next week -- perhaps in time for the Gas Logistics Staff Meeting.

James,

As soon as we have a revised PPA invoice for October that we feel will be the final info, could you fax a copy to me.  The customer is waiting for some other data from me that uses SMS and DDVC amounts for the past year, and I cannot finish the info for him until we have this resolved.  I'd like to call him and give him an update.  Do you know approximately when we might have the revised PPA?

Thanks,

Joni

We will be traveling all day Wednesday, November 21 and Monday November 26th.  My pager should work

Otherwise you can reach me at 580-338-3929 (my sister in law Jan Goad) Wednesday night through Monday morning.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving and I'll see you on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,  I think it works best w/Ava & Alma having the responsibility to keep the list updated.  And no, Im not receiving the messages.  Alma deleted my name about a month ago.  I will have her add it to the list again.  Sheila

	Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name is on the list.
	Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the list
	and added the new people.  

	Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on
	this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?

	Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

I talked to Patricia this morning, and she and Marsha (Hollis) Shepherd are still working in EES for the next month or so.  With their extensive experience within the energy industry, please keep them in mind if anything becomes available within ETS.

Thanks,  Bert

WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 - "The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said the memo, adding that the information was "from a source of undetermined reliability."

The FBI warning continued that "such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed."

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

Crude Oil Futures Slide Despite OPEC Cut


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.49
to $20.41 per barrel on Friday, despite OPEC's official announcement
of a 1.5 million bpd cut in production after other producers agreed
to slice 462,500 bpd from their combined output. Crude oil prices
rose to $21.38 per barrel but then slumped after OPEC's president
said the cartel would be happy with anything above $20 per barrel for
Brent crude. However many doubt not only the cartels ability, but the
strength of commitment by non-members to stick to their lower
production quotas. The OPEC countries with quotas pumped 600,000 over
their limits in November. But Nigeria was responsible for half of the
cheating, producing 300,000 barrels over its quota. Nigeria's OPEC
representative is slated to become the cartel's new president on
January 1st, effectively putting pressure on the country to adhere to
its limits. Some positive news for the market was found as consumer
confidence posted its biggest gain in almost 4 years, home sales
climbed and unemployment rates stabilized. Heating oil futures for
January delivery on the NYMEX declined $0.0015 to $0.5665 per gallon.
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0071 to $0.5856 per
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on
the IPE were down $0.04 to $20.30 per barrel.

Refining Margins Forecast to Shrink in 2002

    Oil refiners around the world will likely experience shrinking
profit margins in 2002 as a global economic slump has sharply lowered
demand. The US, Asia and Northwest Europe all have a hefty oversupply
of oil inventories. Refinery runs can be expected to stay 10% - 50%
below capacity in Asia. Although the percentage may not be as quite
as dismal in Europe and the many still expect lower refinery profits
for early 2002 and possibly for most of the year on both continents.
Asia's margins were mostly negative this year while US margins hit $6-
$9 per barrel early in 2001 but fell to $3 - $4 per barrel later in
the year. European margins were mostly unchanged at an average of
about $2.00 per barrel. In Northwest Europe, refiners' profits depend
on how US gasoline prices fare, as a large portion of Europe's
surplus gasoline is exported across the Atlantic. Northwest European
refiners have cut up to 20% of runs in the last month. On average for
2001, margins for Northwest Europe refineries running Brent crude are
estimated to be less than $2.00 per barrel, below the $3.00 average
for 2000, but well above the $1.20 per barrel Northwest European
margins of 1999.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector

    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in
the weather. In the category of energy stocks, oilfield services can
be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and
downs of drilling activity. When companies lower their drilling
activity, equipment and service companies do not get hired but still
have many fixed costs. The upstream oil and natural gas exploration
and production business is the next most volatile sector of the
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55%
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year.
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards
more volatile energy stocks.

Judge Recuses Himself in Unocal Patent Case

Unocal has said that a US District Court Judge recused himself from
the case involving infringement on the its '393 gasoline patent due
to his discovery that he had a financial interest in one of the
parties involved. The case will be returned for reassignment. In
October, the judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment
requesting an accounting of infringement of its '393 cleaner burning
gasoline patent by 5 refiners. However, a written judgment had not
been issued. Further proceedings in the case will now be considered
by the new judge. The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield,
Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Shell. In 1997, a jury found the
Unocal patent valid and that the defendants had infringed upon it in
their refining processes. The jury awarded damages of $0.0575 per
infringing gallon. Unocal received a payment of $69 million plus
accrued interest and some attorneys' fees in June 2000 for
infringement from March through July, 1996. About 29% of the RFG
gasoline manufactured by the defendants during that period infringed
on the '393 patent. The jury decision was upheld by an Appeals Court
in May 2000. In February of 2001, the Supreme Court declined to hear
the case. License agreements have been signed with 8 companies for
the 5 patents that Unocal holds for cleaner burning gasoline
compositions. Earlier this year, Unocal introduced a uniform
licensing program that specifies a range of between $0.12 and $0.34
per gallon for volumes that fall under the Unocal patents. The rate
per gallon is reduced as more utilization occurs.

ExxonMobil May Withdraw Bid for China Pipeline Project

    ExxonMobil is considering pulling out of talks to build a $5 
billion natural gas pipeline in China. The withdrawal would leave
Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the only major foreign oil company taking
part in the project and may affect its funding. The 4,000-kilometer
pipeline, China's longest, is part of a $14 billion plan to transport
reserves in the northwestern province of Xinjiang to Shanghai.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector

    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in

be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and

and production business is the next most volatile sector of the
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55%
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year.
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards
more volatile energy stocks.

I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email
list.  I will start working on the internal email list, but can you confirm we
can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the

Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should
try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what
that address is and we'll get you set up.

Thanks!

Vernon:
We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if
you could

couple

be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that
would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Frank, 

Accounting has indicated our October invoice has some DDVC and IT overrun charges that our metering does not show.  Before we can pay these, we would need you to verify the measurement of all of our stations.  Bill and his SCADA folks believe the untelemetered allocations are inaccurate, and likely causing the DDVC and overrun.  

I have asked our Accounting group to short pay the October DDVC's of $26,374; and to also short pay the associated transport invoice for the IT overrun of $29,704.52; a total disputed cost of $56.078.52.  

Let me know if you need any additional information, a brief recap of the disputed charges are shown below, 

Thanks, 

Tom

Attached is an update of the packets that will end November, 2001.  Most of them require adjustments for rounding.  Please remind your shippers that any balances left in a packet will be cleared through their Park & Ride agreement, and they will incur a carry-over charge.

Thanks for your help.  Call if you have any questions.

Attached is a list of all packets ending October 2001.  Most need adjustments because of rounding, however, there are some that need additional adjustments before month end.   Any balance left at the end of the month will be transferred to their Park & Ride contract.  

These are the shippers that need special attention:

Aquila	#108027 and #108028
ENA	#106875 and #107822
NSP	#107664 (needs to up their injection to 4,331/day to be at zero at month end)
Occidental	#106850
Reliant	#107030
Tenaska #107947

Thanks for your help.

US Physical Gas Prices End Up; Still $1 Below Nymex

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly rose Monday, but held as much as a full $1 per million British thermal units below the New York Mercantile Exchange's December futures contract, traders said. 
Pushing prices upward is a mix of next-month's futures values and the impatience of waiting for winter, traders said. 
Traders covered short positions and balanced out pipeline overruns in usual end-of-month trading. Clouding the procedures were concerns about Enron Corp.'s viability and about terrorism attacks on pipelines, as Attorney General John Ashcroft confirmed warnings received by the FBI and other security agencies. 
Traders don't expect the cash-to-futures spread to continue much longer, especially with the advent of winter weather and the expiration of the December contract on Wednesday. 
However, major constrictions were reported over the weekend and Monday at major Gulf Coast to Northeast pipelines, meaning storage is full and there's little incentive to hedge. 
"People have no place to go (with the gas)," said one trader. 
In the West, prices strengthened as traders looked ahead to next-month values, one trader said. 
"There was absolutely no reason to be buying," said one Gulf Coast trader. He saw some weather forecasts predicting cooler temperatures, but those predictions were still above-normal weather patterns. 
"Winter will be here sometime," he said. 
Traders also avoided doing physical gas deals with Enron Corp., whose merger with Dynegy Inc. appeared in danger. Enron faces employee lawsuits and a weakening of its bonds. The company is reportedly trying to renegotiate its deal with Dynegy. In the meantime, a trader said Enron's gas bids and offers were well above pricing seen on other boards. 
December goes off the board Wednesday. It settled at $2.696 per million British thermal units, down 11.7 cents. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $1.72-$1.90/MMBtu, up 10 cents on the bid, down 39 cents on the offer. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.72-$1.88/MMBtu range, unchanged on the bid, down 22 cents on the offer from Wednesday's range. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California lines, buyers paid $2.03-$2.50/MMBtu, up 55 cents-78 cents. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $1.78-$2.05/MMBtu, up 11 cents-16 cents. November index is $3.01/MMBtu. Houston Ship Channel rose 13 cents-15 cents to $1.84-$2.09/MMBtu. Index is $3.12/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.88-$2.20/MMBtu, up 33 cents-47 cents. November index is $2.86/MMBtu.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
"People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage," said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
"At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued," said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms," said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
"Escape clauses" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness," he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place," Heim said. "Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "completely indefensible," he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
"I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up," said one trader. "Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive." 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
"The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk," wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. "While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions." 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
"The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios," said CreditSights. 
"The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans," wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. "If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies." 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron." 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he said. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility." 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not," he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays," O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
"There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested," a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
"We have not received any official communication from them," the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)
2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



Enron Shares Slides to All-Time Low

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals," A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to "growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely."

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is "not very favorable" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay "afloat" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but "the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal."

Heim has a "sell" rating on the stock.



FBI warns energy companies of possible threat to gas pipelines by Osama bin Laden's network
By H. JOSEF HEBERT

11/26/2001 
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI has warned energy companies that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack North American natural gas pipelines and facilities if he is captured or killed. 
Natural gas producers and pipeline companies continued to be on a high state of alert, industry executives said Monday, although they declined to discuss the latest warning, which was sent in a memo to industry security officials last week. 
In Bismarck, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline officials put employees on notice that they need to implement security measures, spokeswoman Laura Lueder said. 
The company, a subsidiary of MDU Resources, serves North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. 
"The company always had security measures outlined for these kind of situations, but it did update the measures following the Sept. 11 attacks," Lueder said. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft confirmed the FBI warning, though he expressed some doubt that attacks would be conditioned on bin Laden's capture or death. 
"It didn't take anything specific to trigger the attacks on the World Trade Center or the Pentagon," said Ashcroft when asked about the alert at a news conference. Even so, "those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously." 
The alert did not single out a specific target, but referred to natural gas supplies including the more than 260,000 miles of gas pipelines and hundreds of pumping stations and other facilities. 
"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said the memo, according to several industry sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"Such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed," the alert continued. 
The FBI alert said the information came "from a source of undetermined reliability" and that "no additional details on how such an attack would be carried out, or which facilities would be targeted" could be learned. 
Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the energy industries - including operators of nuclear power plants, refineries, pipelines and power grids - have scrambled to increase security on a belief that they could be singled out for another round of attacks. 
One industry source characterized the FBI warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts. In that case, no further evidence of potential terrorist activity emerged. 
The alert was sent on Nov. 17 from FBI headquarters to agency field offices, which then forwarded the information to industry officials. The alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a memo last Wednesday to oil and gas companies. 
Energy industry executives were reluctant to discuss the latest alert, or their security measures, although several confirmed the memo and said additional precautions have been taken. Still, the potential for a terrorist attack has left some industry officials jittery. 
"We prefer to keep a low profile," said an official of one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies, agreeing to speak only on background so that the company would not publicly be singled out. 
"Our facilities are on high alert and they have been since Sept. 11," said Laurie Cramer, a spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association, which represents natural gas producers. 
There are 263,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines crossing the country and another million miles of local distribution lines. Although most of the lines are buried, aerial surveillance of major pipelines has been increased and security tightened at pumping stations, industry officials said. 
Access to facilities has been restricted as well, officials said. Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. 
But the industry is in a quandary over how much information should be withheld about the location of pipelines, which often must be clearly marked to prevent someone from accidentally rupturing one when digging. The availability of maps also has helped to promote acceptance of pipelines in communities. 
"We want people to know where they are" to prevent accidents, said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. But he acknowledged the desire for public disclosure now is being tempered somewhat for security concerns. 
"The biggest danger to natural gas pipelines on an ongoing basis is (the line) being hit by a backhoe or heavy equipment," said Kelly Merritt, a spokesman for Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., one of the country's biggest pipeline companies. 
While a rupture of a gas or oil pipeline could cause significant problems, industry experts emphasized that most lines are relatively isolated and even a major break in a line can normally be repaired fairly quickly. 



Heads Urge Pipe Safety Passage.

Natural Gas Week 
P8

WASHINGTON, D.C. - A letter to US Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta urged passage of an effective and responsible pipeline safety bill. 
In the letter, released last week, pipeline leaders offered their assistance to the department and said, "Our industries have joined together to address both regulatory and legislative pipeline safety issues in a unified fashion." 
Signing the letter were 14 leaders of the oil and natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline industries and the leaders of the five key trade associations, which include the American Gas Association, American Petroleum Institute, Association of Oil Pipe Lines, American Public Gas Association and Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
The letter came with the industry's unified position paper calling for regulatory and legislative action on pipeline safety. The industry is urging an adequately staffed and funded Office of Pipeline Safety and other measures to increase safety and enhance public confidence. 


Enron and Dynegy
Discuss Plan to Cut
Price of Acquisition
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel

11/27/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A3 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Enron Corp., struggling to save its two-week-old deal to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., was in advanced discussions with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Beleaguered Enron also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis, these people said. Enron has total debt of about $13 billion. Increasingly, analysts are worried that the giant energy-trading concern's relatively few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can't be used to support further borrowing. 
Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the past few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a process that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress. 
The move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement, and particularly to slash the number of Dynegy shares that Enron holders would receive, only two weeks after the pact's signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions. While terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments, that typically doesn't happen until a transaction is nearly completed. 
Enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement yesterday that would calm its anxious investors, but the situation remained fluid throughout the day. As of yesterday evening, the revised deal still hadn't been formalized. 
The deal is critical for Enron. In recent weeks, credit-rating agencies have indicated they will refrain from further cuts to Enron's credit rating so long as a Dynegy purchase appears probable. But if that deal collapses, downgrades could occur that would put Enron below investment grade and in violation of credit agreements with counterparties. This in turn could deal a savage blow to Enron's commodity-trading business that is its lifeblood. 
Negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of Houston yesterday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban New York where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal, which was announced Nov. 9. Both Dynegy and Enron declined to comment on the discussions. 
One apparent sticking point in the talks was arriving at a new stock-exchange ratio. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. Based on yesterday's New York Stock Exchange closing price of $39.25 for Dynegy shares, down $1.15, Enron holders stand to receive $10.53 a share for their stock, or a total of about $9 billion. 
People close to the discussions said the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than $6 a share, or about $5 billion. 
Another contentious issue concerns the amount of additional capital Enron needs to shore up its finances. A week ago, the company disclosed it may have to post hundreds of millions of dollars or more to honor collateral calls before the end of the year. The problem for potential lenders is finding good assets to back these continued infusions of capital sought by Enron. 
As part of the original merger agreement, Dynegy already has injected $1.5 billion into Enron, receiving in exchange preferred stock in its Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline system that runs from the upper Midwest to Texas. Under the agreement, if the acquisition falls apart, Dynegy "will have the right to acquire 100% of the equity in the Northern Natural Gas subsidiary," thus giving it "the full value of its investment." 
But that arrangement is raising questions on Wall Street about whether creditors are throwing good money after bad. Northern Natural Gas already is heavily encumbered with debts. In addition to $500 million in unsecured public debt and $1.5 billion put in by Dynegy and co-investor ChevronTexaco Inc., a bank consortium led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. recently put in an additional $450 million in cash backed by Northern's assets. The bank consortium also provided $550 million to Enron, against which assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. unit were pledged. This system, a network between Texas and California, is the only other domestic gas-transportation system fully owned by Enron. 
That brings total indebtedness to nearly $4 billion for two Enron pipeline systems that only generated transportation revenue of $77 million and $41 million, respectively, in the third quarter. Enron's entire natural-gas pipeline business, which includes two other partially owned systems, produced pretax earnings of $85 million for the third quarter, flat with the year-earlier period. Some observers said that if the Enron deal to be acquired by Dynegy falls apart, this could set the stage for a fight among the different classes of creditors for a priority claim on the pipeline assets.

Hedging for the `Upper Tier'
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis

In the 1990s, as the stock market climbed year after year, many corporations and their employees entered into a marriage of convenience: The company would dole out its own shares as compensation and benefits. Employees would have a steadily appreciating asset that encouraged loyalty and created an incentive to work hard for the company's success. 
They're still doing it. Gillette Co., for example, "believes it is important that employee interests be aligned with company interests," says spokesman Stephen K. Brayton, echoing the explanations of dozens of other companies that use their own stock for executive pay, incentive bonuses, or contributions to 401(k) retirement-savings accounts. 
But as share prices have fallen over the past year and a half, it has become clear that not all stock handouts are created equal. Millions of rank-and-file workers at hundreds of companies have found themselves shackled to big chunks of company stock, while executives are able to exercise wide latitude in what they do with theirs. Because of the law capping tax-deductible executive compensation at $1 million a year, many companies top off their executive pay packages with stock options, as well as bonuses and other incentives that are typically paid in stock, much of it unencumbered. 
Based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, hundreds of companies use their own stock in lieu of cash as their matching contributions to employees' retirement-savings accounts. And the majority of those restrict the ability of employees to sell the shares and move the proceeds into mutual funds and other alternatives offered through their 401(k)s. Benefits consultants Hewitt Associates found in a recent study that nearly half of 215 firms offering company stock in their 401(k) plans only contribute their own shares to employee accounts, and that 85% of those companies restrict sales of the stock. 
Gillette doesn't let employees switch out of its stock contributions to their 401(k)s until age 50, according to government filings. At Coca-Cola Co., it's age 53. Procter & Gamble Co., Qwest Communications International Inc. and troubled Enron Corp. -- now facing lawsuits over employees' 401(k) losses -- are among the many others that impose similar restrictions. So far this year, Gillette employees have had to watch the company-contribution portion of their retirement savings shrink by millions of dollars as the share price has fallen 11%. Employees at Coca-Cola have endured a share-price decline this year of 18%. Procter & Gamble shares have been flat. 
The companies point out that executives participate in the same 401(k) plans as other employees, subject to the same restrictions. Still, the bulk of company stock that executives own is usually held outside such restricted accounts. 
At Qwest, with a share price down 69% so far this year, top executives and directors have sold a combined $172 million of Qwest shares so far this year, according to SEC data collected by Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. Qwest Chief Executive Joseph P. Nacchio alone has sold Qwest shares valued at $89 million. 
Likewise, many companies offer supplemental savings plans for executives that don't force them to hold company stock. Some top executives at Coca-Cola can participate in a supplemental retirement-savings plan with a guaranteed annual return of 14%. Executives at Qwest are able to contribute as much as 100% of their salaries and bonuses to a supplemental plan in which they can allocate their own and company contributions as they like. 
Executives also can protect themselves -- without selling their shares and triggering taxes -- by using hedging techniques offered for just that purpose by firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Eaton Vance Corp. and Bessemer Trust Co. Disclosure of these deals to the SEC is generally required but spotty. 
"It clearly has been a growing business, and very busy in the last 12 months," says Michael Dweck, head of the Single Stock Risk Management division at Goldman Sachs. (The firms marketing these hedging strategies typically hedge their own side of the transactions to protect themselves, as well.) "People recognize the inherent risk of holding all your wealth in a single stock." His operation generally won't arrange transactions for blocks of stock worth less than $5 million. "It's for the upper tier of management," Mr. Dweck says. 
For the rest, companies point out, employees have ample opportunity to diversify their retirement-savings portfolios by investing their own contributions in other options offered. Indeed, many workers have ill-advisedly put a lot of their own 401(k) money into their employers' stock. 
Wyn Triska, a 42-year-old power-plant technician for an Enron unit in Estacada, Ore., says he warned many of his co-workers of the dangers of wagering all their retirement savings on Enron. "Even when Enron was going up," he says, "I never put a cent into it -- it just doesn't make sense to load up on one stock." Nonetheless, even he has been unable to sell the stock that Enron has contributed to his 401(k) as the share price has plummeted from $86 a little more than a year ago to around $4 now. Under the company's 401(k) rules, he can't sell until age 50. 
For many rank-and-file workers, risk-averse or not, their 401(k)s are their largest assets, apart from their homes. So holding company stock they can't sell has become a source of resentment and frustration. Federal pension law leaves 401(k) plans largely outside the realm of regulation. But lately, some employees have taken their frustration to the courts. 
Just this month, in three separate lawsuits -- the latest filed yesterday -- participants in Enron's 401(k) plan allege that Enron misled them about the risks of investing in the company's shares. The suits, all filed in Federal District Court in Houston, note that the company "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes. That prevented all employees, regardless of age, from selling any Enron shares in their 401(k)s as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. Enron says it doesn't comment on pending litigation. 
Those lawsuits, along with a handful filed against other companies recently, don't take on directly the practice of forcing employees to accept and hold company stock in their 401(k)s. That's perfectly legal. So whatever the outcome, a company would still be able to restrict employee sales of company-stock contributions to 401(k) before the price declines. "Even when they've had gains, they can't really lock them in because they can't diversify," says Randall Shoker, an Oxford, Ohio, financial adviser. 
Michael Green knows that. The 35-year-old investment specialist joined Dell Computer Corp. in 1995 as a product manager. He and his wife, Lisa, an assistant controller at the company, were thrilled as the stock rose to about $51 a share in late 1999 from $1 in mid-1995, adjusted for splits. 
But by the late '90s, the couple felt overexposed to Dell. In addition to the Dell stock that the company had contributed to their 401(k) plans, they had received stock options as bonuses. And they had bought a home in Austin, Texas, where the real-estate market is tied in part to the fortunes of Dell, one of the area's biggest employers. 
The Greens sold some of the stock they received as bonuses. But Dell wouldn't let employees sell shares the company contributed to their retirement accounts until they had been at the company for five years. "I tried so hard to sell," Mr. Green says. "We went around and around." 
The company changed its policy last year to allow all Dell employees to sell the shares in their 401(k) plan and shift the proceeds into alternatives available through the plan. By then, though, Dell shares had plummeted, erasing $200,000 from the Greens' 401(k) accounts. "That's as much as we paid for our house," Mr. Green says. Both left Dell earlier this year for other jobs. 
SEC filings show that Dell executives, though subject to the same restrictions on their regular 401(k) accounts, can participate in a supplementary retirement-savings plan that allows them immediately to reinvest the company's contribution in a variety of options. Executives have seized that opportunity: Just 9% of the supplementary retirement plan was invested in Dell stock at the end of last year, according to the company's latest 11K filing, compared with about 50% of Dell's 401(k) plan. 
Dell spokesman T.R. Reid declines to comment on the Greens' circumstances. He says that any employees who lose so much money on company contributions could do so only because they had made a bundle until that point. And providing Dell shares to the employee retirement-savings plan, he says, "certainly provides incentive to not only think but act like a shareholder." 
The company ended the five-year lock-down rule, Mr. Reid says, because it was no longer necessary to keep employees focused on improving Dell's shareholder value. And he says Dell executives don't have to hold company stock in their supplementary plan because they "receive a significant portion of their compensation in Dell stock," and thus they already "have the broader interests of the company and shareholders squarely in their sights." 
SEC filings show that Dell executives nonetheless have means to protect themselves from exposure to the company's stock. Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the computer company he founded, transferred a total of 4.1 million shares, worth $190.7 million, into so-called exchange funds in several transactions between September 1999 and May 2000. (The shares accounted for about 1.3% of Mr. Dell's total company holdings at the time). 
Offered by financial firms to the wealthy, exchange funds are, in essence, mutual funds that allow holders of large chunks of a single stock to pool their assets, giving them a stake in a diversified, less-risky basket of securities and, in some cases, postponing tax liabilities. Altogether, the value of Mr. Dell's hedged shares would have fallen in market value by 38%, or $73 million, by earlier this month had he taken no precautions. (The return on the diversified exchange fund isn't disclosed). 
Until the five-year rule was lifted, employees like Mr. Green could get out of their Dell 401(k) holdings only by withdrawing money from their accounts, paying income tax and a 10% penalty on the withdrawal, and then reinvesting the difference. 
Or, says Dell spokesman Mike Maher, they could have elected "to take their compensation and not put it in their 401(k), and invest it in some other stock." By doing so, however, they would have forgone the company's matching contribution altogether. Mr. Maher declines to comment on Mr. Dell's transactions. He notes that like executives, regular employees who receive options are free to sell their shares. "We're all playing by the same rules," he says. 
The hedging maneuvers executives can employ to protect their company holdings fall largely off the radar screens of regulators and shareholders. While the SEC generally requires that key executives report these transactions, experts say the rules are largely ignored. "We really are only able to uncover several a month at most, which leads me to believe that the insiders are not filing these as often as they should," says Lon Gerber, director of research at Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, which combs SEC filings to track insider trading trends. 
Mr. Dweck, head of the Goldman Sachs division that manages single-stock investments for wealthy investors, says his group's clients disclose their transactions when required. And Qwest Chairman Philip Anschutz recently disclosed that last May, he entered into a "forward-sale agreement" with a brokerage firm, locking in as many as 10 million Qwest shares at close to their then-current price. Qwest's share price has since fallen 68%; the value of Mr. Anschutz's shares covered in the agreement would have plunged to $127 million from $394 million. (Those shares amounted to about 3.3% of Mr. Anschutz's total holding of 300 million shares, or 18% of Qwest's shares outstanding, both directly and through a company he controls.) 
A forward-sale agreement wasn't available to Joseph Daugherty. He has been stringing and repairing telephone cable for 23 years, first for Bell South Corp. and then in the Salt Lake City area for U S West, which was acquired by Qwest last year. 
A few months ago, he was looking forward to early retirement next summer. But now, he says, he'll have to keep working. The $200,000 in assets he had in his 401(k) in early May has shrunk to roughly $50,000. Part of that loss is attributable to the retirement plan's rules, which don't allow most workers to shift out of company-contributed Qwest shares until age 55. Mr. Daugherty, who concedes he's a risk-taker, blames himself for the rest: He voluntarily sank the remainder of his 401(k) savings into Qwest stock. 
Qwest won't comment on the finances of either Mr. Daugherty or Mr. Anschutz. But Steve Hammack, a Qwest spokesman, says U S West established the policy of contributing company stock. He notes that starting Jan. 1, 2001, the company began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they receive this year into other investments available through the plan. The restrictions on union members, he says, are covered by the company's collective bargaining agreement. 
"The fact is," Mr. Hammack responds in an email, "the majority of companies in the U.S. that match employee contributions do so in their own company stock. A good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the company match." 
Erisa, the federal law governing pension plans, provides employees with little legal traction to complain about their forced 401(k) holdings. Employer contributions to retirement-savings plans aren't generally subject to fiduciary rules. (As for employee contributions, employers are supposed to choose "prudent" investment options.) 
Retirement-savings plans are exempt from Erisa diversification rules, too. These rules make it illegal for a company's pension plan to invest more than 10% of its assets in the company's own securities. But savings plans such as 401(k)s can generally invest as much as 100% of the assets in company stock with impunity. Currently, roughly one-third to one-half of retirement-plan assets at large companies are invested in company stock. That suits employers, which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash, and in the past, they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose diversification rules on 401(k)s. 
That confounds people such as Mr. Triska, the technician at Enron's Portland General Electric unit. "Anyone will tell you that you need to diversify to reduce risk," he says. 
Diversification has spared Mr. Triska some of the pain experienced by co-workers who bet big on Enron in their retirement savings. Since Sept. 10, while the Enron shares in his 401(k) have plunged 86%, his shares in Weitz Partners Value Fund have declined only 4.52%, and his shares in Fidelity Growth Company and Janus Global Life Sciences funds have risen 7.3% and 2.2%, respectively. 
Enron executives are subject to the same restrictions on Enron's stock contributions to their 401(k)s as other employees: no sales of company-contributed stock until age 50. But company filings with the SEC show that "key management and highly compensated employees" also participate in separate retirement-savings plans that don't require them to hold Enron stock at all. Executives can pile as much as 35% of their salaries and 100% of their bonuses annually into these accounts, allocating the money among a variety of investments. 
Further, SEC filings show that so far this year, many Enron executives were steady sellers of company stock they had accumulated beyond the ambit of their 401(k)s. Former Enron Broadband Services Chief Executive Kenneth Rice, for example, sold Enron shares valued at $23.7 million during the period, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling sold $27.5 million of Enron stock. 
"We believe it's important for employees to have a stake in the company," says Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's also important that we align employee and company performance."

Enron shares off 15% on doubts about deal Dynegy's $9-billion buyout offer might not be completed under original terms

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. shares fell another 15 per cent yesterday, and briefly traded below their all-time low, as investors continued to doubt that a $9-billion (U.S.) buyout offer from rival Dynegy Inc. would be completed under the current terms. 
Enron's stock slide, coupled with traders shying away from Enron's core energy trading business that Dynegy wants most, raises the question of whether the energy giant can maintain enough assets to keep Dynegy interested, said Mike Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
"I think Dynegy's really got Enron's back against the wall and at a minimum, I think restructuring is possible," Mr. Heim said. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa reiterated yesterday that the company is moving forward with the acquisition of its larger, troubled rival and "we are continuing to conduct our confirmatory due diligence." 
Enron stock fell as low as $3.76 before rebounding somewhat to close at $4.01, down 70 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. That's 60 per cent below the current value of Dynegy's offer of $10.54 a share based on Dynegy's close of $39.25, down $1.15 for the day. 
Enron's all-time trading low was a split-adjusted $3.94 on Oct. 27, 1987, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. 
Enron shares have plunged more than 95 per cent from their February 52-week high of $84.87, as the company's complicated finances began to unravel and raised concerns about its financial viability. 
The merger agreement between the two Houston-based companies contains an escape clause that would allow Dynegy to back out if Enron suffers serious loss in business or assets. 
Mr. Heim said Dynegy has a good argument to trigger that clause, given Enron's predictions of fourth-quarter losses and erosion of traders. 
But Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright said that while a renegotiation is reasonable, it is doubtful Dynegy will abandon the deal. 



Battered Enron in Search of $1 Billion; Stock's Decline Raises Doubts About Buyout

Shunned by investors and deserted by many former customers, Enron Corp. is searching this week for up to $1 billion in cash from lenders to sustain its once dominant energy-trading business. 
Enron stock fell yesterday to new low of $4.01 a share, down 70 cents, continuing the latest plunge that began last week when the Houston company disclosed still more damaging detail about its financial condition. 
A year ago, Enron stock traded for more than $78 a share, based on its leading position then as a trader of power, natural gas, various industrial and telecommunications products and financial contracts linked to these commodities. 
Dynegy Inc., Enron's Houston rival, said yesterday it was not moving away from its $23 billion cash and debt offer to buy Enron. Enron declined to comment on its financial problems. 
But Enron's stock has dropped more than 50 percent since the Dynegy deal was announced Nov. 9. Investors believe that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal at a cheaper price or even try to abandon it, said Brian Youngberg, a financial analyst with Edward D. Jones & Co. in St. Louis. 
"The [Dynegy] deal values Enron at more than $10 a share. For a company that's trading at $4, that doesn't make much sense," said Youngberg, who last week recommended that customers sell Enron shares. 
As part of the Dynegy deal, Enron received $1.5 billion in cash, secured by stock in one of its pipelines. But without another large infusion of cash, the company faces what Youngberg called a "death spiral." 
Along with investors, many energy buyers and traders have lost confidence in Enron's ability to make good on the long-term energy contracts it specializes in, Youngberg said. Enron's most important operations involve contracts to deliver natural gas, electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities in the future. It also sells financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices. 
These deals are the one part of Enron that Dynegy wants. 
"Their core business has dropped off sharply," said Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York. Enron remains a sizable player in the huge daily trading of energy products, but is being frozen out of long-term markets and relegated to less profitable short-term trades, said Meade. 
The lengthy span of Enron's crisis, which began a month ago when it reported a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, has given companies time to close out contracts with Enron or limit their potential losses if Enron were to fail, said Louis B. Gagliardi, an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. in Connecticut. 
"If Enron went to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or failed, it would unsettle the market slightly. But it wouldn't catch people by surprise. So there's not much danger of a crisis on the natural gas or power side" of energy trading, Gagliardi said. Other market participants cautioned that the extent of Enron's obligations to trading partners is not known to outsiders, making the impact of an Enron failure hard to assess. 
Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco Corp., could pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase went through, but under the best of circumstances, regulatory review of the deal will drag on for another six months. Investors and traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang around that long by itself, "That just adds to the uncertainty about the stock," Gagliardi said. 
Dynegy's offer for Enron caused a brief rally in Enron's stock price and outlook. 
But that flurry of optimism was halted by a new financial report last week to the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing even more serious debt obligations than the company had previously acknowledged. 
Enron was able to negotiate a three-week extension on a $690 million note that was coming due this week and finished arrangements on a $450 million line of credit, part of a $1 billion infusion it had previously announced. 
However, the $690 million obligation, disclosed in the SEC filing, was a very pointed alert to investors about Enron's growing cash needs, Meade said. 
And the new details of Enron's plight in last week's filing further damaged the credibility of the company's financial reporting, Meade said. 
"I don't think they have fully restated their earnings. There is probably more to come, Meade said." 
Enron's board has turned to an outside committee to assess the company's financial condition, after acknowledging last month that Enron had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 
The restatement was caused primarily by accounting decisions that concealed losses in a series of limited partnerships that Enron had helped create to buy various energy, water supply and Internet network properties it wanted to dispose of, the company said. 
On Nov. 14, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, briefed analysts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash, including the current quest for $500 million to $1 billion in loans. Enron, its executives said, will reorganize the company around its business that generated the strongest cash flow -- energy trades, gas pipeline and coal operations. Other assets, worth $8 billion in book value, would be put up for sale "in an orderly fashion." 
Then came the new disclosures last week, reinforcing analysts' concerns that the depths of Enron's liabilities have not yet been plumbed. 
"The issues that brought Enron to this point are unresolved. It's a balance sheet that doesn't stand still and continues to deteriorate," Gagliardi said.

INDIA: Enron India unit, lenders to meet in UK this week.

11/27/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
BOMBAY, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Enron Corp's troubled Indian unit and its foreign lenders will hold separate meetings this week to decide the fate of a power project once considered the showpiece of India's reform programme, a banking source said on Tuesday. 
The meetings, to be held in London on Friday and Saturday, will consider proposals to allow the Dabhol Power Company, which is 65 percent owned by Enron, to pull the plug on a contract to sell power from a giant power project, he said. 
The $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, has been shut since June this year following a dispute with its sole buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The departure of Enron and its partners would be another blow to attempts to attract foreign investment into the domestic power sector. 
Five foreign companies have either pulled out or announced plans to exit the sector, fed up with bureaucratic delays and legal wrangling over the past few years. 
At the same time, parent Enron Corp of the United States is struggling to ward off bankruptcy and save its proposed buyout by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. 
Its share price has already taken a beating this year over widespread investor doubts about its corporate governance practices. Enron shares closed down 73 cents, or 15.4 percent, at $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday, after dipping to at least an 18-year-low of $3.76. 
A Dabhol spokesman in Bombay confirmed that the Dabhol board is meeting in November 30 in London. But he declined to disclose the agenda. 
The banking source said the Dabhol board will consider giving the management authorisation to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB. 
Foreign lenders, led by Citibank and Bank of America, are meeting in London on the same day and will also consider giving Dabhol permission to issue such a notice. 
Under a 1995 agreement between Dabhol and MSEB in 1995, the company needs lenders' permission before issuing a terminating notice. 
Once issued, the notice would trigger international arbitration to resolve arguments over damages. 
MEGA PROJECT 
Dabhol and MSEB have been feuding for more than a year over payment defaults and high tariffs. The dispute stopped work on the second phase of the unit which is 97 percent complete. 
Enron and its fellow U.S. investors General Electric Co and Bechtel, fed up with payment defaults, have already announced their intentions to exit the project. 
They have agreed to sell their stake of 85 percent to either the Indian government or a private power company. At the same time, they have also proceeded with plans to cancel the contract. 
A preliminary cancellation notice was issued in May this year. This was to be followed up by a final termination notice after six months. That six-month deadline expired on November 19. 
But Dabhol was prevented from taking the final step by a Bombay court. Acting on an urgent petition by Indian lenders, who were against the termination, the court asked Dabhol not to issue such a notice until December 3. 
The banking source said Dabhol is only trying to secure all approvals and would not actually issue the notice on November 30. 



Enron Talking With Dynegy As They Work To Rescue Deal

c. 2001 New York Times Company 
The Enron Corporation and its would-be rescuer, Dynegy Inc., are renegotiating the terms of their deal, originally valued at $9 billion, executives close to the discussions said yesterday. 
There were several issues still on the table last night, and the situation was very fluid, the executives said. But they said that the companies hoped to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; an agreement by some banks to extend the repayment dates of Enron debt until after the deal closes; and possibly an agreement making clear that the merger would not be derailed by litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. 
The sides were also negotiating ways to tighten clauses in the merger agreement so that Dynegy would not be able to use information from Enron's recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a reason for backing out of the deal. 
Both companies declined to comment on whether renegotiations were taking place. 
But according to executives close to the talks, the new terms would lower the ratio of Dynegy stock to be exchanged to roughly 0.15 share for each share of Enron. The original deal, announced Nov. 9, called for each Enron share to be exchanged for 0.2685 share of Dynegy. But Enron's shares have been plunging steadily, and yesterday the current offer was valued at 163 percent over Enron's closing price. 
The companies hope that by releasing some good news, they can stem the slide in the price of Enron's stock and traded debt. Enron shares, which have been plunging since mid-October when the company began to disclose a series of losses and accounting errors, closed yesterday at $4.01, down 14.9 percent, or 70 cents. Shares of Dynegy closed at $39.25 yesterday, down 2.9 percent, or $1.15. 
More important, the executives close to the talks said, the companies hope to restore confidence in Enron's energy-trading operation, which showed signs of deterioration yesterday. In recent years, Enron has traded more natural gas and electricity than its two biggest competitors combined, and its trading floor is viewed as its most valuable franchise, accounting for most of the company's profit. 
Dynegy's biggest worry, according to the executives, is that this core business is deteriorating. The company fears that if other energy traders further curtail their business with Enron -- either on their own or in response to another cut in Enron's credit rating -- then much of the value of the company could be wiped out, they said. 
The urgency of the situation has been made clear by the way in which Enron is being treated in the energy-trading markets, some analysts and executives at rival energy companies say. Though some large traders are still doing business with Enron, many other traders have curtailed their dealings with the company for fear they may not get paid if Enron collapses and files for bankruptcy protection. 
In addition, some of the energy trading Enron is doing is costing it more money because of credit concerns. For example, analysts and energy executives say, Enron is in some cases being forced to pay 3 cents to 6 cents more per million British thermal units of natural gas. That means instead of paying perhaps $1.80 per million B.T.U.'s in some trades, it may be paying $1.84. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company in Houston, said the price discrepancies on some trades were also showing up on EnronOnline, the Internet platform that accounts for much of the company's trading with other parties. 
''We're seeing Enron's prices,'' Mr. Dietert said, ''be about a nickel higher on EnronOnline versus some of the competing Internet-based exchanges.'' If these credit premiums should continue, it could erode Enron's trading profits and worsen its already tenuous liquidity situation. 
An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said trading volumes were ''below average,'' yesterday, but she declined to be more specific. She did say the company was in discussions about a new equity infusion of $500 million to $1 billion. 
According to executives close to the talks, details were still being worked out on the cash infusion, which would come from Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase. Dynegy may also add cash to the deal while reaffirming the company's commitment to the merger. 
Executives at rival trading companies said Dynegy needed to do something to bolster confidence in Enron's trading operations. 
''In places, Enron is paying up to 4 or 5 or 6 cents more for next-day gas,'' said an executive at one large energy trader. ''Some producers out there don't want to sell additional discretionary gas to Enron, so they're having to pay up.'' 
The executive also said most energy traders expected that Dynegy would obtain a much lower merger price because Enron had little or no room to fight a renegotiation. 
''If Enron hasn't lined something else up, their other choice is bankruptcy,'' he said. ''You can guess what shareholder value is going to look like if that's the case.'' 



Report: U.S. Pipelines a Target / FBI warns gas, oil firms of vague threat

Washington - According to an unverified intelligence report, Osama bin Laden has ordered retaliatory attacks on U.S. natural gas supplies should he or the Taliban's leader be killed or captured, Attorney General John Ashcroft said yesterday. 
The U.S. oil and natural gas industry confirmed yesterday that it went on a higher stage of alert within the past two weeks after the FBI advised the American Petroleum Institute and other national industry groups of the vague, alleged threat. 
On Nov. 17, the FBI sent e-mails to its 56 field offices across the country - but not to state and local law enforcement officials - about the alleged threat, which is being taken seriously although the agency has not determined whether it is credible, Justice officials said. 
The notice warned that bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the event he or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was captured or killed. The FBI said the information "was from a source of undetermined reliability." 
Asked about the notice yesterday, Ashcroft said, "Frankly, those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously ... and we work to elevate our security to alert the interested industry groups, to alert law enforcement." 
Ashcroft sought to downplay the threat as an act of retaliation ordered by bin Laden, the U.S. government's prime suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks and the leader of al-Qaida terrorist network now being pursued by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 
"I don't believe al-Qaida operates on the basis of triggering attacks. ... This is an organization motivated by hate," Ashcroft said. "We are at risk not based on our activities, but based on their malicious despising of the United States." 
Justice officials said the natural gas threat lacked the verification that led Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller to publicly issue nationwide alerts twice last month. 
The notice about the natural gas threat was one of many the FBI has sent to its field offices for vigilance and communication to those who might be affected, a Justice official said. 
The notice of the natural gas threat came after Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) on Nov. 7 forced federal regulators to reconsider a permit that would allow the reopening of a liquefied natural gas plant at Cove Point in Maryland. She warned that "the Cove Point facility is within three miles of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant, and the ships carrying liquefied natural gas from Algeria or other countries will be under foreign flag with foreign crews." 
Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan. 
There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America, making protection difficult. Aerial monitoring has increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations, industry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press. 
Also, some detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said. 



Investors bet Enron deal will go bust ; Dynegy could kill deal or drop price

As Dynegy Inc. continued to scrutinize merger partner Enron Corp.'s tangled finances, Wall Street traders bet that Dynegy is on the verge of either calling off the Enron buyout it announced three weeks ago or renegotiating a much cheaper price for its once- highflying rival. 
"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms," said A.G. Edwards analyst Michael Heim. 
The New York Times reported the companies as early as Tuesday could announce a new deal, which could reduce by nearly half Dynegy's $9 billion takeover offer. 
Under terms of the original agreement between the two Houston- based energy concerns, Enron stockholders are to swap each of their shares for little more than a quarter-share of Dynegy stock, which closed Monday at $39.25. That would value Enron shares at $10.54. 
If investors believed the stock-for-stock deal was likely to go through, they would be willing to pay something very close to that price for Enron shares--but they're not. 
As investor doubts have grown, so has the gap between the buyout price and the trading price of Enron's stock. On Monday, Enron's battered shares slid to their lowest level in years, dropping 70 cents, or 15 percent, to close at $4.01. 
Enron's market capitalization--the value of the company's approximately 850 million shares--has plunged to $3.41 billion. In February, Enron's market cap was about $70 billion. 
With Monday's slippage, Enron shares are trading at a 62 percent discount to the Dynegy offer. The shares of acquisition targets typically trade at a less than 10 percent discount to the deal price after a merger announcement. 
Dynegy saying little 
As Dynegy's audit team continued its in-depth review of Enron's books Monday, a company spokesman declined to discuss rumors swirling around the deal. "The due diligence continues," said John Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman. "We're looking closely at Enron." 
Asked about one analyst's recent projection that Dynegy may renegotiate the transaction's exchange ratio and give Enron holders just 0.15 Dynegy shares for each Enron share, rather than the agreed upon 0.2685 ratio, Sousa said, "We don't comment on speculation." 
There is no shortage of speculation of late in the "soap opera that is Enron," said commentator Carol Levenson of the Gimme Credit bond market newsletter. 
Levenson suggested that "there's a game of chicken going on between Enron, its bankers, its ostensible merger partner, Dynegy, and the rating agencies." Any of the parties "could send this company over the edge at any moment," she said, and Enron "is in an increasingly weak negotiating position." 
Enron's fall from grace has been astonishingly swift and painful for its stockholders, some of whom are suing the company for allegedly using misleading accounting measures to conceal the shaky state of its finances. 
With Monday's drop, Enron shares have tumbled 95 percent from the $82 they commanded just 10 months ago. 
Once a regional pipeline operator known as Houston Natural Gas, Enron transformed itself during the 1990s through an ambitious expansion plan. It acquired electric utility operations, built overseas power plants and developed an innovative energy trading operation. 
Partnership woes 
The strategy made Enron a stock market darling, but it also periodically strained the company's liquidity. To help keep its credit ratings strong, the company created limited partnerships that allowed Enron to keep billions of dollars in debt obligations off its books and out of sight of most investors. 
While Enron's power trading group has experienced operating problems of late, it is the limited partnerships--some of which were managed by Enron officials--that proved to be the company's downfall. 
In October, Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to buy back 55 million shares it had issued to the partnerships. The charge associated with "unwinding" the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen $618 million third-quarter loss. It also spurred a markdown of Enron's credit ratings to just above junk-bond status, as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's partnership practices. 
As further accounting difficulties surfaced, Enron's finances have turned increasingly shaky, and some other trading companies, fearing exposure to Enron's problems, have become reluctant do new transactions with the company. 
As part of the buyout arrangement, Dynegy's 26 percent owner, Chevron-Texaco Corp., has given Enron $1.5 billion in upfront cash; in exchange, Dynegy obtained rights that would allow it to acquire the desirable Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline if the deal falls through. 
Dynegy has the right to walk away from the deal if Enron suffers what's known as a "material adverse change." But as Tyson Foods Inc. found out this year when it unsuccessfully sought to break its agreement to buy meatpacker IBP Inc. after an accounting mess at IBP, proving such a claim can be difficult.

Re ''In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze'' (Business Day, Nov. 20): 
As Congress and federal investigators begin looking into a host of questions about management's role in the company's collapse, I note that the Bush-G.O.P. ''stimulus'' plan calls for United States taxpayers to give Enron $254 million.
Since it was Enron management's greed that ran the company into multibillion-dollar debt, why should we citizens pay for its irresponsibility?

Top Companies Issuing Debt At a Fast Pace
By STEPHANIE STROM

11/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

In the weeks since the attack on the World Trade Center, blue-chip corporations have issued a torrent of debt. 
Ford, General Electric, I.B.M., Kraft, AT&T, General Motors and other companies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as investors, disenchanted with the stock market, have all but begged to buy their debt. In all, companies have issued 31.5 percent more debt in the last 11 weeks than they did in the period a year earlier.
The companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain basement prices, thanks to low interest rates, and to retire more expensive debt. 
But they may also have little-discussed concerns that money will be scarce in the future, particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recovery is less vigorous than economists now hope. Bank lending is at a 30-year low, according to the Conference Board, and buyers are hard to find for commercial paper, the short-term, cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on. Standard & Poor's says the amount of commercial paper issued by nonfinancial companies has shrunk roughly 30 percent this year. 
''Companies now can lock in substantially lower overall borrowing costs,'' said William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan. ''They have an opportunity to build a war chest to help them get through the hard times, and they're taking advantage of it.'' 
Before the terrorist attacks, analysts were expecting the issuing of debt to slow late this year after a tremendous first half. 
So much for expectations. Ford originally planned to raise $3 billion; it was able to raise $9.4 billion and is said to be thinking about trying to raise $7 billion more. 
Kraft Foods, part of the Philip Morris Companies, had planned to issue $2 billion worth of bonds. Instead, it offered $4 billion. 
AT&T raised $10.1 billion, twice as much as it originally planned. AT&T's and Ford's issues rank as the second- and third-largest ever. 
All told, 573 corporations have issued $181 billion of debt since Sept. 11, compared with 692 companies that raised $138 billion in the period last year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
''When you look at other asset classes, the corporate bond market offers some of the better values,'' said Bob LoBue, head of the investment-grade fixed-income syndicate at J. P. Morgan, which has underwritten roughly half the issues that have come to market since Sept. 11. ''There's still a lack of confidence in stock valuations based on the weakness we're seeing in earnings.'' 
Issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on Treasury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt. Corporate bonds are often priced in relation to United States government debt, and thanks to a cascade of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, well-heeled companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates. 
International Business Machines, for instance, recently sold $1.5 billion worth of five-year notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued, 4.875 percent. 
Others, though, read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a sign that credit is getting tight. Investment-grade companies typically juggle a smorgasbord of debt -- short, intermediate and long term -- but they are definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days. No doubt, that is because debt is cheap -- but it also suggests that they may foresee a time when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests Mr. Cunningham referred to. 
It was not so long ago, after all, that companies experienced a credit shortage. ''A credit crunch was brewing last year,'' Mr. Cunningham said, ''until the Fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates, which averted it.'' 
But a cash problem persists in some ways despite the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate cuts. ''We are in a cash crisis like none we have experienced in recent memory,'' said James Padilla, a Ford executive, in a recent memorandum to his staff. 
Many companies with less-than-pristine credit ratings have trouble raising money and may be having more because of the stampede by blue-chip companies. 
''When companies like Ford or General Electric come into the market, they squeeze a lot of other, somewhat riskier credits out,'' said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board. 
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said that the economic recovery depended on companies' being able to get credit. 
''My primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum,'' he said. ''We are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next year, but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availability of credit stays where it is or gets worse.'' 
Another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences. ''The Fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of credit exuberance alive,'' Barton M. Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to investors earlier this month. ''The trouble is, although it may work in the short run, in the long run the debt burden will be bigger and the adjustment process more painful.'' 
The automakers, for example, are using the money they have raised in part to support the customer incentive programs that offer zero-interest financing. They are paying as much as 7.25 percent, in other words, to lend money to car buyers for nothing. 
Some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper. But companies are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal. 
The longer-term money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commercial paper, even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time. The spread -- the difference in interest rates between Treasuries and corporate bonds -- has generally widened since Sept. 11, although not across the board. 
''There is a cost factor involved, but we try to minimize that,'' said David Moore, manager of fixed-income investor relations at Ford Credit, which accounted for the bulk of the $9.4 billion that Ford borrowed last month. ''We're mindful of our liquidity, and want to make sure we ensure it.'' 
Like many of the companies issuing debt, Ford is curbing its dependence on the commercial paper market. For the year through Oct. 16, Ford had cut the amount of paper it had outstanding by almost 60 percent, to $17 billion. ''That puts us in a very good position, given our rating,'' said Mr. Moore, who was one of the few executives willing to discuss his company's strategy. 
Ford, like a host of other companies, has had its credit ratings cut. Many buyers of commercial paper, like money market funds, lend to only the highest-rated companies. So far this year, Standard & Poor's has knocked 57 companies out of the top ratings for commercial paper, compared with 49 last year. 
The total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen 30 percent this year, according to Diane Vazza, head of global financial investment research at Standard & Poor's, thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among investors. ''We've seen some issuers driven out of the market,'' Ms. Vazza said. 
According to several credit analysts, DaimlerChrysler was scheduled to roll over $7 billion of commercial paper in June but decided to take the offering to Europe, where investors are less particular about ratings quality. 
Similarly, Enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem commercial paper as its credit ratings fell. 
The decline in AT&T's commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big issue last week. 
But underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial paper market has more to do with companies' ability to borrow for the long term cheaply than with their inability to issue short-term debt. ''Short-term financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to roll it over in order to maintain liquidity,'' said Mr. LoBue of J. P. Morgan. 
The underwriters concede, however, that lending by banks has all but dried up, falling to its lowest level in three decades. Bank lending has been curtailed at the behest of Federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury Department, putting them seemingly at cross-purposes with the Fed. 
The chief executive of EchoStar, Charles W. Ergen, had to put up $2.75 billion of his own money to complete the purchase of the Hughes Electronic Corporation. The bankers at UBS Warburg, EchoStar's adviser on the deal, had offered to provide the financing, but only with a proviso that would have let the bank back out of the deal under certain conditions. 
Although the company later got financing from Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank, many other bankers have privately applauded UBS Warburg's caution.

Enron, Dynegy deal back on table 
Energy traders said to be renegotiating premium for shares 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Dynegy and Enron Corp. could announce new terms for Dynegy's deal to buy Enron as soon as today, according to sources familiar with talks between the two companies. 
The two Houston-based energy traders, the sources said, spent the weekend and Monday discussing, among other issues, a lower exchange rate for Dynegy's stock deal to buy Enron. 
As of Monday evening, no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions were continuing, the sources said, cautioning that the situation was fluid. 
Also Monday: 
? Enron and Dynegy, the sources said, were working to finalize terms for an equity infusion into Enron of around $500 million that's expected to come from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. Another equity infusion from other parties could come later, the sources said. 
? Enron, Dynegy and a group of banks were negotiating terms for a so-called "override" agreement that would extend, until after the merger closed, maturity dates for certain debt Enron is due to repay or that could come due before, the sources said. It was unclear how much of approximately the $9 billion in obligations Enron could have coming due in the next 12 months that would be covered by that restructuring. 
? It was expected that Enron would start layoffs sometime this week. 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said her only comment was that any action the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees. 
? California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, not known for harboring a favorable attitude toward Enron or other Texas energy companies, has started reviewing the planned merger, looking for potential antitrust problems, his office said. Dynegy has power plants there, while Enron sells power and natural gas into the state. 
? Shares in both companies fell, with Enron closing down 70 cents at $4.01, while shares in Dynegy ended the day down $1.15 at $39.25. 
The talks between Enron and Dynegy come amid Wall Street expectations that Dynegy will renegotiate the merger terms or back out of the deal completely. The sources said that at the moment, the companies aren't discussing canceling the deal. 
On Nov. 9, the day Dynegy announced it would acquire its troubled rival, shares in Enron closed at $8.63, while shares in Dynegy closed at $38.76. 
The merger agreement calls for Enron shareholders to get 0.2685 share of Dynegy per Enron share. Based on the Nov. 9 closing prices, Dynegy would be paying $10.41 a share for Enron. 
But since, Enron's share prices have dropped significantly amid increasing concerns about its ability to maintain its core trading business and troubling new disclosures about its financial shape. 
Based on Monday's closing prices, Dynegy would be paying more -- $10.54 a share -- for Enron, which is worth considerably less based on market capitalization than when the deal was announced. 
Last week, one stock analyst said he thought a ratio of no more than 0.15 share of Dynegy per Enron share might be more realistic. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Monday that Dynegy was continuing its "due diligence" review of Enron's books and "looking at everything very closely." 
Unless the merger with Dynegy goes through, Enron could be forced into bankruptcy protection. 
Enron's core trading business has eroded, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its finances and it faces a pile of debt as well as an increasing number of shareholder and employee lawsuits. 
Enron and Dynegy hoped the merger deal, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion of equity into Enron, would stabilize Enron. 
But new financial disclosures have had the opposite effect. 
For example, on Nov. 19, Enron revealed $690 million in debt would come due sooner than expected because of a credit-rating downgrade. 
The news came as a surprise even to Dynegy. 
Dynegy has escape hatches in its merger agreement, including a "material adverse change" clause that applies generally to Enron's financial state. 
Also, if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than $3.5 billion, the deal can be called off. 
Sousa described the escape clauses as "broad provisions" to ensure Dynegy is adequately protected.

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Whether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likely to deeply affect one of Houston's largest law offices: the one within the embattled company. 
"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston," said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest firms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone. 
Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. That's a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000 employees. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100 survey released in May. 
Energy trader Enron's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor, Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy. 
Whatever the company's fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers. 
Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron's legal staff, speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent. 
"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through," said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyers here. 
Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but it also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for either Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outside firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created. 
Enron's legal department has siphoned talent from Houston's top law firms over the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising lawyers lured away by Enron's competitive pay combined with stock options, which were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percent of their value. 
"Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country," said Jeff Love, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm with about 175 of its lawyers here. 
Enron has hired a lot of what are called "laterals," or lawyers who have had a couple years training, often at a big firm. 
Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier than big-firm life, that's not the reputation of Enron's legal eagles. 
As with the company itself, the general counsel's office has been known as innovative and hard driving. 
"I don't think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an ordinary life," Ayers said. 
In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around $110,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company. 
If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expect casualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad for job-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom in rough times. 
Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don't expect to scale back their business in the immediate future. 
Should the merger succeed, Enron's 245 lawyers will join Dynegy's 43. 
"The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of things associated with the merger, won't be worked out for some time," Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.

Bin Laden threat against pipelines taken seriously 
Ashcroft: Unconfirmed warning linked to leader's death, capture 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The FBI confirmed Monday that it has warned the energy industry that Osama bin Laden may have ordered strikes against U.S. natural gas facilities if he is caught or killed. 
The agency issued the warning last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a news conference Monday. It had uncorroborated information that bin Laden may have approved plans for such attacks, Ashcroft added. 
The FBI warning said "such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed." 
The warning hit home in Houston because while the warning did not single out a target, it referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines. Houston is the hub of this industry and is at the center of a dense web of gas pipelines. 
The warning was considered similar to the one issued earlier about potential attacks against West Coast bridges. 
Ashcroft said the government is in regular communication with companies that own the nation's energy infrastructure, such as refineries, natural gas pipelines and nuclear plants. 
Federal law enforcement officials received the uncorroborated report of undetermined reliability about a potential attack against natural gas supplies about 10 days ago, Ashcroft said. 
Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, all energy companies have established more stringent security measures. Pipelines, however, are considered especially vulnerable since they are accessible above ground in remote areas with typically little more than a padlock and a metal fence to keep out someone wanting to damage the line. 
Reliant Energy Entex, the natural gas distribution company that serves the Houston area, was notified about the warning but has not added any new security measures as a result, company spokeswoman Alicia Dixon said. 
"We've been on a heightened state of alert since Sept. 11 so nothing is different today than it was yesterday," Dixon said. "We have very strong security in place already because of the nature of our business. We have to be prepared to deal with a variety of emergencies." 
Dixon said the company recieved word of the warning from the American Gas Association. The American Petroleum Institute also passed the warning on to energy companies, API spokesman Juan Palomo said. 
Enron notified its employees of the warning and also has been on heightened state of alert since Sept. 11, company spokeswoman Gina Taylor said. 
"We take all threats seriously," Taylor said. 
Enron monitors its pipelines and related facilities such as compression stations using planes, cars and on foot, she said. The company has not added staff to beef up its security as a result of the warning, she said. 
"We routinely patrol the right of way," she said. 
There are thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines running throughout the nation. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
Detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said. 
Federal regulators have offered help to pay for the added protection by speeding rate hike requests for beefed-up security. 
If a pipeline were attacked with an explosive, for example, the operator could shut off the flow of natural gas, oil or refined products from either side of the break.

Current recession differs from others 
By JIM BARLOW 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
So it's official. The United States is in a recession. 
That was the word Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research. A recession, by the by, comes about after six months of declining economic activity. In this case, the bureau said, the recession started last March, so we're already through almost nine months of slowdown. 
But there's something very different about this recession, different from all the others we've experienced in the past four or five decades. We were not led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse in those prices. 
The current recession was sparked by a high-tech collapse, led by a glut of technology products. 
That doesn't mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession. There are places that will be hurting. San Francisco comes to mind. It is a high-tech center, and there was a lot of building to accommodate that industry. 
There is also one real estate sector in trouble -- the hotel industry. It had already been hurt by a downturn in business travel. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks sent it, and air travel, reeling. 
Recall see-through buildings?
But there's nothing like we saw back in the mid-1980s. Remember when Houston enriched the nation's vocabulary by coming up with the term see-through buildings? Those were the many skyscrapers in Houston that had been built but never finished inside. So you could look right through them because there were no interior walls. 
Indeed, if real estate is a bright spot in this recession, real estate in Houston is a great shining light. 
Houston's office building market is tight. The downtown office market has an 8.9 percent vacancy rate, and prime Class A space prized by major corporations is effectively full. There should be some easing of that rate. Enron Corp., with its well-publicized freefall, has almost completed a new headquarters. Even more space will be coming onto the market when the 32-story Calpine Center office tower is completed at 717 Texas Ave. in 2003. 
Century Development has announced it is working on a 40-story office tower downtown. Crescent Real Estate Equities is building a tower on the other side of Main Street. All this, plus cutbacks at Continental Airlines and the pending sale of Compaq Computer Corp. to Hewlett-Packard Co., will doubtless hurt the office market. But no one is predicting disaster. 
The Houston apartment market may be the nation's healthiest, with 93.5 percent of Houston's apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year. That figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before. Prices for apartments are up, as are rents. 
Sales of used homes in October were the highest ever, with the median price up 3.9 percent. New-home sales are setting records. 
Developers are optimists
So how did we escape the usual? Credit lenders. 
Real estate developing is full of optimists. Ask any developer -- even in the midst of a bust -- and he'll tell you. It won't affect his building, which somehow is nicer, sexier or even more depression-proof than the next guy's. Give a developer money, and he will build. 
Lenders have been as tight as the bark on trees. That has forced developers to pre-lease buildings and seek partners with equity -- primarily pension funds -- before the banks would loan them money for new projects. 
Several things happen to the real estate business during a recession. Prices fall or stabilize -- and in this particular recession the bet is probably on stabilization. The banks and others that loan that money generally tighten credit standards, cutting off weaker real estate players. And the Federal Reserve Board helps out the economy by lowering rates, which aids bargain hunters with deep pockets. 
In any recession, even one that is as benign to real estate as this one, some properties won't survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sell or file for bankruptcy. 
With the current low interest rates, companies with good credit will move in and buy those properties. Remember the so-called vulture funds of the 1980s? 
How soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession. Because real estate is in good shape this time, the process is not as important as it was in the 1980s. Still, if investors promptly snap up distressed properties, that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short one. 



Enron Gains on Optimism Dynegy Purchase to Proceed (Update1)
2001-11-27 07:59 (New York)

     (Updates to add Instinet trading, comment by Tice.)

     Houston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares rose as
much as 3.5 percent on Instinet amid optimism Dynegy Inc. will
proceed with its proposed acquisition of the rival U.S. energy
trader after renegotiating the terms of its offer.

     Shares of the energy trader plunged 55 percent last week on
concern the merger would unravel after Enron said it had more debt
and less cash than previously announced, threatening its ability
to operate until Dynegy completes the purchase.

     Executives of the two companies discussed possible changes in
the terms over the weekend, people familiar with the matter said
yesterday. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15
shares for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about
$5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people close to the discussions.

     ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file
for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris
Harris, a Houston-based financial services company.

     Enron shares rose as much as 14 cents to $4.15 on Instinet.
The original Dynegy bid valued Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy
stock. The discount reflects skepticism among investors the
acquisition will be completed under the original terms.

     Bond investors were less optimistic. The company's 6.4
percent bonds that mature in 2006 declined to 45 cents on the
dollar from 48 cents on the dollar yesterday, traders said. At
that price, the bonds yield 28.5 percent.

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank. Last week's Securities and
Exchange Commission filing ``had a lot of negative surprises.''

     Investors have become concerned because Enron hasn't been
able to complete a proposal to raise $2 billion through a private
equity sale and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to
downgrade the company's credit rating.

                           Extension?

     The companies may announce as early as today an extension by
some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500 million cash
infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and an
agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits
over Enron's employee-retirement plan, the New York Times said.

     Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman
John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

     ``If they can renegotiate the deal to half (the original
price), that's where you get really attractive earnings,'' said
Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a
``buy.''

                         Enron's Debt

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more, Howald said. Barone has reduced his
estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings from $1.65 a share to 75 cents.

     Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25
yesterday.

      New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the
additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors
said.

     ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that
kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses --
trading, pipelines and energy management -- are still sound,''
said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets
in the Strong Utilities Fund, 4.3 percent of which is Dynegy
stock.

    Enron has debt payments of more than $9 billion due before the
end of 2002, and has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines
left, the company said in a filing last week. If its cash reserves
run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment
grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two
affiliated partnerships.

                           Reprieve

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed a 10-Q quarterly report with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Nov. 9, it rated
Enron's debt one notch above junk. The rating company's analysts
didn't return calls seeking comment.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB,'' a level below investment grade.
     The Houston-based company also said in the filing that it had
a $690 million note due this week, and that it may have to reduce
fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million. The write-off would come
because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated
partnership, and the value of that stock has plunged.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line.
Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was
``encouraged'' by the developments.

     Enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt, Denne
said yesterday. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup executives met today to
line up investors willing to buy $2 billion in bonds convertible
into Enron stock.

                       Deteriorating Daily

     Many of Enron's trading partners are shunning the company,
and some analysts now say Enron's 2002 earnings may hurt, rather
than boost, Dynegy's earnings, as Watson has projected.

     ``The value of the assets Dynegy is trying to buy -- the
trading and marketing businesses -- are deteriorating on a daily
basis as more counterparties back off on trading and dealing with
Enron,'' said Mike Heim, a securities analyst at A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc.

     Watson said on Nov. 9 that the merger would increase Houston-
based Dynegy's 2002 earnings by 35 percent to $3.40 to $3.50 a
share.

     To realize those gains, Watson will have to help Enron stay
out of bankruptcy by helping it get financing, Vuchetich said.

    ``Dynegy needs to make sure there's no hint the trading
operation is worth less than they thought,'' Vuchetich said. ``It
has to be kept running to maintain its value.''

Pressure Mounts on Enron Buyout Energy: Stock drops to its lowest since '87 on doubts Dynegy deal will go through. Workers sue over shrinking 401(k)s.

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. shares Monday sank to a low not seen since the 1987 stock market crash, as investors continued to mark down the chances of the energy trader's completing its pending buyout by rival Dynegy Inc. 
Enron stock tumbled 70 cents, or 15%, to $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy fell $1.15, or 3%, to $39.25 on the Big Board.
The pressure on Enron is mounting not just from Wall Street but from regulators, bond-rating agencies, the energy trading community and Enron's own employees, many of them angered by the devastation of their retirement accounts as the company's stock has plunged 95% this year. 
An employee lawsuit was filed Monday in federal court in Houston, alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company stock for their 401(k) retirement plans. 
About 15,000 Enron employees are owed a total of $890 million in compensation for losses sustained in their retirement accounts, said Eli Gottesdiener, whose Washington firm represents the plaintiffs. 
One of the plaintiffs, Gary Kemper, a maintenance foreman with Enron's Portland General Electric unit in Oregon, said the total value of his 401(k) account has shrunk to $129,000 from $317,000 this year as his Enron holdings collapsed to about $9,000 from $197,000. 
"It wouldn't tick me off so bad except that they were sending us e-mail after e-mail [last summer] saying things are fine," Kemper said in an interview Monday, referring to company executives. "Of course, we find out later that they were dumping their own stock, millions of dollars at a time." 
Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay cashed in stock and options worth $123 million last year, when the stock was near its peak. 
Kemper and his wife had been planning to retire early, four years from now, but it is no longer clear that they will be able to afford it, he said. 
Another law firm representing Enron employees, Seattle-based Hagens Berman, is looking into the possibility of adding Enron's accounting firm as a defendant, partner Karl Barth said Monday. 
The accountant, Andersen, has been criticized for failing to catch irregularities that caused Enron to restate its earnings dating back to 1997 and declare its previous financial reports unreliable. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co., a credit-rating agency in suburban Philadelphia, on Monday cut its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, saying the company will need $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next 45 days to fund operating losses and other liabilities. 
Egan-Jones dropped Enron's bonds to the sub-investment-grade, or junk, level in August, about when the company's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned. The agency's view is more severe than those of larger rivals Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, which both continue to keep Enron's debt in the investment-grade category. 
Sean Egan, a managing director of Egan-Jones, said he views the chances of the merger going through at less than 50-50. And if the merger falls through, Enron's chances of survival are not very high, he said. 
Dynegy has kept mum about the deal since Wednesday, when it said it was trying to speed regulatory approvals. Wall Street analysts have noted that Dynegy could invoke terms of a "material adverse change" clause allowing it to modify or walk away from the deal if it determines that Enron's condition is markedly worse than it was when the deal was struck Nov. 9. 
Under the merger deal, Enron shareholders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each of their shares. That implied a value of $10.54 a share, more than double Enron's closing price Monday. The gap indicates Wall Street's doubts about whether the deal will get done. 
Elsewhere Monday, the office of California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer reiterated that it will scrutinize the Dynegy-Enron merger on antitrust grounds. 
Analysts say California could use its power to delay the deal as a way to squeeze Dynegy for better prices on long-term power contracts it negotiated during the height of the state's energy crisis this year. 
Enron already is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over controversial deals involving limited partnerships organized and run by former company executives.

Man arrested for issuing e-mail threat to Enron

PUNE: If youre thinking of sending scary, anonymous emails, think again.The police are fast catching up on the technology to trace such mails. On Friday, the Ratnagiri police arrested Pune-based computer professional Habibuddin Sheikh 20). 
A former employee of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC) Sheikh had sent an email threatening to blow up DPCs Guhagar plant.
According to the Ratnagiri police, DPC received the threatening mail last month.The company was being targeted because it was a venture of the American giant Enron, the mail said. Superintendent of police Vinaykumar Chaube immediately formed a special team and tracked the mail down to a cybercafe in Wanowrie in Pune. 
The cybercafe records revealed that Sheikh had used the cyber cafe at the time and day on which the mail was received by DPC.The investigators were already working on the hunch that the mail must have been the handiwork of one of the 1,000 workers retrenched by the company. Sheikhs handwriting in the companys records too matched.

USA: Calif. Attorney Gen'l to examine Dynegy-Enron deal.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov 26 (Reuters) - California's attorney general will examine Dynegy Inc.'s bid to buy its much larger energy rival, Enron Corp. , officials said Monday, adding a potential new wrinkle to the troubled $9 billion merger proposal. 
"We are reviewing the merger for anti-trust concerns," said Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
Michioku said it was still far too early to say what position California would take on the proposed merger, which involves two companies often publicly blamed for helping to create California's energy crisis this year. 
Dynegy was among five energy companies named in a lawsuit filed in May by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante alleging energy price manipulation at several southern California power plants it owns. Dynegy has denied the accusation. 
Enron, while owning no generation plants in California, is a major national player for energy trading and natural gas transmission - which if merged with Dynegy's market presence in the state could create a major new energy powerhouse. 
The proposed merger, which has been plagued by uncertainty amid news of major new Enron debt and a resulting slump in its share price, is already being examined by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
California regulators could present a roadblock to successful completion of the deal. But the state could also leverage its influence over the merger to renegotiate a number of long-term energy deals with Dynegy, which it signed months ago at the height of its power crisis and which are now being criticized as a bad deal for the state's consumers.

Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2)

Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2)

     (Adds reports on stock ratio and bank extensions in seventh
and eighth paragraphs.)

     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may renegotiate
terms of its proposed $22.9 billion purchase of Enron Corp., whose
shares have fallen 54 percent since the merger was announced,
people familiar with talks between the companies said.

     Executives of the two energy-trading companies discussed
possible changes in the terms over the weekend, the people said.
The offer made on Nov. 9 values Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy
stock. Enron's stock closed at $4.01, indicating investors don't
believe the sale will be completed under the original terms.

     Enron is seeking as much as $2 billion in equity investment
and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to downgrade the
credit rating of the energy trader, which said last week its debt
was higher than earlier reported. Enron needs to offer more
attractive terms or risk losing the support of Dynegy investors
for a deal needed to save the company, analysts said.

     ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file
for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris
Harris.

     Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman
John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout
agreement are underway.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

                            Half Price?

     Enron and Dynegy are talking about cutting the ratio to less
than 0.15, which would value the stock portion of the transaction
at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per Enron share, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions.

     In addition, the companies may announce as early as today an
extension by some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500
million cash infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co., and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite

     Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25.

                       Additional Financing

     New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the
additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors
said.

     ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that
kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses --

Enron Faces New Employee Suit Alleging Securities Violations
2001-11-26 21:53 (New York)

Enron Faces New Employee Suit Alleging Securities Violations

     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the energy
trader and producer whose shares hit a 14-year low today, is being
sued for allegedly violating federal securities law by selling
employees company stock without a prospectus.

     The suit was filed in Houston by Gary Kemper, a 57-year-old
maintenance foreman at an Enron affiliate, and seeks to recover
$850 million in losses, said his attorney, Eli Gottesdiener. The
suit claims Enron prevented employees under the age of 50 from
selling stock they received from the company as 401(k) matching
contributions.

     Houston-based Enron, whose bond and stock prices fell amid
concern Dynegy Inc. may abandon its $23 billion proposed bid for
the company, faces at least two other lawsuits seeking to recover
losses from employee 401(k) accounts. The previous suits did not
raise the prospectus claim.

     Enron shares fell 70 cents to $4.01 after trading as low as
$3.76 today. They've dropped 95 percent this year. Company
spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the suit, citing
the company's policy on pending litigation.

Enron Plunges, but Dynegy Will Suffer, Too
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

In the Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) endgame, both players look set to lose. 
The other player is energy trader Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) , which this month agreed to buy Enron. Since the deal was announced, Enron's fundamentals have rapidly deteriorated, making Dynegy's offer look ridiculously generous. But even if the deal gets done at more advantageous terms, Dynegy will struggle to revive a disembowled Enron and absorb its hefty debt load. 
Making matters worse, Dynegy could suffer just as much if it backs out of the deal. Without a merger, Houston-based Enron almost certainly goes to the wall, causing disruption, stress and profit-sapping change in the energy market. How can Dynegy not get wounded in that environment? The stock market doesn't seem to agree, however; Dynegy shares remain above their predeal levels. 
Wishful Thinking
A Dynegy spokesman says his company can post annual earnings growth of 20% to 25% over the next two years even without Enron. He declined to comment on the merger negotiations, except to say that Dynegy is "continuing its due diligence" of Enron. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on deal talks. 
Where do things stand as of Monday evening? Well, the deal looks increasingly unlikely to happen (at least on the terms of Nov. 9). After a sickening slide last week, Enron tanked again Monday, dropping 15% to $4.01. Current deal terms have Dynegy paying around $10.50 an Enron share based on its current stock price. A 60% gap says the deal won't get done. But, as the world and his wife now know, the deal needs to go through for Enron to maintain the investment grade credit rating necessary for its survival. 
Clearly, every hour counts in this fast-unwinding situation. Enron's core trading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to the company, draining it of precious cash. 
As a result, two options exist from here. The first is a rescue effort involving Dynegy, the rating agencies and bank creditors like J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to buy Enron time. This could involve changing the stock-swap ratio to give Dynegy a cheaper price, with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with other investors to inject equity. 
The other scenario has Dynegy, after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skeletons in the closet, deciding to back out altogether, leaving Enron with no rescuer and no future. But Dynegy's resilient stock price suggests that the market hasn't grasped the impact an Enron bankruptcy would have on Dynegy and other trading firms. 
Don't be at all surprised if, any moment now, we see one last attempt to salvage Dynegy's rescue merger with new terms. Several banks are exposed to Enron and, presumably, they will try almost anything -- including extending debt -- to keep the company afloat. By keeping deeply distressed Enron at an investment-grade rating, rating agencies such as Moody's have shown themselves willing to bend to the banks' wishes, so they will probably capitulate again if pressured by bank honchos. 
Be Careful What You Wish For
But swallowing Enron would hardly be good for Dynegy, which appears to have underestimated the former's problems. 
Amazingly, just a couple of weeks back, the company expected Enron to make $1.50 per share in 2002. Goldman Sachs is now expecting 50 cents, even if the merger gets done. If Dynegy ended up paying, say, $3 a share for Enron, people would no doubt hail that as a low-enough price to cover worsened fundamentals, legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from Enron's notoriously murky books. But recall that Dynegy also would be taking on Enron's $13 billion of debt. Include the debt in some return-on-capital calculations and the deal still looks untenable. 
Alternatively, Enron may be deteriorating too fast to save. That's also bad for Dynegy. The damage done to the company by depleted energy market activity has been recognized, as has the risk that an Enron collapse could leave Dynegy dangerously unhedged on many of its trades. What does that mean and why is it dangerous? Let's say Dynegy agreed to buy power from Company X over a period of time and then sell it to Enron. If Enron goes down, its obligation to buy from Dynegy obviously disappears, but Dynegy can't easily back out of the commitment to buy power from Company X. 
And there's another potential risk that the market really hasn't recognized. Enron allegedly was very aggressive in booking upfront profits on forward market deals. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on that allegation. Those deals had to be done with other trading houses, possibly Dynegy. 
In other words, Enron's ways may have contaminated the whole market because, as we are frequently told, Enron was the energy market, just as Drexel Burnham was the junk bond market in the '80s. In Enron's absence, many of the aggressive deals may have to be unwound. Meanwhile, auditors, in a frantic bid to cover their behinds, would start telling trading companies to be a lot more conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals. Suddenly, fat margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get slashed. 
Checkmate -- for both sides. 

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron

11/27/2001

  (This column was first published Monday) 
 
   By Michael Rapoport 
   A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock. 
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Lynn,

Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?

Thanks,

Sue

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

It has come to my attention that changing the operational storage capacity between the Evening process and the NonGrid process can be unduly problematic for customers because most of the pipelines that interconnect with NNG do not recognize the NonGrid process. Such changes can lead to EPSQ issues during the ID1 process when shipper quantities cut during the NonGrid storage allocation end up being less than the EPSQ calculated for ID1. The differences that result will most probably end up as shipper imbalances on NNG. 
For this reason, it is strongly recommended that operational storage capacity not be changed between the Evening and the NonGrid processes in the future.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.

Charlie,

I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed upon difference.

Charlie sent me the following message.
"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

Dari,

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.


Date		Plant PTR		NNG PTR		Difference
9/12/2001	88,335			90,910			2,575

Subject:	RE: TW/ENA compressor deal

Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Subject:	TW/ENA compressor deal

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the Ele compressors.  

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them.  

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli keep us informed of what the new deal will look like.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Lynn, the Commodity invoices are due on 12/24.  I believe Sandy King meant 12/24 rather than the 23rd.  However, I will be watching for the payment!

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Meeting Thursday to discuss ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave Neubauer
Importance:	High

	
	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	Bob, I will be out of the office on Monday, Oct. 22nd., but Donna and John can work with
	Williams and the team to meet on MOPS scheduling.  I would like for you to meet with
	Donna and John before the 22nd to be sure we are comfortable with what information to
	pass back and forth.  

	John, would you take the lead working with Donna and Bob to cover the meeting on Monday.

	Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Service this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tulsa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  This is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  They would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyday to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to capture, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks, 

Bob

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Donna/John
 
Greg will be coming to visit Monday, October 22nd, and in addition to the day-to-day activity we do with MOPS, he is interested in talking about the services we can provide during the interim transition period.  I will be in Lubbock that day, so could one of you be the contact for Greg to call when he gets here?  
 
Donna, Sarabeth has provided the base services agreement to us, so we do have a document to start with, but we still need to find out from Williams what specifically they want us to do. We also need to be aware of the issues Rita has brought up regarding system enhancements that would be necessary to capture bifurcated rates, change the invoice template, provide ad hoc reports to Williams, etc. Sarabeth was deliberate in pointing out that the services agreement did not contemplate assuming liabilities greater than the value of the contract.  In the event Williams requires higher levels of liability, (more than $10,000/mo) we can purchase insurance, and the cost of the premium would be added to our fees.
 
I'll let you know times when I learn of Greg's travel arrangements.
 
Thanks, Bob

Rather than trying to arrange this whole thing by voicemail I thought I would put you gentlemen together and let you work out the details.

Greg Poynter - 918-574-9196 is the mgr of out gas scheduling and gas control systems.  Greg wants to vist the NNG office to talk about the interim agmt and the way NNG does the gas management on MOPS.

Bob Burleson - 713-853-3084 is our contact in NNG.  Bob will set up a meeting with the proper parties and clear you through the security desk.

Thanks

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

Hasan &/or Gerry
I think there are some misunderstanding on what activity is included in a Plainview allocation. What needs to be done, as a 1st step, to initiate revisions to the Plainview allocation?

1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

Subject:	Plainview Allocations


During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

Subject:	Continental  C- Line receipt


I received a call today from the CMS Beaver plant and they have shut their process plant down due to gas prices. They do not know at this time  when they will start back processing . This is the same thing that happen last December. They have assured us that the gas that they are delivering to us is going through a Dehy and a mole sieve to knock any water out. The BTU of the gas received on the C-line will be running around 1150 BTU. We will need to keep a close watch on the C-line suction water content during this time. This is the first call I have received about a processing plant shutting down due to price this month.

FYI,

I got a call form Larry at Bushton. He said they having trouble with a pump in the treater plant. They haven?t received the spare pump yet, so there could be a possibility that the treater plant could be down this weekend. Which means Lyons would be down. They just wanted to give us a heads up, so we can figure this in our weekend plan.

President Bush announced he has decided to expand the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to "maximize long-tern protection against oil supply disruptions."

Mr. John Shages, Director of Economic Planning, Policy, and Finance for the
United State's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) will address the World
Energy Security and Commerce forum on January 24, 2002. (http://www.wesc.org )

Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve up to capacity will strengthen the long-term energy
security of the United States. Since its inception, the circumstances that might require the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have been defined in the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. Yet each time economic or political circumstances bring the SPR into focus, questions, concerns, and misunderstandings ARE abound.  Mr. Shages will address firsthand the reasons behind the formation of the SPR, the circumstances under which it may be used, and the economics behind its administration. Topics such as inventory levels, drawdown capabilities,
exchanges and sales will be discussed in relation to today's domestic
security needs and concerns."

A worksheet is available in T:\COMMON\AR  GT_3Days COM08.xls of commodity invoices billed August 2001 accounting month that have not cleared AR. 

Please update the Excel worksheet by 5 p.m. on Thursday (10/18) to reflect any payments that have been received but not cleared in SAP or to report the date your shipper will remit payment. If your shipper is not paying or short paying the invoices, include the reason. Provide a copy of  your payment detail or SAP report to me to support unapplied payments. 

Also, there are 30 outstanding August 2001 DEMAND invoices totaling $84,487 that are outstanding. Please apply any payments immediately or advise me of any disputed issues concerning these invoices. (The affected analysts have been given a report of the invoices to be resolved.)

The new cash application process should be used to apply payments. (See T:\Common\Market Services Training\ARNettingProcedures.ppt  to get a copy of the procedures.) 

Let me know if you have questions or need assistance.

        Chris, I only got info on the Mid Am Oct. charts.  I talked to Gary again yesterday and 
        ask for more information.  Hopefully I'll have something today.  Have you already 
        sent your letter to Alliant?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

Hasan,
I could not open this file. Gerry printed it for me. I was not sure I followed the test plan. Is it testing from Oct. 19th to Nov. 2nd?
Since we will have a new model office refresh to deal with on the Oct. 31st, we would like to push to be complete with testing by Wednesday. Oct. 31st, and plan for Thursday night migration which is Nov. 1st.

I will have Kathy Washington, Maggie Matheson, and myself testing for the next two weeks beginning Monday Oct. 22 nd testing through Nov. 1st. Will that work for your team? Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the project plan for TMS migration to SQL2K.

Couple of key items to note.  In order to create an implementation date, I took the liberty of allocating 2 weeks for user testing.  This could change based on customer input.  Additionally, Model Office refresh is very critical.  I have tentatively scheduled it for 10/17 and 10/18.  Any changes to either the Model office refresh dates or the testing schedule will impacting the implementation date.

thanks

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
>From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
>From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late "preliminary" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a "handbook" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

Donna,
Bob Burleson had a conversation with Debra yesterday concerning the Williams training on MOPS. Williams has all the maps and diagrams including volumes they need, all Williams wants is training on the day to day Nominations, Confirmations and Scheduling. So the need for a hand out or packet of information is not needed. Thanks for offering to help.

Thanks:
John Buchanan

Hi everyone,
Attached is the list of all packets ending October 2001.  There are several shippers that are getting cut for today's gas day, which makes their cumulative balance be off the target volume month to date.  The following are the shippers who are off target as of the 18th of October:

Duke
ENA
MidAmerica
NSP Power Pack  (the Power Pack ends in October and should have a zero balance at month end, any residual balance will be transferred to Park and Ride)
Tenaska
Transcanada
Virginia Power

Thank you for working with your shippers in getting their packets to balance.

Reyna Cabrera
(713) 853-3072

	How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?

	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

TW Timely cycle for gas day 12/06/2001 had no significant changes, ENA does have a pooling nomination for the timely cycle but will have no transport fees associated with it.


NNG has a significant change at Border for the gas day of 12/06/2001 an increase of 177 to 78504. ENA nominated an FT contract but had no pre payment nor did the operator confirm the receipt.

I would have no idea of which customers would be sent cut notices or confirmation notices from cycle to cycle it depends on who would gets cut during each cycle. Also we have home office persons that depend on Email to communicate with customers which are Beverly Miller, Shirley Walden and Mary Lou Phillips. We also have in the office Cara Vaughan and Janet McDaniel. I still can not authorize a non emergency outage of Outlook during ETS normal business hours.

Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

All testing was completed successfully, and we have confirmed with ENW Resolution Center that Exchange servers are up. 

Regarding yesterday's issues:
the ENW Resolution Center is researching further the cause of the Outlook problem that caused some people to get a login window when accessing their mail.  Some people in ETS did observe the problem, but because of the information the Resolution Center shared with us in the morning, our users were not greatly affected.
the IIS services were stopped and restarted on the server that supports access to the Flow Gas application.  We currently have no information about the root cause of the problem.

Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was mentioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled.  I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; when I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had been canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the system when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stating that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price, what happened to the float?

I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as they see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reported and clarified.

Thanks in advance!

Enron Credit Line -2: Secured By Northern Natural Gas

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Co. (ENE) closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines and said it is in active discussions to restructure its debt to improve liquidity. 
In a press release Wednesday, Enron said the $450 million credit facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co. 
A $550 million credit facility, secured by the assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co., closed Nov. 16. The proceeds are being used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. 
The company said the maturity on its $690 million note payable obligation will be extended to mid-December. 
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 



The Death Of A Pipedream
Pamela Williams

Some of the biggest names in Washington have been long associated with the dream of opening up the rich energy fields to rival Gulf oil. But the war in Afghanistan has killed off one of the most ambitious projects. 
The web site of the US oil giant, Unocal, tells a tale of corporate power in hiding. It is a blunt statement of repudiation, far from the covetous plans of the 1990s for crossing Afghanistan with pipelines rich with oil and gas. 
Instead, in an admission of defeat, the company has posted the message: ``Unocal does not have nor do we plan to have any projects in Afghanistan. We do not support the Taliban in any way whatsoever.'' 
Hailed as the biggest single economic event of the 21st century with more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia's fabled reserves the project was a multi-billion dollar pipeline, bringing gas from the prime Turkmenistan reserves, across Afghanistan, to the huge Indian and Pakistan markets. Another pipeline would have carried oil from the Caspian reserves. 
But in 1998, the project faced defeat as the civil rights and feminist lobby in the United States took on the oil giants over the suppression of human rights by the fervent Islamic clerics and mullahs of the Taliban. They wrested the attention of the United Nations and forced the hand of then president Bill Clinton. Notwithstanding years of pressure by Unocal and its star-studded array of consultants, Clinton declared that the Taliban's repression of women's rights meant there could be no recognition of the Government in Kabul. 
It was a bitter blow for Unocal. 
But now, with the Taliban steadily being blasted from power, there is renewed speculation that Unocal might seek to breathe new life into the project, bringing a new frenzy of lobbyists and consultants from the US oil industry into the broken Afghan capital. 
Absolutely not, according to Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane. He rejects outright the suggestion that Unocal never gave up the pipeline dream, and pressured new President George W. Bush to re-open the door to the Taliban earlier this year. 
``Why would we want to go back in there,'' Lane demands. ``In the intervening three years since we pulled out, our company has refocused its interests.'' 
Furthermore, he insists that Unocal never cut deals with the Taliban in the first place. He is keen to paint the company (which is a major donor to the Republican Party), as having moved on to greener pastures. 
``It [the Afghanistan pipeline proposal], had all the earmarks of a very good project. But there was no recognised government and therefore you could not get finance, so the project could not go forward,'' Lane says. ``And we were always an advocate on women's rights and we pressured them [the Taliban] at the time,'' he insists. That's not the way the very influential US lobby group The Feminist Majority remembers it. This organisation rallied women and trade unions across America, and galvanised Hollywood to rally for Afghan women's rights. In the end, the Clintons buckled. 
Spokeswoman for The Feminist Majority, Kathy Spillar, says: ``The whole world was willing to look the other way as this Taliban regime stripped women of every human right except to breathe, while it planned on how to exploit these oil interests. Now the eyes of the world are on what this new government will look like. And we're going to be watching the oil interests closely. There are just too many times these brutal regimes have flourished while business interests look the other way.'' 
The speculation about the continued pressure by oil companies on US foreign policy in Afghanistan has been fed by the publication of a new book which alleges that the oil giants stayed George W's hand on investigating terrorism this year while they tried one last round of diplomacy to secure some concessions from the Taliban. 
In Bin Laden: the Forbidden Truth, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, the authors claim that under pressure from US oil companies, George W. Bush's Administration blocked intelligence agencies from investigating terrorism while it bargained with the Taliban to give up Osama bin Laden in exchange for political recognition and economic aid. 
The authors claim that US oil companies and the US relationship with oil-rich Saudi Arabia were the two greatest obstacles to hunting Islamic terrorists. And they assert that until August this year, the US goal was actually to consolidate the Taliban in the hope of finally striking the lucrative pipeline deals. 
According to the book, the US re-opened negotiations with Taliban representatives in February this year meetings that continued until August, just a month before New York's World Trade Center was attacked. 
The authors claim as their source for this extraordinary revelation, the former deputy director of the FBI, John O'Neill, who for many years led the FBI investigations into Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. 
They say that O'Neill this year complained bitterly that his investigations into bin Laden were blocked by the State Department and the oil lobby connected to President George W Bush. In frustration, O'Neill resigned from the FBI. In a chilling turn of events, he took a new job as head of security at the World Trade Center. He was killed on September 11 in the attack on the twin towers. 
Certainly the top layers of George W. Bush's Administration enjoy excellent relations with the American oil giants. Aside from the Bush family's oil background, Vice-President Dick Cheney was until last year the chief executive of energy services giant, Halliburton; the National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was a director of Chevron through the 1990s, and the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, Donald Evans and Spencer Abraham, worked for oil company Tom Brown. And Unocal includes on its board of directors, Donald Rice, who was Secretary of the Air Force under the first president Bush. 
In its efforts to secure a pipeline deal with the Taliban in recent years, Unocal went to extraordinary lengths. 
With consultants on board such as the former US Ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, the company pursued all opportunities, including donating nearly $US1million to the University of Nebraska to the school of Afghanistan Studies. The money was used in part to set up training programs for Afghans who would work on the pipeline, should Unocal end up in the box seat with the Taliban. 
Taliban mullahs visited the US twice, with representatives travelling to Houston in late 1997 as the guests of Unocal, visiting the home of Unocal boss Marty Miller, enjoying the sights, with trips to the zoo and shopping centres. On the side there were talks with the State Department. 
All the while, intense fighting raged across Afghanistan between the warlords and the Taliban and amongst the warlords themselves. 
The CentGas project, as the Unocal consortium (with its major partner the Saudi company Delta Oil), was known, had to raise its funds by late 1997 to meet its deadlines. But the fighting made it impossible to envision stability and finally the CentGas consortium began to unravel. 
The stakes for the oil giant were huge. In February 1998, Unocal's vice-president of international relations, John Maresca, testified before the House Committee on International Relations. Maresca too, was from the family fold, having been George Bush Snr's Ambassador to Cyprus. 
He outlined the glittering prospects if only the centre could be made to hold in Afghanistan. Despite two decades of bitter warfare and the suppression of human rights, Afghanistan was still the best option for Unocals' pipelines as far as the company was concerned. 
``The route through Afghanistan is the one that would bring Central Asian oil closest to Asian markets and thus would be cheapest in terms of transporting the oil,'' Maresca said. 
And to bring gas, there was the CentGas pipeline. 
But as with the oil pipeline, construction could not begin ``until an internationally recognised Afghanistan government was in place. For the project to advance, it must have international financing, government-to-government agreements and government-to-consortium agreements.'' 
Four weeks later, Bill Clinton, with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by his side, dispatched Unocal's hopes, declaring there would be no diplomatic recognition for the Taliban. 
In his best-selling book, Taliban, Ahmed Rashid, quoted Yasushi Akashi, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs speaking in 1996: ``The outside interference in Afghanistan is now all related to the battle for oil and gas pipelines. The fear is that these companies and regional powers are just renting the Taliban for their own purposes.'' 
The Taliban may now be all but gone, but the oil and gas reserves in the region mean that Afghanistan has by no means reached the end of its long march with the US oil giants. 



Pipeline projects flourish

Tulsa-based Williams Cos. Inc., El Paso Corp. and other domestic energy firms are leading a $2 billion-a-year expansion of natural- gas pipelines in the United States, the biggest since the 1960s. 
Spurred by a projected 30 percent rise in demand for gas in the next nine years, pipeline companies are building projects that will snake their way from the Great Plains to California, and from Canada to New York. 
Falling gas prices and a weakening economy haven't slowed construction. El Paso recently said it plans to spend as much as $1.8 billion on a 750-mile line to bring gas to New York from Nova Scotia, and Duke Energy Corp. announced a $478.1 million expansion of a Canadian line to Boston. 
"We're looking through the short-term cycle," said Stephen Beasley, president of El Paso's Tennessee Gas Pipeline unit. "We're in a transition from a petroleum to a natural-gas economy. If you're building a new boiler, a new home, a new power plant, the principal fuel is natural gas." 
Houston-based El Paso owns 58,000 miles of interstate pipeline, the biggest U.S. network. 
Since 1997, federal regulators have granted construction certificates for 60 onshore and offshore projects that would add 8,110 miles of pipeline with the capacity to move an extra 23.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day. The projects are valued at $10.7 billion. 
There are 24 additional projects, worth $4.4 billion, awaiting federal approval for an additional 8 billion cubic feet of capacity and 1,730 miles of pipeline. 
This year, about 17 pipeline projects are scheduled for completion, adding 5.5 billion cubic feet in daily capacity and 1,400 miles of new or upgraded pipeline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
The construction involves pipelines to new gas reserves, lines to new markets and line expansion to new customers, Beasley said. 
The United States has 185,0000 miles of interstate pipelines and 75,000 miles of distribution pipelines. The system can move about 22 trillion cubic feet of gas daily. 
Forecasts by the Interstate Natural Gas Association and DOE put 2010 demand close to 30 trillion cubic feet. 
Pipeline companies sell line capacity to gas users before starting construction, so the fall in gas prices this year isn't expected to halt construction. 
"These aren't the types of projects you do on speculation," said Cuba Wadlington, head of pipeline operations for Williams. "We aren't selling gas -- we're selling capacity." 
Williams, also one of the biggest energy traders, has a 27,300- mile pipeline network that spans North America. Its biggest project is a $1.6 billion joint venture with Duke Energy for a line from Alabama to Florida. The pipeline will run 700 miles and carry 1 billion cubic feet of gas. 
The company also is working on a $135 million expansion of its Kern River pipeline to California, and is spending $300 million to build a line to the Pacific Northwest from central Wyoming. 
Williams plans to spend an additional $6 billion in the next three years on pipeline projects, Wadlington said. The company also is part of a group that announced recently it will draw up a plan to build a pipeline for bringing Alaskan natural gas to markets in the "lower 48" states. 
The group expects to present a plan to the owners of Alaska's gas reserves and the state by the end of the year to build and run the line by 2008. 
Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., a venture of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy Inc., owns the right of way to the route.

N Amer Oil, Gas Industry On High Alert After FBI Warning

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON (AP)--The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said Monday. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines. 
There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the U.S. and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90% of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions. 
The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 
"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said the memo, adding that the information was "from a source of undetermined reliability." 
The FBI warning continued that "such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed." 
Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan. 
There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America, making protection of such lines difficult. Aerial monitoring of pipelines have increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations, according to industry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.



Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Houston attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated. 
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus "give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest," Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

MOU Signed for 1,700-mile Alaskan Gas Pipeline Project

11/26/2001 
Gas Processors Report 
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 
A memorandum of understanding has been signed between subsidiaries of six U.S. companies and three Canadian firms to immediately begin developing a proposal to build a 1,700- mile natural gas pipeline being designed to transport Alaskan natural gas from the North Slope to Canada and the lower 48 by 2008. The companies are hoping to present a proposal to producers by year-end. If and when an agreement is reached with the producers, the companies will move forward with the Alaskan portion of the project. 
The U.S. companies involved in the project include Williams, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy International, Enron, PG&E Corp., El Paso Corp., while TransCanada PipeLines, Westcoast Energy and Foothills Pipe Lines represent the Canadian parties. The signing of the MOU is significant because it shows a renewed interest in eliminating the historic and other commercial roadblocks to building the project, according to our source. 
All of the companies are the original partners in the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., which was designed by the President and U.S. Congress to build and operate the Alaskan portion of the project in 1977. The companies dropped out of the project years ago, even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already received approval for the project. Numerous other federal permits for the construction and operation of the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) are already in place. The statutory framework for the project provides for a quick approval of the remaining permits needed before construction can begin. 
"This is a big step forward in bringing Alaska's natural gas to markets in the Lower 48, said Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski. "I always have believed that construction of an Alaskan gas transportation system to the Lower 48 is going to take the synergistic efforts of pipeline companies and the oil and gas production companies in cooperation with the State, the federal government and Canada. While this does not guarantee construction of a North Slope gas delivery system, it is a big step in the right direction." 



Wall Street - Oil, oil, boil and trouble.

11/24/2001 
Financial Times - FT.com

A short week on Wall Street appeared a very long week for the energy sector, an industry that has - in everything from oil to electricity - succeeded in delivering some stinging surprises to the US economy this year. 
Last Sunday, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum jolted merger and acquisition specialists out of their torpor with the year's biggest deal, a $35bn "merger of equals" to create the third-largest integrated energy company in the US and the sixth-largest in the world. 
Coincidentally, on Monday, ChevronTexaco feted the consummation of its merger with a New York analysts' meeting at which David O'Reilly, the combined group's chief executive, promised higher than expected annual savings of $1.8bn by 2003. 
Whether the sector needs another clumsy baptism - the fruit of Sunday's announcement will, inevitably, be saddled with the name ConocoPhillips - is not really at issue. Consolidation that began in the 1990s has left medium-sized energy companies such as Conoco and Phillips with little option but to combine resources for exploration and production in order to compete with "super-majors" such as ExxonMobil. 
Volatile oil prices - another story of the week - appear to add to the urgency of the combination, although James Mulva, Phillips's chairman and chief executive, denied that was a prime reason for consolidation. After all, the industry has learned to live with volatility. 
These are companies that, in just three years, have shrugged off concerns about what would happen if crude oil remained at $10 a barrel, and, at the other extreme, the possibility of crude lingering above $30. 
In the short term, the fate of stock prices in the sector may depend on Opec's ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in its confrontation with Norway and, in particular, Russia over calls for a cut in oil output to underpin the world price. Oil stocks, as measured by the Philadelphia Oil Service index, have had a turbulent time since September 11, plummeting initially only to rally back to their levels before the terrorist attacks and then slump again as the wrangling between Opec and non-Opec oil producers burst into the open. 
ChevronTexaco, for one, seemed unperturbed by the stand-off. "If you want a stable price environment, you don't want to be in this business," O'Reilly said on Monday. He was talking about the oil price but he might just as easily have been referring to energy stocks. 
Energy-related industries - from utilities to pipelines - make up six of the 10 worst-performing sectors over the past month, according to Dow Jones data analysed by CBS Marketwatch. 
None, however, has fallen as precipitously or as publicly as Enron, the energy trading company. Its share price at the close on Wednesday was $5.01, down 44 per cent on the week and 94 per cent below its 52-week high of nearly $85. Remember that this was a company that outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index even as the technology-heavy index rose to its March 2000 peak. 
In addition, Enron remained at stratospheric price and valuation levels even after the dotcoms, whose magic dust its online trading operations borrowed, fell to earth. 
In the process, its ability to pioneer new trading markets, such as bandwidth, made it the envy of Wall Street's own broker-dealers, jealous of its trading bravado and its share rating. 
Two of Wall Street's giants - JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup - are now helping to prop up the group, laid low by its failure to disclose adequately off-balance-sheet transactions that it carried out as part of its rapid expansion. The two banks are advising Enron on a rescue bid from Dynegy, the much smaller rival energy group part-owned by ChevronTexaco, and backing it with $1bn of credit, secured on pipeline assets. 
The trigger for this week's sharp decline was Enron's regulatory filing late on Monday, which revealed for the first time to shaken shareholders and bondholders that the group would have to repay $690m of notes next Tuesday because of a downgrade 10 days ago by Standard & Poor's. 
Wednesday's announcement that Enron had managed to postpone that deadline until the middle of next month seemed to do little to allay the crisis of confidence about the group's ability to repay its heavy debts. Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, few share traders seemed to want to hold the stock, which fell 28 per cent on Wednesday alone, and electricity and gas counterparties are also wary of entering long-term contracts in the markets that Enron helped pioneer. 
The Enron debacle is a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change. Earlier this year, the well-connected and politically influential Houston-based group was powerful enough to be accused by Californians of playing a key role in provoking the electricity crisis on the west coast. 
Now Enron's shares and bonds are trading as though it may go bust. If it does, it could drag down other, weaker energy companies, because of its role as a market-maker, supplying liquidity to the power and gas markets. If the worst fears of some Wall Street bankers are realised there may even be repercussions for the wider financial markets, where Enron lays off the risk of price fluctuations, using derivatives.

Volatility Fell Slightly in Light Holiday Trading
As Enron Calls, Lilly Puts Attracted Interest
By Cheryl Winokur Munk

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football. 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79. 
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism. 
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks. 
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note. 
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74. 
Elsewhere in the options market: 
Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, continued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls. 
More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded. 
More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex. 
Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Friday, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become too expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potential blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.25 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume. 



War is the variable in the oil equation.
By IAN BREMNER.

Oil prices are in the news again. Over the past two months, competition for market share and the threat of global recession have caused oil prices to plummet. Investors have regarded this as a positive development, since low energy prices can help resuscitate struggling western economies. 
However, the markets may be pricing the wrong end of the equation, for it is supply, not demand, that may prove a shock to the system. 
At issue is risk in the Middle East. As the war against terrorism moves beyond the Taliban, the US-led coalition will turn elsewhere to root out supporters of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks. The top suspects are Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq - oil exporters with 45 per cent of the world's reserves among them. 
Pressure on these regimes to change their position on terrorism will mount in the coming months. But with the present governments in place, none is likely to do so. The Saudis and Iranians are unable, the Iraqis unwilling. 
While Saudi Arabia has been a military and economic ally of the US, its business and religious leaders have long supported the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Full co-operation with the investigations of September 11 and severance of the financial networks that supported it would critically expose the ruling family. 
Meanwhile, domestic opinion in Saudi Arabia runs counter to the interests of the US-led coalition. For Crown Prince Abdullah to maintain authority, he must take a far more radical stance against the US. Signs of Saudi intransigence have grown accordingly. Prince Abdullah stated that the US and Saudi Arabia should recognise and pursue their separate interests, and stepped up criticism of US policy on Palestine and Iraq. 
Iran's internal stability is also in doubt. Iran tops the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, through its continued support of Hamas and Hezbollah. President Mohammad Khatami would like to move his country towards the west; privately, his advisers hint that he is prepared to make significant concessions on the terrorism issue. But despite an overwhelming electoral victory for the reformers last June, authority remains in the hands of the Khamenei-led conservatives, who soften their stance at their peril. The political situation in Iran - where soccer riots have led to widespread anti-government demonstrations - leaves little room for compromise. 
Demographics work against both regimes. Rapidly expanding and extremely young populations have led to high unemployment and drastically diminished per capita income. Oil prices in the teens could not come at a worse time, guaranteeing crippling budget deficits and cutbacks on stretched social services. Together with pressure from the west, the position of both regimes is increasingly untenable. 
Saddam Hussein, Iraq's president, has little concern for domestic instability. But reports of Iraqi intelligence connections to the September 11 terrorists, coupled with Mr Saddam's alleged development of biological and chemical weapons, make it hard for the US to avoid escalation. President George W. Bush does not yet subscribe to the view of many in the defence department that Iraq should be the US's next military target, but pressure to remove Mr Hussein from power will undoubtedly increase. 
Further stirring the pot, the propaganda war is being lost by the US and the UK. Few in the Middle East feel any sympathy for Mr bin Laden, but the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular. Many are incensed by harm to Iraqi civilians over the issue of sanctions and by US support for Israel. As the war against terrorism moves closer to them, these feelings will intensify, further destabilising isolated regimes. 
The danger is not that Saudi Arabia or their neighbours will stop selling oil to the west on principle: their need for petrodollars is overwhelming. The risk is that one or more key oil producers will face a sudden crisis of government, disrupting the flow of oil. And there are other dangers, such as a terrorist attack on key refineries or pipelines. 
Nevertheless, few economists are seriously discussing the possibility of a jump in oil prices. They remain focused on prospects for recovery in the middle of next year. Significantly higher prices are far from certain, but $40 a barrel for any sustained period would damage or stall any recovery. 
Washington can do little to help. Using its strategic oil reserves is a possibility, as is exploiting new reserves in Alaska. Strategic discussions with Russia to keep supply high and increased flows from the Caspian would also help. 
Either way, a recovery is dependent upon maintaining stability in the Middle East. US fixes are simply nibbling around the edges.

Terror threat puts oil firms on alert-- Letter warns of attacks on installations, pipelines if bin Laden killed or captured

VANCOUVER -- Canada's oil-and-gas sector is on high alert after learning of a threat that associates of Osama bin Laden may be planning to sabotage energy installations and pipelines in North America. 
A spokesman for B.C. Gas Utility Ltd. confirmed yesterday that the company has received a copy of a warning it believes was distributed to about 400 members of the Washington, D.C.-based American Petroleum Institute last week. 
In a confidential letter, the institute said it had received information from a source of "unde- termined reliability" warning that an attack will take place if Mr. bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is either captured are killed. 
The letter contained no details on who issued the warning, how such an attack would be carried out, or which facilities would be targeted. 
B.C. Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said the warning may be the work of a prankster. "But at the same time, when something like this comes out, you can't dismiss it out of hand," he said. 
"Since Sept. 11, we have increased security at our facilities and we are being more vigilant in watching and monitoring our pipelines. I think other oil-and-gas companies are likely doing the same," he said. 
Mr. Pelkey said he believes the confidential warning was sent to other Canadian members of API, which, according to its Web site, include Alberta companies Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada Ltd. 
Contacted yesterday, officials at Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada said they were not aware of the warning. They said their security measures have been stepped up since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Syncrude Canada spokeswoman Cherry Holland said the oil sands company's 3,700 employees have been told to wear personal identification tags at all times. 
A Petro-Canada official said the company has installed fencing and surveillance cameras around its Edmonton refinery. Company employees also need security cards to get in and out of Petro-Canada's office buildings. 
"We are cognizant of the events of Sept. 11, as terrible as they were, and it is certainly accurate to say that we are being very conscious of security measures lately," Petro-Canada spokesman Chris Dawson said. 
News of the warning comes just weeks after oil-patch representatives met with Alberta government officials to talk about security. 
At the meetings Sept. 28, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said the government needs to see an inventory of what oil-and-gas sector projects around the province need increased security. He said government and industry need to co- ordinate their efforts. 
A spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to discuss the API warning. 
"On matters like this we make absolutely no comment other than that all information we received is passed on to federal and provincial authorities," he said. 
About 40 per cent of U.S. oil-supply needs are met by Canadian producers, according to API's Web site. 



Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover 
By Christina Cheddar

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives," said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE). 
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14. 
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to "BBB-" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
  
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock. 
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Oil, gas industry on high alert after FBI warning 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -- The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said today. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines. 
There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the United States and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions. 
The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 
"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said the memo, adding that the information was "from a source of undetermined reliability." 
The FBI warning continued that "such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed." 
Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan. 
Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.

Greg,

I have been told that for system load purposes, NNG's procedure is to limit the number to two.  Obviously, someone overrode the procedure when they set up three email addresses.  They still recommend that this be limited to two.  If it is not too much trouble, they would prefer to have an email address that provides for multiple distribution internally to VEPCO.  Let me know if this is a problem.


Thanks & sorry for the confusion.
Vernon

Vernon:
I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email
list.  I will start working on the internal email list, but can you confirm we
can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the
attention.

Greg

Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should
try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what
that address is and we'll get you set up.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

Crude Oil Futures Slip in Profit-Taking


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped
$0.37 to $20.90 per barrel yesterday, but remained near 6-week highs.
Traders attributed the losses to some profit-taking after crude
prices climbed by $1.65 per barrel on Wednesday. Speculation that
OPEC members will keep pumping over their quotas also pressured the
market downward. OPEC is expected to announce its 4th production cut
in a year today. It is expected to cut output by 1.5 million bpd
after receiving pledges from non-member producing countries to lower
exports by a combined total of 462,500 bpd. However, the 10 OPEC
members with quotas exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in
November. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and non-
members will be closer to 1.0  1.2 million bpd, which could be enough
to prevent crude oil inventories from rising. The production cuts are
aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPEC's
basket of crudes. The IEA has forecast that world oil demand will
rise next year by 600,000 bpd, about 30% below the demand growth rate
over the last decade. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the
NYMEX fell $0.0131 to $0.5815 per gallon. January gasoline futures on
the NYMEX dipped $0.0086 to $0.5927 per gallon. In London, Brent
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were up $1.01 to
$20.34 per barrel.

Canadian Oil Stocks Surge


    Canadian oil stocks surged yesterday morning as investors
welcomed apparent confirmation that OPEC would make its much
predicted production cut today. The Toronto Stock Exchange oil and
natural gas sub-index was up 1.89% at 9,047.34 just before noon. The
jump followed Saudi Arabia's oil minister's statement that OPEC would
announce a production cut of 1.5 million bpd. The Canadian markets
were closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the Christmas holiday. The
TSE's energy group topped the 9,000 level for the first time in more
than a month. Non-OPEC exporters Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and
Angola have together agreed to cut crude exports by 462,500 bpd.

Fitch Places Express Pipeline on Rating Watch Negative


    Fitch has placed the `A' rating of the $150 million 6.47% senior
secured notes and the `BBB' rating of the $250 million 7.39%
subordinated secured notes issued by Express Pipeline on Rating Watch
Negative. The action reflects the weakened fundamentals of the US
energy market and the resulting impact on the overall credit quality
of the crude shippers. In addition, the financial performance of
Express has been below original projections due to weakened demand in
its targeted regional markets. The Express notes were issued in
February 1998 to finance the construction of the Express Pipeline and
to repay the costs incurred in the acquisition and upgrading of the
Platte pipeline. The ability of Express to service its debt is
largely dependent upon the revenues received from the pipeline
transportation tariffs paid by various crude shippers under
contractual off-take arrangements. Express is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Alberta Energy. The Express Pipeline System consists of
two main segments, the Express and Platte pipelines. The Express
segment is 785 miles long beginning in Hardisty, Alberta and running
to Casper, WY. The Platte segment is 932 miles long beginning in
Casper and extending to Wood River, IL.

Nigeria Under Pressure to Comply with New Quotas


   At the OPEC meeting today in Cairo, Nigeria will likely receive
intense pressure to increase compliance with its official OPEC
limits. The cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut 1.5
million bpd from output along with almost 500,000 bpd of reductions
from non-OPEC producers at the meeting. The cartels overall
compliance with its self-imposed limits improved in November as the
10 members were 600,000 bpd over their limits. However, according to
its own data, Nigeria pumped 300,000 bpd in excess of its quota,
making it responsible for half the cheating. If OPEC cuts output by
an expected 1.5 million bpd, Nigeria's new quota would be about 1.79
million bpd, necessitating a 400,000 bpd cut, or 22% from its
November volumes. Nigeria's presidential adviser on energy will
takeover as OPEC President on January 1st, making it even more
important that it adhere to the quota. Some cartel members say that
full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have
asked non-members to make commitments and it is important for OPEC to
stick to set an example. It is unlikely that OPEC members will reach
full compliance during January. Sales commitments for the month have
already been made and although some members like Saudi Arabia have
flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes
already sold.

Russia's Oil Export Plan Leaves Loopholes


    Russia's 1st quarter oil export schedule makes it only appear
that the country will keep a promise to cut 150,000 bpd of exports in
a bid to help OPEC lift sagging crude prices. This week, it set an
export schedule to export 30.9 million tonnes of its own crude and
will ship 3.63 million tonnes of Kazakh and 725,000 tonnes of Azeri
crude in the 1st quarter of next year. Although the schedule looks
like a firm pledge to reduce exports, there is no benchmark figure to
which the schedule could be compared. Russian traders say that the
country's oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the
West because it pays more than domestic consumers. They point out
that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the
state pipeline Transneft, over 2 million tonnes per quarter bypass
Transneft. There are many ways to increase officially declared 1st
quarter volumes, for example, by allowing oil companies to export
cargoes not shipped in November and December due to storms. It is
also possible that Russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to
Ukraine and Belarus refineries, where their further shipments will be
hard to track.

OPEC Expected to Announce Production Cut Today

    OPEC is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to 1.5
million bpd from exports at a meeting in Cairo today. The output cut
is expected to be effective as of January 1st and last 3-6 months and
is aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPECs
basket of crudes. But some members of the cartel appear to be bowing
to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying
that they believe $20 to $22 is a reasonable level and that $25 is
not a reasonable price. The demand for oil is growing at its slowest
pace since 1984, forcing OPEC and non-aligned producers to cut
supplies. The IEA predicts that oil demand will grow by just 600,000
bpd, which is 30% lower than the average growth over the last decade.
However, many think that OPEC will fail because of the cartels poor
record of compliance to previously instituted reductions. OPEC
members exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in November.
If OPEC does not stick to its self-imposed limits, there is very
little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their
commitments. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and
non-members will be closer to between 1 million and 1.2 million bpd,
which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising.

Jo Williams left me a message this morning requesting that during the morning gas control meeting that when allocations are announced that the shippers that were cut be given without Marketing asking for the information.
 I had this information this morning but no one asked for it. 
I told Jo someone had been coming to the meetings with that information available and it had been given out when asked for but she failed to remember that. I guess we should just announce who got cut when we talk about the allocations and if it gets to be too much information Marketing will let us know.

It appears that Shelley will not be flying back to the states until January 4th.  It doesn't look like she will be celebrating New Year's eve in Texas, but, I'm sure it will be one that she will remember for the rest of her life...

Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks and have a great holiday!

PLE has been updated to reflect a new SAP Number for ENA Upstream.  

The new number is 1000000303 and reflects ENA Upstream as an inter-company entry.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Lynn, we had a conference call with Kelly and Jeff yesterday. Chris was on the call also. We got nowhere, so then Kent and Steve Kirk called them later and explained how the process works and that we can't "reserve" capacity for them. They hung up on Steve and Kent. Shelley has been brought up to speed. thanks. sj

Subject: Storage Allocations

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
"The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market," FERC said in its draft order. "Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate." 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, "given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California." 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was "extremely successful," adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
"The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States," said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
"We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region," said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
"Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. "We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

Lynn - Below is a list of people that Courtney Barker(in Marketing) sends a couple of reports on daily index prices to every month.   Courtney is now posting these reports on the Marketing Dashboard.   Would you like to give your employees below access to the Dashboard or does Courtney need to continue sending the reports via E:Mail?    Please advise us and we will be glad to follow through.   Thanks so much!  Martha

Courtney - Clarification on .... (They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?)      Are you referring to people in Market Services and if so, what level are they?  Martha

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker

Lynn,
The meeting is set up for Monday the 29th. If you want me to change it to the 30th I can or I can go alone, remember I am out starting the 31st. Ava did not tell me you had Jury duty until after the flight had been booked.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the "macro" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

There were no allocations for NNG for the gas day of 12/26, therefore the there is no information to display for allocations.  Before relaying this information on to the group, please check with Gary Spraggins, Darrell Schoolcraft, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan to verify there were no allocations on the pipes.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155
higher Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for
continued cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest
had locals scurrying to cover their short positions. The March
contract gained $0.123 to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying
started early in the session, a reaction in part to Thursday's
liquidation on the January contract expiration. Clearing the books of
Enron-related hedging losers in time for year-end could also be
playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the volatility over the
past month has been triggered by larger books balancing their hedges.
Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to recontract supplies,
pushing the market with offers or with bids. Shuffling monthly
spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought at higher
prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop mid-
January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals.
The AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data
until Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this
winter, many traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this
week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have
began flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven
this year by the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this
year's filings to try to make sure other companies don't go the same
way as Enron. What is new this year is the auditor independence
proposals. Pension funds affiliated with the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals calling on companies not to
hire the same accounting firm to do both audit and non-audit work.
Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both audit and non-audit
services, a dual relationship that has raised questions about
Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual flood that
hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be included
in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In
2001 the SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to
exclude shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle
charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before
the state opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at
offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related
regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas
prices soared a year ago, the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas
utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because
of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state.
Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to
operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is approved by the PUC,
TXU will return $350 million to retail electric suppliers over 2
years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates.
TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million in the 4th
quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would eliminate
any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear
station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to
the utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements
approved by the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to
$90 per customer from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains
more than 60% of its customers after the first 2 years of
competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity

    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind
facility in Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain
Windpower. The project will include about 42 wind turbines, each
producing about 1.5 MW. The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest
wind turbine technology and will be the largest commercial wind
energy facility in the eastern US. The project is expected to be
operational by December 2002. It will interconnect with the Allegheny
Power System in the PJM West RTO and will be integrated with the PJM
RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed 20-year purchase agreements
for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project, 15 MW from the Mill
Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain Wind Farm near
Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio to 144
MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community
Energy and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind
projects. Large commercial customers, such as the University of
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University,
Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have
already purchased wind energy from Power Team and Community Energy
for periods from 15 years. Power Team's current renewable supply
portfolio includes wind, landfill gas, hydroelectric, and biomass
generation.

FERC Order Sets Direction in Midwest

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the
vehicle for a single, regional transmission organization in the
Midwest is an important decision.  It will spark the development of a
competitive regional power market in the Midwest, of particular
importance to energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a
customer coalition active in the federal arena. The Coalition of
Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio,
stated that FERC's decision paves the way for actual implementation
of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest
transmission grid, that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba,
Canada, up and running. The coordination so critical to system
reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now proceed on a
timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of
problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue
with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional
marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also
Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide
marketplace. The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance
RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out
in FERC's Order 2000. The Commission made plain that the Alliance
companies could continue with the formation of the for-profit
Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella. The significance of
this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single
organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of market
participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and
competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November
20th orders preventing several utilities from using their market-
pricing authority in areas where they have market power is as
critical to nurturing an effective market as the order for a single
Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from
Whitehorse, Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural
gas drilling. By utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its
reverse circulation center sampling technology to shallow low-
pressure gas drilling, the resulting formation damage is virtually
eliminated. The air circulates down between the inner and outer drill
pipe, drives the air hammer, and reverse circulates the rock cuttings
back up to surface. This virtually eliminates drilling damage to the
formation.

Hello:  We still need walkers to meet our deadline on line walking before the end of the year.  If you have people who can make themselve available please contact me or Gragg Pape so we can coordinate your efforts.  Some items that will help if you have them available are: GPS units, high wattage walkie talkies, ATV and personal gear suitable for rough country -- blaze orange vests are a plus even though deer season ends this Sunday.

I have comittments from Tony Gomez and Ken Gordon -- you're both starting on the 26?  Hotel arrangements are best in Stillwater -- major chains available there.

What is involved in the walking process?   Walkers will record any possible problem on the pipeline recording it on a pad and collecting a GPS reading at the site, these could include weeping collars, dents in exposed pipeline, missing line markers and any other anomaly which could affect the performance or integrity of the pipeline or could result in future problems such as encroachments.

This is a very important initiative as referenced in Randy's email date 11/6/01.

Delynn is checking on a tracking number and if time can be charged to EOTT, I have no knowledge of the status.


Thanks in adavance!

John

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  

I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Just wanted to reinterate to everyone especially those that may not be here today, I have put on your monitors the procedures that we will use next Tuesday, December 11 regarding the collection of the money for the Reservation and Commodity invoices.  We will be giving you a list Tuesday morning that will show all of the shippers that we sent invoices to on December 3.  Do not call them until we get that list to you.  We would like for you to highlight the shippers that you have called and then return the lists to us.  This will help us to ensure that everyone has been called.

Please note:  If you shipper currently knows our Lock Box number because they send checks, please be sure that you call these folks because we cannot let them use the Lock Box.  They can still send a check in, but they will need to send it to the P.O. Box 1188 for this building.  If possible, give them your room location so that it can come directly to you.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks,

Richard, Larry and Raetta

As you are aware, the Corporate American Express credit cards have been cancelled, effective December 4, 2001.  We are working with American Express to establish new contracts for ETS employees. This will allow for reinstatement of service and a requirement for issuance of new cards.  We are expecting an answer from American Express on December 14, 2001.

Until advised, please limit travel and entertainment expenses.  If you are required to travel on business, you will need to use your personal credit cards or cash and submit your expenses through the XMS expense account system at:  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .   If the use of a personal credit card to cover your travel needs is not an option, cash advances can be approved by your immediate supervisor, and processed through your local administrative team.  In Houston, all cash advance requests, after obtaining proper approval, should be routed to Carolyn Centilli for processing. 

We will continue to update you of program changes as we continue to work with American Express.  If you have questions, please call Mary Ann Johnson - 713-345-5278 or Bruce Martin - 713-345-6527.

Charlie,

I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed upon difference.

Subject:	RE: Northern vs. Oneok:  Oneok measurement settlement

Charlie sent me the following message.
"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

Dari,

The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.


Date		Plant PTR		NNG PTR		Difference
9/12/2001	88,335			90,910			2,575
9/13/2001	92,175			95,968			3,793

	Bob, you are correct in your statement.  But I want to be sure Koch understand
	when they nominate their receipt at Carlton of 2828 the delivery on that
	path will be 2828 less fuel.  Otherwise I agree with you statements.  I will
	be out next week, but Raetta is up to speed on this issue if you have any
	questions.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn:  Please verify that if Koch realigns their 35,000/d contract (K# 20510)such that their MDQ at Carlton matches their Carlton flow obligation of 2,828 and has the rest of their 32,172/d at Marshall (They would need to realign 30 mcf from Carlton to Marshall to effectuate the above, and I've checked with Doug Aschwege to make sure he would approve it.) that Steve's and my interpretation as described below is correct.  Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Subject: Receipt Points


Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips

Vernon,
This function is managed in the Contract system so I spoke to Karen Brostad and her answer is 2 persons.

Vernon:
I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email
list.  I will start working on the internal email list, but can you confirm we
can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the
attention.

Greg

Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should
try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what
that address is and we'll get you set up.

Thanks!

We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if
you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a
couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many
people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that
would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the "macro" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called "critical notices" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.   

I do think we need to know the following:  

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?    
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?  

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Several of your cost centers have non-payroll costs trailing payroll to work orders.  In order to maintain the integrity of the true capital costs, time coded outside your home cost center must be recorded to a FAR order or specific project, not a cost center.  Please remind your timekeepers or anyone responible for coding timesheets.

Thank you,

Please pass on to all teams who were planning to meet at the Beaver Plant, Spearman Plant, Oklahoma City, and Duncan offices with Phil Lowry and party this week that the field trip has been cancelled.   If it is rescheduled, it will probably be moved to December or January.

Sorry for the short notice, but Phil has been asked to meet with Dynegy on Thursday to give a presentation on ETS pipeline operations.  I would interpret that to be good news that Dynegy is still showing interest in our pipeline group.

Lynn,

Do you know what time you are going to meet with the TW team tomorrow?
Since the Team Leader meeting has been canceled, I would like to plan on being there when you meet with the team.
Would you please let me know.

Thanks,
Beverly

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "=
accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a=
dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months."=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation=
 liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=
ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=
gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of Enron shall =
have become untrue."=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=
ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=
peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=
ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its "duty of good fai=
th and fair dealing" and said the New Mexico company tried to "sabotage" th=
e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=
he accusations.

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to r=
ecover from too much turkey and football.=20
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which=
 measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge invest=
or sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading sess=
ion the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money =
managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor=
 optimism.=20
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid=
 victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Fe=
deral Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for sev=
eral weeks following the attacks.=20
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strat=
egy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving =
and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in impl=
ied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets o=
utside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. To=
ikka wrote in a recent research note.=20
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the t=
echnology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Na=
sdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.=20
Elsewhere in the options market:=20
Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, con=
tinued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls an=
d simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls.=20
More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open inte=
rest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost=
 $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded.=
=20
More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open int=
erest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex.=20
Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Frida=
y, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rati=
ng on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become t=
oo expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potenti=
al blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000=
 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.2=
5 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume.

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with s=

By Stephanie Anderson Forest, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and Peter Coy a=

11/26/2001

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=
sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=
 ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =
at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=
ident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year-=
-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his=
 bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for=
 good.

Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die

c. 2001 New York Times Company=20
Officials of Dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the te=
rms of the company's agreement to acquire Enron, its Houston rival, while E=
nron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances, executives close to t=
he two companies said.=20
The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register =
doubts about the financial stability of Enron, the energy trading concern. =
Enron's stock fell another 27 percent, even though the company won a three-=
week reprieve from its banks on a $690 million note that would have come du=
e next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral.=20
An executive close to Enron described the loan extension, by J. P. Morgan C=
hase and Citigroup, as a Band-Aid, given the approach of Thanksgiving. ''Pe=
ople are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermed=
iate term,'' the executive added.=20
The bankers also met with investors, including leveraged buyout firms and t=
wo industrial companies, which might inject up to $2 billion into Enron und=
er arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the comp=
any's stock, the executives said.=20
The new investments would be in Enron's Transwestern Pipeline, which links =
natural gas fields in Texas to the California market, they said. The deals =
would be structured like Dynegy's agreement, as part of the merger, to infu=
se $1.5 billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Ga=
s pipeline. That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merg=
er falls apart.=20
Besides talking with other potential investors, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citi=
group agreed to terms that have each taking a $250 million equity stake in =
such a deal, the executives said. The bankers plan to meet with Enron offic=
ials on Monday to complete the transactions, they added.=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company had previously sa=
id it was seeking a further infusion of up to $1 billion in equity. ''We ar=
e not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to,'' she said.=
=20
Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron, which is down 94 perc=
ent this year, the banks, Dynegy and credit-rating agencies all sought to p=
roceed delicately. Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen =
the crisis of confidence in Enron, wiping out the energy trading operations=
 that only months ago made it one of the nation's most admired and politica=
lly influential companies.=20
Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating th=
e merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other en=
ergy traders.=20
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal=
 grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dyn=
egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed=
. But he indicated that the situation could change.=20
Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that she was not aware of any attemp=
ts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal. Dynegy issued a statement saying that=
 its chief executive, Chuck Watson, was encouraged by the steps Enron had t=
aken with its bankers. Mr. Watson said the company was continuing its due d=
iligence on the deal.=20
Dynegy's shares, which rose as high as $46.94 in the days after the merger =
was announced, on Nov. 9, closed yesterday at $39.76, down more than 4 perc=
ent for the second consecutive day.=20
Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, cl=
osing at $5.01, down $1.98. That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay=
ing for Enron has risen to 115 percent.=20
Analysts following Enron's debt said that bankers had little choice but to =
support the company, given that most of Enron's bank debt is not secured. T=
hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy, they would receive =
no better treatment than the holders of more than $6 billion in Enron bonds=
 and other debt.=20
Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $9.15 billion in deb=
t that will come due by the end of 2002. ''If the Dynegy deal closed, that =
would be the best thing for the banks,'' said one analyst following the deb=
t.=20
James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, echoed that thought =
in a statement issued by Enron. ''We believe the interests of Chase and Enr=
on's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' he s=
aid. ''We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a p=
lan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger w=
ith Dynegy.'' Along with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase is Enron's lead bank=
, and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy.=20
Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink, the big credit-rat=
ing agencies, continued to step gingerly. The agencies have held Enron's de=
bt rating one step above ''junk'' status, knowing that downgrading it furth=
er would force the company to pay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt -=
- effectively rendering Enron insolvent. One rating agency official said ye=
sterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market, adding that it =
was ''patriotic'' to hold off.=20
Still, one rating agency, Fitch, put out a strongly worded commentary yeste=
rday.=20
''If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation s=
eems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,'' wrote Ralph Pel=
lecchia and Glen Grabelsky, the Fitch analysts following Enron. ''Our prese=
nt BBB- rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the=
 lending banks, without which Fitch would consider lowering the rating.''=
=20
Analysts and energy executives said that Enron's collapse -- though unthink=
able just weeks ago -- would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation'=
s energy markets. While Enron has been the nation's biggest trader of elect=
ric power and natural gas, many other companies -- including Dynegy -- make=
 markets in those commodities. Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron'=
s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind de=
als and limit their exposure to Enron.=20
Yet even one of Enron's most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yest=
erday that his confidence had been shattered by the company's problems, inc=
luding the rapid depletion of its cash reserves, restatements that erased $=
600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $690 million deb=
t.=20
That fan, Goldman, Sachs & Company's energy analyst, David Fleischer, downg=
raded the shares to neutral. Until yesterday, Goldman had kept the stock on=
 its recommended list.

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi=
s is still the time to invest."=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. "We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=

 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, "remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=

 months," the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=

 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

Deal still on as Enron shares drop 6%=20

Shares of Enron dropped another 6 percent Friday, as the investment communi=
ty fretted that the acquisition price for the company by Dynegy may be redu=

The two sides didn't offer anything new for worried investors.=20
Dynegy stuck to its Wednesday statement that it is working to accelerate re=
gulatory approvals in order to complete the deal as previously announced.=
=20
Dynegy is continuing to take a close look at Enron as part of the due dilig=
ence process, which will involve careful study of Enron 's books, Dynegy sp=
okesman John Sousa said on Friday.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was encouraged th=
at Enron had closed a $450 million credit security and received an extensio=
n on a $690 million IOU.=20
Dynegy remains optimistic that the deal can be done, said a source close to=
 the company.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said she was unaware of any meetings planned =
between top executives of the two companies this weekend, which could signa=
l alterations to the deal.=20
Enron 's stock, which was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange on=
 Friday, dropped 30 cents to close at $4.71 per share.=20
This made it the worst performing stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 index =
for the week, with a loss of 48 percent for the holiday-shortened period.=
=20
It was a bad week for a stock that has come down from a 52-week high of $84=

rcent.=20
More than 40 million shares traded hands Friday. On Wednesday, 116 million =
shares were traded.=20
Analyst Ron Barone of UBS Warburg said the odds of a reduced exchange ratio=
 in the deal were rising.=20
As announced Nov. 9, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 of its shares for each sh=
are of Enron . According to Barone, 0.15 might be more appropriate.=20
Traders also speculated that Enron might need to issue more stock to stabil=

re doing billion-dollar trades with Enron, and nobody quite knows why they =
were doing this. Some people believe it was to enrich the officers in quest=
ion, but other people believe that they were doing this to help smooth out =
their earnings. In other words, it was a form of hyping the stocks to keep =
the earnings going up, and they would take their losses--they'd bundle thei=
r losses and they'd throw them in these partnerships so they wouldn't be on=
 the balance sheet.=20
And when this stuff started to emerge in the newspapers, that's when the wh=
eels really started to fall off, and people were saying, `If this is going =
on, what'--I mean, this his terrible in and of itself--`but what else could=
 there be?' And it turns out there've been other things as well.=20
SIMON: Well, you know, I think I understand why now Enron wants the deal wi=
th Dynegy to go through, but what does Dynegy see in this?=20
NOCERA: Well, Enron still does somewhere 25 and 33 percent of all the natur=
al gas and energy futures trade in the United States. It's a huge marketpla=
ce, and Dynegy is a much smaller and more conservative player and, you know=
, by buying Enron, suddenly they became a much, much bigger player. Also, D=
ynegy actually has hard physical assets and, unlike Enron, they wouldn't ju=
st be a middleman on these trades, they would actually be delivering the na=
tural gas. There is something in it for Dynegy. They're buying a very big c=
ompany at for what now looks like $5 a share. It's really incredible.=20
SIMON: And let me ask about this, finally; some Enron employees--a good num=
ber of Enron employees are suing the company, contending, credibly, that th=
ey've been essentially defrauded out of pension money.=20
NOCERA: Right. Their big gripe is that when the thing started to tank, when=
 the stock started to go down, they were unable to move their--get out of E=
nron stock and their pension fund--that Enron actually throws the stock in =
their fund, so they couldn't move out into a different investment vehicle. =
Now they're saying that, you know, they've been defrauded because the stock=
 was fraudulently hyped. And you know what, Scott? When all is said and don=
e, I think they've got a case. I think they're going to be able to, in fact=
, show that much of what Enron did, the reason they did the things they did=
 was to hype the stock. And this is a classic case of what happens when you=
 put the stock in front of the company instead of the company in front of t=
he stock.=20
SIMON: I hate to ask a question like this with just five seconds left, but =
could there be a criminal investigation?=20
NOCERA: Oh, I think there will be. The SEC is already circling around.=20
SIMON: OK, Joe, thanks very much.=20
NOCERA: Thank you, Scott.=20
SIMON: Joe Nocera, executive editor of Fortune magazine, and speaking with =

Dynegy's Right to Enron Pipeline May Be Disputed, Barron's Says
2001-11-24 13:52 (New York)


     Houston, Nov. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may have a hard
time claiming one of Enron Corp.'s pipelines if their merger
agreement collapses, because the asset has been pledged as
collateral for $1 billion in bank loans, Barron's reported.

     Dynegy has said its initial investment of $1.5 billion in
Enron, using cash from ChevronTexaco Corp., gave Dynegy the right
to acquire Northern Natural Gas Co. if the deal falls through.

     Enron, though, has pledged the assets of its Transwestern and
Northern Natural Gas pipelines to get $1 billion in loans from
J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Dynegy's claim to
the pipeline may be challenged by Enron's lenders if Enron is
forced into bankruptcy, Barron's said.

     Dynegy may also be concerned about Enron affecting its credit
rating, Barron's said. Dynegy, which has a market value of more
than $10 billion and assets worth only $2.5 billion, is listed two
notches above junk status and is on watch for a possible
downgrade, the weekly newspaper said.

     Barron's said renegotiating the purchase in response to a
recent decline in Enron's shares might not make sense because the
company's debt accounts for most of the deal's value, now around
$23 billion.

Accounting Peer Review Gets More Scrutiny

The accounting industry's watchdog group is examining the industry's ''peer=
 review'' process in light of enormous accounting problems at the Enron Cor=
poration.=20
The group, called the Public Oversight Board, will meet next week to consid=
er whether reviews of audits being conducted by accounting firms adequately=
 safeguard the public interest, according to its chairman, Charles Bowsher.=
 The session comes after revelations by Enron that it had overstated earnin=
gs by nearly $600 million over four years and that it had inflated sharehol=
der equity by $1.2 billion because of ''an accounting error.''
Arthur Andersen has been Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, an=
d its work has been submitted periodically to Deloitte & Touche for ''peer =
reviewing.'' One such review is being conducted now.=20
Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said in a letter to Mr. B=
owsher that no Big Five accounting firm had ever issued a negative report a=
fter a peer review. Mr. Bowsher told Bloomberg News that the Oversight Boar=
d would ask: ''How can you have peer reviews and still have these kinds of =
failures?''

An Alternate Reality
By PAUL KRUGMAN

11/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 11, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Most Americans get their news from TV. And what they see is heartwarming --=
 a picture of a nation behaving well in a time of crisis. Indeed, the vast =
majority of Americans have been both resolute and generous.=20
But that's not the whole story, and the images TV doesn't show are anything=
 but heartwarming. A full picture would show politicians and businessmen be=
having badly, with this bad behavior made possible -- and made worse -- by =
the fact that these days selfishness comes tightly wrapped in the flag. If =
you pay attention to the whole picture, you start to feel that you are livi=
ng in a different reality from the one on TV.
The alternate reality isn't deeply hidden. It's available to anyone with a =
modem, and some of it makes it into quality newspapers. Often you can find =
the best reporting on what's really going on in the business section, becau=
se business reporters and commentators are not expected to view the world t=
hrough rose-colored glasses.=20
>From an economist's point of view, the most revealing indicator of what's r=
eally happening is the post-Sept. 11 fondness of politicians for ''lump-sum=
 transfers.'' That's economese for payments that aren't contingent on the r=
ecipient's actions, and which therefore give no incentive for changed behav=
ior. That's good if the transfer is meant to help someone in need, without =
reducing his motivation to work. It's bad if the alleged purpose of the tra=
nsfer is to get the recipient to do something useful, like invest or hire m=
ore workers.=20
So it tells you something when Congress votes $15 billion in aid and loan g=
uarantees for airline companies but not a penny for laid-off airline worker=
s. It tells you even more when the House passes a ''stimulus'' bill that co=
ntains almost nothing for the unemployed but includes $25 billion in retroa=
ctive corporate tax cuts -- that is, pure lump-sum transfers to corporation=
s, most of them highly profitable.=20
Most political reporting about the stimulus debate describes it as a confli=
ct of ideologies. But ideology has nothing to do with it. No economic doctr=
ine I'm aware of, right or left, says that an $800 million lump-sum transfe=
r to General Motors will lead to more investment when the company is alread=
y sitting on $8 billion in cash.=20
As Jonathan Chait points out, there used to be some question about the true=
 motives of people like Dick Armey and Tom DeLay. Did they really believe i=
n free markets, or did they just want to take from the poor and give to the=
 rich? Now we know.=20
Of course, it's not all about lump-sum transfers. Since Sept. 11 there has =
also been a sustained effort, under cover of the national emergency, to ope=
n public lands to oil companies and logging interests. Administration offic=
ials claim that it's all for the sake of national security, but when you di=
scover that they also intend to reverse rules excluding snowmobiles from Ye=
llowstone, the truth becomes clear.=20
So what's the real state of the nation? On TV this looks like World War II.=
 But though our cause is just, for 99.9 percent of Americans this war, wage=
d by a small cadre of highly trained professionals, is a spectator event. A=
nd the home front looks not like wartime but like a postwar aftermath, in w=
hich the normal instincts of a nation at war -- to rally round the flag and=
 place trust in our leaders -- are all too easily exploited.=20
Indeed, current events bear an almost eerie resemblance to the period just =
after World War I. John Ashcroft is re-enacting the Palmer raids, which swe=
pt up thousands of immigrants suspected of radicalism; the vast majority tu=
rned out to be innocent of any wrongdoing, and some turned out to be U.S. c=
itizens. Executives at Enron seem to have been channeling the spirit of Cha=
rles Ponzi. And the push to open public lands to private exploitation sound=
s like Teapot Dome, which also involved oil drilling on public land. Presum=
ably this time there have been no outright bribes, but the giveaways to cor=
porations are actually much larger.=20
What this country needs is a return to normalcy. And I don't mean the selec=
tive normalcy the Bush administration wants, in which everyone goes shoppin=
g but the media continue to report only inspiring stories and war news. It'=
s time to give the American people the whole picture.

MARKET WATCH
Will New York Be Told, Once Again, to Drop Dead?
By ALEX BERENSON

11/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

NEARLY 11 weeks after the worst terrorist attack in history, New York is di=
scovering just how much the rest of the United States cares about the natio=
n's business and financial center.=20
Not much.
Early hopes that the nation would rally to help the city overcome the devas=
tating economic impact of Sept. 11 appear to have been misplaced. Not only =
is Gov. George E. Pataki's ill-advised pitch for $54 billion in federal aid=
 all but dead, apparently the city will struggle to get the $20 billion tha=
t President Bush promised.=20
Yes, many of the city's economic problems are self-inflicted. With a munici=
pal work force of 250,000, New York employs one-seventh as many people as t=
he federal government, excluding the armed forces. To support that bureaucr=
acy, the city has the highest taxes of any local government in America. Dev=
elopment is absurdly difficult, even outside Manhattan. Roads and bridges a=
re a mess.=20
But all of that was true before Sept. 11, and New York somehow made do. In =
fact, a record number of new jobs were created here in 2000, according to S=
teven Malanga, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative pol=
icy group. ''In the last seven or eight years, the city's economy has rebou=
nded in a way that's very encouraging,'' he said.=20
The attacks changed all that. By discouraging people from coming to crowded=
 places like Times Square, terrorism strikes at the heart of New York, said=
 Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York Univ=
ersity. ''New York's economy is built on interaction,'' he said. The indust=
ries that have suffered most severely are New York's most important employe=
rs: tourism, media, advertising and financial services, which was due for c=
uts even before the attacks.=20
Last month, the city lost 79,000 jobs, a record. The slowdown has blown a h=
ole in city and state budgets, which are precariously balanced at the best =
of times. The Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog org=
anization, predicts that the city will face a budget deficit of $4 billion =
next year.=20
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has asked city agencies to cut their budgets by 1=
5 percent. More cuts are coming. Libraries will close earlier. Parks will b=
e dirtier. And city workers, who had been asking for big raises, will have =
to accept layoffs or pay cuts.=20
Even so, the city cannot get out of this hole alone. With taxes already too=
 high, it cannot reach much deeper into its citizens' pockets. And there ar=
e limits to how much it can cut services. A little federal help would go a =
long way toward righting the city's budget gap and restoring confidence in =
New York.=20
Mr. Moss suggests the federal government take two steps to show its commitm=
ent to the city. First, it should help create a hub in Lower Manhattan that=
 would connect transit lines from New Jersey and Long Island with the subwa=
y. Second, it should support ''security zones'' where high-profile securiti=
es firms and media companies could congregate if they wished.=20
For now, at least, it appears that Washington will let New York sink or swi=
m on its own. That decision is foolish for both economic and symbolic reaso=
ns.=20
If New York cannot right itself, the securities firms that are among its mo=
st important employers are as likely to move jobs to London or Hong Kong as=
 Chicago or Atlanta. And if New York's streets grow dirty and its crime rat=
e soars, other countries may question Washington's promises of aid to those=
 that try to deter terrorism. Will a government that does not bother to aid=
 its largest city in the wake of the worst terror attack in history really =
do much for Islamabad or Cairo?=20
''What do we have a federal government for if it's not to give aid to state=
 and local governments, at the level people live and get most of their gove=
rnment services?'' asks James A. Parrot, an economist at the Fiscal Policy =
Institute, a labor-backed research organization.=20
It is worse than unseemly that lawmakers are offering to pass a tax bill th=
at will give billions of dollars to companies like Enron and I.B.M. while r=
efusing to send New York money that that city has already been promised. It=
 is (whisper this word) unpatriotic.

Dot-Com Is Dot-Gone, And the Dream With It
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

11/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

MARK LEIBOVICH recalled the day in 1999 when he showed up early for an appo=
intment at a Washington dot-com. Mr. Leibovich, a reporter for The Washingt=
on Post, was there to interview the company's executives. ''I got there jus=
t in time to see the C.E.O. himself wheeling a foosball table into the lobb=
y'' to give the impression that the high-tech firm possessed the desired qu=
antum of wackiness that its Silicon Valley counterparts are famous for.=20
That is so over, and so much more over, even, than before. The popular obse=
ssion with the dot-com revolution, fading for more than a year, seems to ha=
ve simply winked out since mid-September, as firemen and warriors have beco=
me the new heroes, and e-commerce's whiz kids are consigned to the cultural=
 boneyard.
Not much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true b=
elievers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules. Not just=
 in tech-fetish magazines like Wired, but in self-styled cultural arbiters =
like New York magazine, which declared the 1990's the ''e-Decade.'' In a 19=
99 cover story, the essayist Michael Wolff -- himself a failed dot-com exec=
utive -- announced a brave new world. ''There is, at the elusive center of =
the e-experience, the fantasy that we might become free of economic laws,''=
 he wrote. ''All it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desir=
e.'' It wasn't enough to make money. They had to make history.=20
Now they themselves are history. Each day, the old idols seem to fade furth=
er into the dim past, barely recollected in a country where the languages o=
f ''revolution'' and ''warfare'' are no longer just business metaphors. Thi=
s is the next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble -- the=
 bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, o=
f the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.=20
The changing of the guard can be seen in little things. Like Henry Blodget,=
 the industry analyst who became famous for predicting early that Amazon.co=
m would reach $400 a share, announcing that he is taking a buyout and leavi=
ng Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35.=20
Like the growing wave of books that focus not on the dot-com path to riches=
 but on the wild plunge into the abyss. Having failed to sell their dreams,=
 they are now attempting to sell their failure. A documentary of the rise a=
nd fall of a Silicon Alley company was chronicled in ''Startup.Com'' by Seb=
astian Nokes, released last winter. Books by former dot-com executives are =
arriving in stores. Two of the first are ''A Very Public Offering: A Rebel'=
s Story of Business Excess, Success, and Reckoning'' by Stephan Paternot, f=
ounder of Theglobe.com, and ''Dot.bomb: My Days and Nights at an Internet G=
oliath,'' by J. David Kuo. Another is coming soon: ''Boo Hoo,'' the chronic=
le of the spectacular failure of Boo.com, the luxury fashion site that burn=
ed through $185 million of its investors' cash and had an online life of ju=
st six months, told by its profligate founders.=20
Did we mention that Mr. Blodget is writing a book?=20
For the most part, however, the flood of dot-com failure stories is being m=
et with a national yawn. The tell-all books have bounced around the Amazon.=
com rankings without making inroads into best-seller territory. And why not=
? Because former idols have feet of clay. In ''A Very Public Offering,'' a =
book written as amateurishly as the company was run, did we need the image =
of Mr. Paternot dancing the night away in plastic pants?=20
Ellen DeGeneres's new sitcom, ''The Ellen Show,'' is built around the notio=
n of an executive returning to her hometown after the collapse of her dot-c=
om, but the show sits at the miserable ranking of 93rd for the season -- be=
hind ''Emeril,'' the celebrity chef comedy -- despite Ms. DeGeneres's own c=
onsiderable appeal.=20
To Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University, the count=
ry is experiencing an abrupt cultural shift away from the libertarian, indi=
vidualistic values that were expressed in the celebration of the New Econom=
y and toward more old-fashioned values in the wake of the terrorist attacks=
, when government is not The Problem and people are not The Market. ''There=
's been a sea change,'' he said. The surge in charitable giving and blood d=
onations after Sept. 11, he said, underscores ''the sense that you're willi=
ng to give priority to the common good, to public safety and public health.=
''=20
Paulina Borsook, the author of ''Cyberselfish,'' a critical look at dot-com=
 values published last year, said: ''People really crave a reminder of huma=
n bonds that have to do with sacrifice and fellowship and getting to know e=
ach other over time. It's not about changing jobs every six months and gett=
ing stock options.''=20
In the 90's, college students hoping to emulate Marc Andreessen of Netscape=
 and other geek stars migrated to Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon Alle=
y with thin resumes and visions of Testarossas dancing in their heads. That=
's all changing, said Thomas T. Field, director of the Center for the Human=
ities at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ''Many of the young =
adults that I see coming to campus now say they want fulfilling jobs, not j=
ust ways of earning money,'' he said. ''Sounds awfully familiar, when you c=
ome from the 60's generation.''=20
Professor Field suggested that protests over globalism, and the sense of se=
curity that flourished during the boom, made young people more willing to q=
uestion the status quo and to take chances. During the I.P.O. frenzy, he sa=
id, students could not wait to get out of school and begin earning. This ye=
ar, many of his students have chosen to study abroad in China, Nepal, India=
 and Egypt.=20
The country is in dot-com denial, Ms. Borsook said, adding, ''No one wants =
to admit that they were caught up in it,'' an attitude she calls ''I don't =
want to think that I drank the Kool-Aid.''=20
Good riddance, said Thomas Frank, the author of ''One Market Under God: Ext=
reme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy.'' The b=
ook is a withering attack on the ideas underlying the selling of the New Ec=
onomy, which he says co-opted hipness and the language of populism to serve=
 greed and gain. The book has come out in paperback with a new afterword. '=
'It's going to take some time for it to sink in,'' Mr. Frank said. ''The Do=
w isn't going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren't going to come back -=
- and a lot of people lost a lot of money.''=20
Though dot-com executives might seem irrelevant these days, the technologie=
s they sold, by and large, are not, pointed out Paul Saffo, an analyst at t=
he Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ''People haven't stopped =
using the Internet,'' he said. ''The fact is that it is changing the world,=
 and it has changed the world.'' People now expect to be able to buy a book=
 or make an airline reservation in the middle of the night, ''and it's wash=
ed into the rest of their lives.''=20
Kevin Kelly, who as a longtime editor of Wired magazine helped create the h=
eroic ethos surrounding dot-com entrepreneurs, acknowledged ''it came tumbl=
ing down with the towers.'' But Mr. Kelly insisted that these people would =
rise again. The generation of tyro executives who crashed and burned ''got =
better business education than they could if they had gotten a Harvard M.B.=
A.,'' he said. ''They didn't set out to learn, but, boy, they are much smar=
ter now.'' He predicts that the last decade has been the ''layup'' for a tr=
ue cultural revolution to come -- he could not be specific, and his words m=
ay strike many as more dot-com hyperbole.=20
It takes a special kind of gall for the same people who argued that the ''l=
ong boom'' suspended the laws of economics, and even unraveled the cycles o=
f history, to fall back now on analysis of historical cycles to support the=
ir arguments.=20
But to believe any less goes against the American grain, argued Jason McCab=
e Calacanis, the editor of the now-defunct Silicon Alley Reporter. The dot-=
commer, seen today as a scam artist, will be reborn, he said, smarter and t=
ougher, because he represents optimism itself. ''It's the belief that the f=
uture -- the individual's future and the future of the economy -- are going=
 to be better in five years than they are today.''=20
But still. Take a look at the book ''Radical E'' by Glenn Rifkin and Joel K=
urtzman, which offers ''Lessons on How to Rule the Web'' after the bust. It=
 extols companies that truly understand how to marry the World Wide Web to =
business. ''After five tumultuous years of hype and hysteria,'' the authors=
 promise, ''the real advent of the Web and e-business is now.''=20
One of the book's chief examples of a company that does it right, Enron, ha=

of e-commerce. No, Enron -- which trades energy via the Web -- has seen its=

California Wary of Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron Energy: Both companies are p=
rominent players in the state's power market. The move to combine their str=
ength is raising some concerns.
NANCY RIVERA BROOKS
TIMES STAFF WRITER

Dynegy Inc. of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street, as it ride=
s to deliver cross-town rival Enron Corp. from its self-inflicted ills and =
save energy markets from serious distress through its proposed $9-billion b=
uyout of the world's largest energy trader.=20
But in California, Dynegy has a different image.
Dynegy, co-owner of several Southern California power plants, has been the =
quietest member of the "Big Five" group of energy producers commonly portra=
yed as villains by California politicians and regulators. Gov. Gray Davis a=
nd others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers "gougers" and =
"pirates" who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity, =
precipitating California's blackout-studded energy crisis.=20
Partly because of the heightened political sensitivities to all things surr=
ounding California's energy problems, the state is expected to play a centr=
al role in the proposed merger between Dynegy and Enron, antitrust experts =
and others say. The state's Attorney General's office already has begun scr=
utinizing the proposed combination.=20
If it merges with Enron, another favorite Davis target, Dynegy would be a p=
owerhouse in energy trading, electricity generation and natural gas transmi=
ssion. And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California, wh=
ich some find troubling.=20
"I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would =
consider this one carefully," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), one=
 of the architects of California's failed foray into electricity deregulati=
on, who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers. "If anythi=
ng, Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate m=
arkets than it was before."=20
Dynegy agreed on Nov. 9 to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about $=
9 billion and to inject $2.5 billion into crumbling Enron provided by cash-=
rich ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco-based oil company that owns nea=
rly 27% of Dynegy. But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclos=
ures keep slamming Enron's stock price, indicating that investors have thei=
r doubts that the deal will be completed as negotiated.=20
The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy, which is about a quarter of Enron's s=
ize, into the top ranks of energy merchants.=20
In California's energy world, Dynegy already is a key company. At every sig=
nificant twist in the state energy crisis, Dynegy was there, although not a=
s visibly as some of the other power-plant owners and electricity resellers=
.=20
Enron and Reliant Energy Inc., also of Houston, and Duke Energy Corp. of Ch=
arlotte, N.C., drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates=
 during the last 18 months as energy leaped higher. But Dynegy also was acc=
used by the state's grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its e=
lectricity bidding practices and, to a lesser extent, by holding back some =
electricity from its Southern California power plants.=20
In addition, Dynegy signed long-term electricity contracts with the state t=
hat have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative c=
lauses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs.=20
The California Independent System Operator, which runs the long-distance po=
wer transmission grid serving much of the state, has asked federal regulato=
rs to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices. Cal-ISO has made the =
same request concerning the other major power plant owners: Duke, Reliant, =
Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., which markets it=
s power through an agreement with Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.=20
"Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar," said Doug Heller of the Found=
ation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a consumer activist group.=20
"Not only did Dynegy do very well, but particularly its trading and marketi=
ng division did very well over the course of the last two years. It profite=
d wildly."=20
For its part, Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation, saying it =
has played a constructive role in the California marketplace, stepping forw=
ard to be one of the first companies to sign long-term contracts with the s=
tate when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of $300 million=
 owed the company by the state and its utilities.=20
"Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California," said Dynegy spo=
kesman John Sousa. "The fundamental problem in California is that supply di=
d not keep up with demand."=20
"Dynamic Energy"=20
Accused of Overcharging=20
Dynegy was created in 1984 as a natural gas trading operation known as Natu=
ral Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas =
prices. Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson, the company has expanded into n=
atural gas processing and distribution and electricity generation, changing=
 its name along the way to Dynegy, a word created by combining "dynamic" an=
d "energy."=20
In California, Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating 2,800 megawat=
ts of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis=
. (A megawatt can supply about 750 average homes with electricity.)=20
The state's big investor-owned utilities were required to sell some of thei=
r power plants by the landmark 1996 deregulation legislation. By the end of=
 1998, the Dynegy/NRG partnership had purchased three large power plants in=
 Long Beach, El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of 17 small "peaker"=
 plants from Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co=
.=20
Under the arrangement between the partnership, NRG operates the power plant=
s and Dynegy markets the electricity from them. It is Dynegy's bidding prac=
tices in selling that power into state markets that put it, along with othe=
r energy producers, on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federa=
l energy regulators.=20
Among the allegations:=20
* In a report released in March, Cal-ISO accused energy producers and resel=
lers, including Dynegy, of overcharging Californians by $6.7 billion betwee=
n May 2000 and March 2001. Power suppliers have denied the allegations. The=
 report also found that Dynegy reaped about $32 million in "monopoly rents"=
 between May and November of last year, or profits beyond what a competitiv=
e market would bear. That was the fourth-highest total for any company note=
d in the report. Enron was ranked sixth, taking $27.9 million in such profi=
ts.=20
* Cal-ISO said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known =
as "economic withholding," or bidding electricity at prices so high that th=
ey would be rejected, thereby pushing up the price charged for the remainin=
g generation sold into the market. Dynegy also did some "physical withholdi=
ng," Cal-ISO said, meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies t=
o drive up the price.=20
* Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoa=
rding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in 1998 and 1999,=
 causing natural gas prices to soar. Dynegy executives testified that the c=
harge was untrue.=20
* When federal regulators ordered $125 million in potential refunds for the=
 first four months of the year, Dynegy's portion was the largest among the =
power sellers named, representing slightly more than one third. Dynegy said=
 its prices were justified by high natural gas prices, emissions costs and =
other factors.=20
Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was "unfa=
irly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California mark=
et."=20
"As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulato=
rs and to industry officials, we remain ready and willing to generate and s=
ell power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are=
 able to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obliga=
tion to pay for those purchases."=20
A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegy'=
s assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market.=
=20
During the first three months of this year, after sky-high prices pushed Ed=
ison and PG&E so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy =
power for their customers, Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price=
 of $239.63 per megawatt-hour for electricity. That was slightly below the =
average of $268.90 per megawatt-hour charged by all sellers.=20
Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market, represen=
ting about 4% of the state's generation.=20
But Cal-ISO, in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegy's authority to s=
ell power at market rates, said "Dynegy has profited systematically from th=
e exercise of market power to the significant harm of California's electric=
 consumers and economy." A decision is pending.=20
Officials reviewing the Dynegy-Enron merger will closely review the compani=
es' operations in California.=20
Although Enron owns no power plants in California, it is believed to have l=
ong-term contracts with some generators, although spokesman Eric Thode refu=
sed to detail them.=20
In addition, Enron has a hand in 25% of the energy trades around the nation=
, with a significant portion of that in California. Thode would not detail =
California operations, citing company policy.=20
Finally, Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas, which is use=
d to generate about one-third of the state's electricity, through its trans=
western pipeline, which crosses into California, and through natural gas ma=
rketing and trading arrangements.=20
It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many en=
ergy watchdogs worried. They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy ca=
n drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time.=
=20
A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bus=
tamante, acting as a private citizen, described it this way: "The Dynegy tr=
ading floor, working with the trading floors operated by Williams, Mirant, =
Reliant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used t=
o inflate the price of electricity within their respective markets, as well=
 as throughout the state of California."=20
"These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures, forwards, opti=
ons and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflati=
ng the price of electricity within their respective markets," the suit char=
ged.=20
"These defendants engaged in 'megawatt laundering,' in which they made trad=
es with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within th=
eir respective markets."=20
State Is Examining Proposed Merger=20
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a =
merger would have on California, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. The Fede=
ral Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will=
 scrutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take =
no more than nine months.=20
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said she =
plans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the =
companies own in the market to examine "inputs" into the market such as gas=
 pipeline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy an=
d Enron.=20
"It really raises many questions about how the market works," Bowen said.=
=20
Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger, said Ga=
rret Rasmussen, a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington, D.C., and formerl=
y a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator.=20
The state, if it chooses, could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotia=
tions over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Micr=
osoft Corp., he said.=20
"While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers ... an action=
 by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of succ=
ess," Rasmussen said.=20
Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation=20
The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power=
 contract with Dynegy, which contains the unusual provision that the state =
would pay for any emission costs that the company incurred, said V. John Wh=
ite, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency & Renewable Technologies =
in Sacramento. Dynegy's large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution contr=
ol equipment, he said.=20
"The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegy's enviro=
nmental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the long-t=
erm contract," White said. "Dynegy has a Texas, the-least-we-can-do attitud=
e as far as the environment is concerned."=20
David Freemen, the former Los Angeles Department of Water & Power general m=
anager who helped negotiate Dynegy's and other long-term contracts, said th=
at while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves, the agreement=
s, now maligned as too expensive, were key to stabilizing the electricity m=
arket. Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process.=20
"There's a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and rea=
ched agreement--like Dynegy, Calpine and Williams--and those that were reac=
hing for the moon and we didn't reach agreement," Freeman said. "Dynegy kne=
w that they wanted to do business in California, and do it in a businesslik=
e manner."

Enron's Troubles Could Spur Securities Reforms

Ultimately, the fall of Enron Corp., the onetime rising star of the energy =
industry, may be remembered as a landmark in the annals of securities law a=
nd shareholder rights.=20
The firm's practices are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission. Enron is the focus of numerous shareholder lawsuits that seek =
to recover damages from the $60-billion plunge in the company's value in th=
e last year.
The Enron case could result in new securities laws, experts say. It also co=
uld result in massive damage awards because of the extent of stockholder lo=
sses. Shares sold at more than $84 apiece a year ago, and at $36 a month ag=
o before the emergence of hidden losses sent the price reeling downward to =
current levels below $5 a share. (The stock closed Friday at $4.71 on the N=
ew York Stock Exchange.)=20
Significantly, two suits against Enron charge that the firm's top executive=
s breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty and prudence by failing to infor=
m Enron employees of dangers to the company's finances while those employee=
s held Enron stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.=20
The firm's troubles raise fundamental questions of what a company owes shar=
eholders in the management and understandable disclosure of its accounts.=
=20
But Enron's predicament also goes to the heart of the U.S. financial system=
, says former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. Enron "represents a lack of the k=
ind of disclosure that is fundamental to maintaining confidence in U.S. pub=
lic markets," Levitt says.=20
Enron, technically speaking, disclosed in annual reports and proxy statemen=
ts for 1999 and 2000 the existence of partnerships that in some cases "acqu=
ired debt and certain equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries." But=
 it did not disclose the significance of the partnerships, nor did it conso=
lidate their transactions in its reports to shareholders and the SEC.=20
Its references to the partnerships were in footnotes to financial statement=
s, written in the arcane legal language typical of such documents. For exam=
ple, disclosure of one partnership, LJM Cayman, read in part: "LJM received=
 6.8 million shares of Enron common stock, subject to certain restrictions =
and Enron received a note receivable and certain financial instruments hedg=
ing an investment held by Enron."=20
Enron entered into at least 33 partnerships, attracting investments from pe=
nsion funds and other investors in return for pledges of Enron stock at a g=
uaranteed value. One partnership held 12 million Enron shares, which at one=
 point were worth more than $1 billion.=20
Yet until this year, Enron treated the partnerships as insignificant to its=
 overall business, and so they were not required to be included in its over=
all accounts.=20
By treating its partnerships as non-consolidated subsidiaries, Enron could =
report lower debt burdens than it actually had, thus strengthening its cred=
it and enabling itself to grow into the largest energy trader in the world.=
=20
Enron became a pioneer of energy trading, a way of using financial techniqu=
es of trading forward commitments in natural gas and electricity to establi=
sh future prices on long-term supply contracts. As the business boomed, Enr=
on's revenue soared, from $20 billion in 1997 to $100 billion in 2000. Thro=
ugh three quarters of this year, the firm was on course to exceed $200 bill=
ion in revenue.=20
But in October, Enron announced that it had lost more than $600 million in =
the third quarter and that it needed to reduce shareholder equity by more t=
han $1 billion due to transactions with one of its partnerships.=20
Then on Nov. 8, Enron restated its accounts back to 1997, acknowledging tha=
t some of its partnerships should have been included in company accounts al=
l along. The restatement resulted in a reduction of reported profit by more=
 than $500 million. Enron's board of directors and auditors had ordered the=
 restatement, the firm said.=20
The stock price fell further, lawsuits ensued and Enron sought refuge in a =
merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's financial position and stock price have wea=
kened since the merger announcement Nov. 9., so the Dynegy deal may go thro=
ugh at a reduced price, says analyst Stanley Foster Reed, who runs MergerCe=
ntral.com, an online information service.=20
But the question remains of how such a large, significant company could col=
lapse with so little advance notice.=20
Enron was a prominent company, not least because of Chairman Kenneth Lay's =
connections to the White House as formal energy advisor to the first Bush a=
dministration and as informal advisor to the current Bush administration.=
=20
The firm had more than 20,000 employees before recent layoffs, and it had m=
illions of investors through the holdings of pension funds such as the Cali=
fornia Public Employees' Retirement System, the college teachers retirement=
 plan TIAA-CREF and major mutual funds. Yet for all its prominence, Enron's=
 disclosures about its business were inadequate. "Disclosure" sounds like a=
 technical term, but it is the principle behind the laws passed in 1933 and=
 subsequent years to regulate securities markets and protect the public.=20
Companies issuing stock to raise financing from public investors are requir=
ed to disclose accurate and complete information about their business and t=
o have accounts certified by independent public accounting firms. The SEC, =
created in 1933, could not stop a company from issuing stock, but it could =
make it disclose all relevant facts about risks in its business.=20
The laws were written in the midst of the Great Depression, which followed =
the 1929 stock market crash. They were designed to remedy abuses such as th=
e case of Charles Mitchell, head of City National Bank (a predecessor firm =
of today's Citgroup), who sold his own company's shares short--that is, he =
bet on their price declining--just before the crash, without informing othe=
r shareholders. Before securities laws, Mitchell had no legal requirement t=
o disclose his activities; once the laws were passed, all top managers and =
directors of public companies had such legal, fiduciary duty.=20
The Enron case probably will lead to new laws regulating investments in sub=
sidiaries, experts say. The SEC staff has contemplated such regulations in =
the past but never made them law.=20
And the fallout from Enron could lead to tighter restrictions on firms putt=
ing their stock in employee retirement accounts. Also, it could lead to tig=
hter regulations on statements by top managers on the condition of the busi=
ness.=20
"This will be a case, with major issues of concealment from shareholders," =
says San Francisco attorney Steven Siderman, who is preparing a class-actio=
n lawsuit against Enron and Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm.=20
Enron executives gave no indication of the company's troubles as late as Au=
gust, when Jeffrey Skilling, president and chief executive for only six mon=
ths, abruptly resigned. In response to questions of trouble in the company,=
 Skilling said, "There's nothing to disclose. The company's in great shape.=
"=20
Lay, who stepped back into the top post, told employees in August that Enro=
n's business was strong. "We've got a lot of great stuff going on and we're=
 not getting credit for it in the marketplace, but we will," Lay said.=20
However, both Lay and Skilling had been selling Enron stock for more than a=
 year at that point, Lay cashing out more than $140 million in stock option=
s and Skilling more than $60 million in options.=20
Meanwhile, employee 401(k) accounts, heavily laden with Enron stock, were f=
rozen this year because the firm changed account managers. Employees were s=
tuck as the stock plummeted.=20
The principle behind securities laws is that management of a public company=
, with so many employees, pensioners and other institutions depending on it=
, is a public trust.=20
The charge in the lawsuits being filed against Enron is that the firm, its =
executives and directors betrayed that trust.=20
Everyone is entitled to a fair trial, and Enron and its executives will sur=
ely have many days in court in the months and years to come in which to def=
end against the charge of betrayal of shareholders and employees.=20
The Enron case will be a landmark.=20

Hooked On a Fast- Growth Habit; CEOs Reach for Double-Digit Results Despite=
 Downturn, and Some Are Making Costly Mistakes

At this point, they almost can't help themselves -- it's become an addictio=
n for the top executives of Corporate America.=20
Delivering double-digit earnings growth year after year is no longer simply=
 what corporate re-engineers call a "stretch goal" for an organization, or =
a rare achievement to be celebrated. It's become a mandate, a benchmark, a =
test of corporate manhood, an expectation hard-wired into the corporate cul=
ture -- a narcotic that company leaders reach for the way most people reach=
 for an aspirin.
Never mind that the economy is contracting, or that prices are falling and =
profit margins are getting squeezed, or that most industries are unlikely t=
o grow more than 5 percent a year even after the recovery is here. The name=
 of the game these days is boosting the stock price, and the surest way to =
do that is to promise -- and deliver -- double-digit profit growth to Wall =
Street's cadre of analysts and money managers.=20
It's not just in the tech and telecom sectors, where the inflated growth ex=
pectations first took root. The addiction to double-digit growth has spread=
 across the corporate landscape to firms in older, mature industries desper=
ate for the "growth company" moniker that qualifies them for Wall Street's =
highest reward: a stock price equal to 20, 30, even 40 times their expected=
 annual earnings.=20
In the 1990s, "we went through a period of extraordinary high growth in pro=
fitability, and both managers and stock analysts have unthinkingly come to =
the conclusion that that was the norm," said Michael Jensen, a professor of=
 finance at the Harvard Business School. "Top-level management came to beli=
eve they could get a big company to grow 20, 30, 40 percent year after year=
 -- it was insanity. And in the process of trying to make that real, rather=
 than acknowledging it was a transitory phenomenon, more than a few wound u=
p destroying shareholder value rather than enhancing it."=20
Jensen said that it is now common for Wall Street earnings expectations to =
be the starting point for corporate budgeting and strategy-setting rather t=
han the result of it. "Nothing could be more irresponsible," he said.=20
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in M=
inneapolis, says this fascination with high growth rates peaked in 1999, at=
 the height of the stock market boom, when only 50 stocks in the Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index -- the hottest 50 growth companies -- actually went=
 up in value. In fact, these nifty 50 went up so much so that they lifted t=
he overall market indexes with them. The other 450 stocks declined.=20
"At that point, investors were only paying for growth," Paulsen said. "Divi=
dends, good cash flow, reliability -- they all meant nothing."=20
"If you were just growing at a stodgy 8 or 9 percent a year, you were negle=
cted, ignored," said Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School=
 of Management at the University of Pennsylvania. "You couldn't get good va=
luations."=20
In desperation, boring old electric utilities refashioned themselves into "=
merchant energy companies," while highly profitable pork producers added ne=
w product lines in order to be viewed as ready-to-eat food companies. And p=
erfectly good retail companies threw millions of dollars into misguided Web=
 ventures.=20
With the dot-com bust and the broader stock market collapse over the past y=
ear, many executives, investors and analysts claim to have learned their le=
sson and reduced expectations for growth. But according to Siegel, Paulsen =
and other experts, expectations remain unreasonably high by historical stan=
dards. Many of those executives, investors and analysts believe business to=
 be in a temporary lull before the "norm" of double-digit growth reasserts =
itself sometime next year.=20
"Most people's expectations are still way too optimistic," said Bill Miller=
, the legendary manager of Legg Mason's Value Trust, a $12 billion mutual f=
und.=20
David Nadler, chairman of Mercer Delta Consulting, says this "tyranny of gr=
owth" continues to lead too many companies to expand too quickly, make ill-=
advised acquisitions or diversify out of their areas of expertise. "The exp=
erience on that is that their shareholders wind up paying dearly for those =
mistakes," he said.=20
Indeed, many of the celebrated corporate crackups of the past year -- think=
 of Conseco Inc.'s costly foray into manufactured-home financing, Providian=
 Financial Corp.'s debacle with sub-prime credit card lending, Freightliner=
 LLC's truck glut and the record $50 billion write-off of acquisition costs=
 by JDS Uniphase Corp. -- came about as a result of companies trying to pus=
h earnings growth to the limit.=20
Corporate executives certainly have plenty of incentive to play the growth =
game, whether consciously or unconsciously. Most have multimillion-dollar c=
ompensation packages that include bonuses, stock and stock options, all tie=
d directly to growth in earnings and share price. And a rising stock price =
gives them a valuable new currency -- currency that can be used to buy shor=
t-term earnings growth through mergers and acquisitions and to offer valuab=
le stock options when recruiting top management and technical talent.=20
The stock option has a particularly pernicious impact, according to David M=
orrison, vice chairman of Mercer Management Consulting Inc. and co-author o=
f "The Profit Zone." Options become more valuable as the price of the compa=
ny stock rises above the point at which the options are issued. On the othe=
r hand, if things go bad, it doesn't matter how much the price of the stock=
 goes below the "strike price" -- the value remains zero. As a result of th=
is asymmetry between upside potential and downside risk, says Morrison, it =
is common for executives to take bigger risks with their companies than the=
y otherwise would have.=20
Ego also plays a role. Chief executives who deliver year after year of doub=
le-digit earnings growth wind up being lionized in business books, on magaz=
ine covers and on cable-TV news shows. They are invited to serve on other c=
orporate boards and to speak at investor conferences organized by celebrity=
 analysts. Their boards of directors give them wide latitude in running the=
 company.=20
By contrast, CEOs who don't have a good growth story to tell, or can't deli=
ver on it, risk finding themselves in early retirement.=20
Jeff Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, recently interviewed 40=
 of the leading corporate chief executives for a new book, "The Mind of the=
 CEO." And more often than not, Garten said, the executives told him off th=
e record that while they knew the expectations about earnings growth are of=
ten unreasonable and unsustainable, they had no choice but to participate, =
or risk being dismissed as someone who simply "doesn't get it."=20
"The system penalized anyone who didn't play the game," Garten said. As a r=
esult, executives find themselves on a treadmill -- always in a desperate s=
earch for ways to deliver the next increment of growth that will justify th=
e unrealistic earnings expectations in which they themselves were complicit=
.=20
Analyst William Steele said he has seen it time and again in the consumer p=
roducts sector that he follows for Bank of America Securities Inc., as comp=
anies that had always been "solid singles hitters" suddenly started swingin=
g for the fences.=20
"What you've seen is companies making ill-advised acquisitions, abusing the=
ir balance sheets [by taking on too much debt or issuing too much stock] an=
d under-investing in their brands," said Steele.=20
Take the case of Freeport, Ill.-based Newell Co., which for more than 30 ye=
ars had enjoyed steady earnings growth by buying up underperforming housewa=
res companies and "Newellizing" them -- bringing in new management, cutting=
 costs, scrapping unprofitable products, consolidating distribution and win=
ning more space on retail shelves. But by the late 1990s, after 75 acquisit=
ions that included Calphalon cookware, Levelor window blinds and Rolodex ca=
rd files, the number of good turnaround prospects had dwindled. And with gr=
owth in sales of consumer products slowing to single digits, Newell executi=
ves needed something that would keep them in double-digit territory.=20
That something, they thought, was Rubbermaid, for years one of the most res=
pected companies among executives and investors, but one that had stumbled =
badly beginning in 1996. It was far and away Newell's biggest acquisition, =
bought with newly issued Newell stock valued at $5.8 billion, a 50 percent =
premium over Rubbermaid's market price at the time.=20
The Rubbermaid deal closed in the spring of 1999, and Newell Rubbermaid's f=
inancial performance has declined ever since, a reflection not only of the =
slowing economy but of problems within the company itself. Total profits fo=
r the combined firm are barely higher than they were before the acquisition=
, and because of the debt taken on and new shares issued to finance the pur=
chase, the best measures of financial performance -- earnings per share and=
 return on assets -- have both declined. After the company repeatedly faile=
d to meet the quarterly sales and growth target it had promised Wall Street=
, chief executive John J. McDonough was fired in October of last year.=20
Given that history, the current economic uncertainty and continued weakness=
 in quarterly earnings, one might think that Newell's new executive team wo=
uld steer clear of making grand promises to Wall Street. But in June, after=
 barely six months on the job, the new chief executive, Joseph Galli Jr., t=
old Wall Street analysts that a restructuring program he had instituted wou=
ld allow the company to post a 15 percent earnings increase in 2002. At $26=
, analysts say the stock price now reflects an expectation that Newell Rubb=
ermaid will meet this double-digit growth target.=20
In an interview last week, William T. Alldredge, Newell's chief financial o=
fficer, explained that the 15 percent growth target for next year was reaso=
nable because the company's profits this year, against which next year's wi=
ll be compared, are so depressed. Going forward, however, he acknowledged t=
hat growth rates would be closer to 10 percent than 15 percent, and they wo=
uld come from squeezing more profit out of existing brands rather than thro=
ugh acquisitions.=20
"I'm not sure we see the enormous upside potential that we once did," said =
Alldredge, who insisted, nonetheless, that Wall Street should continue to v=
alue Newell Rubbermaid as a "growth company."=20
To this day, "old-fashioned" chief executives such as Warren Buffett remain=
 puzzled as to why executives still can't resist the urge to promise invest=
ors any particular level of earnings growth, given all the uncertainties of=
 running a business. In the annual report to shareholders of his Berkshire =
Hathaway Inc. in February, he noted that only a handful of companies have e=
ver been able to sustain 15 percent earnings growth for more than a decade.=
 Such promises, he said, not only spread "unwarranted optimism" among inves=
tors, he said, but "corrode" behavior by top executives -- in some cases be=
havior so corrosive that it spills over into deceptive accounting. As it tu=
rns out, the chief executives of Sunbeam, Xerox, Waste Management and Enron=
 all lost their jobs in recent years after major-league earnings overstatem=
ents were uncovered during their watch.=20
(Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is a significant investor in The Washington P=
ost Co., which, like Berkshire, provides no earnings guidance to Wall Stree=
t investors.)=20
James Johnson, the former chairman of Fannie Mae, has heard all these criti=
cisms, and can even add a few of his own. But he said that for every compan=
y that overpromised and overreached, there were others where the focus on e=
arnings growth has led to breakthrough innovations, successful new corporat=
e strategies and big gains in productivity.=20
"It's what makes American capitalism so unique -- and so successful," said =
Johnson, whose ability to deliver on a promise of double-digit earnings gro=
wth in every year but one led to a dramatic increase in Fannie Mae's stock =
price during his tenure. It also made Johnson a very rich man.=20
"It's a tricky balance," said David Winters, president and chief investment=
 officer of Mutual Series Fund Inc., a New Jersey-based mutual fund. "You d=
on't want companies to be sleepy, or set the bar so low that they can easil=
y step over it. But you don't want companies that overpromise and underdeli=
ver."=20
Certainly no chief executive took the goal of posting double-digit earnings=
 growth each year more seriously than John F. Welch Jr., who recently retir=
ed as chairman of General Electric Co. On Jack Welch's watch, division mana=
gers who failed to contribute to the corporate goal were routinely fired or=
 had their divisions sold off. And critics have charged that the unrelentin=
g pressure led, on occasion, to accounting gimmicks and questionable busine=
ss practices -- a charge Welch repeatedly denied.=20
Yet according to Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Busi=
ness School, it was the demand for double-digit earnings growth year after =
year that forced managers of GE's old-line manufacturing divisions to get i=
nto the growing and profitable business of servicing and financing the turb=
ines and medical equipment they made.=20
"I don't know when it would ever be the right decision not to try to grow f=
ast," said Tichy, co-author of a book titled "Every Business Is a Growth Bu=
siness." And even while acknowledging that companies have been known to do =
dumb things in the pursuit of earnings growth, the good ones don't.=20
"If you don't have goals that force executives to stretch themselves and th=
eir organization, you don't optimize performance," Tichy said.=20
Business guru James Collins disagrees. In a new book, "Good to Great," Coll=
ins argues that the companies that sustain really high growth rates over lo=
ng periods of time are those that don't set growth as an explicit goal. Rat=
her, Collins says, the best companies operate less out of some corporate br=
avado than a determination to understand their business and their success a=
nd to capitalize on that understanding.=20
"Great companies don't come about because the CEO wants to be a celebrity o=
r please the share-flippers, and certainly not because he or she wants to h=
it the top targets on the compensation plan," Collins said last week. "The =
common thread among the CEOs of the truly great companies is that their amb=
ition is to build something that can outlast themselves. The growth comes a=
s a byproduct of that."=20
Harvard's Jensen said that the only way to lick Corporate America's growth =
addiction is for more executives to muster the courage to stand up to Wall =
Street and begin setting realistic expectations for their companies. Such a=
 strategy might occasionally require a CEO to tell investors that his compa=
ny's stock is overvalued -- a truly novel idea in today's environment, wher=
e executives almost reflexively complain that their share price is too low.=
 And it might require executives at some companies to make clear that their=
 stock may be inappropriate for growth funds and hedge-fund managers.=20
"Companies generally get the shareholders they deserve," said Miller, Legg =
Mason's money manager.=20
But Norman Augustine, the retired chairman of Lockheed Martin Corp., warns =
that "standing up to Wall Street" may not be as easy as it sounds.=20
"We all sit around complaining about the short-term mentality on Wall Stree=
t and the fund managers who say they'll dump our stocks if we don't show do=
uble-digit earnings growth every quarter," Augustine said. "And then the ma=
nager of our own corporate pension fund comes in and says, 'We have two fun=
ds that didn't do well for us this quarter, so I dumped them.'=20
"And there it is," Augustine said. "We have met the enemy, and it is us!"

The Enron scandal

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=
=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=
agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=
ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =
a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=
are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =
investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=
ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =
Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=
here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=
nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=
d make an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=
cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=
ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=
ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=
sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=
 kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=
 this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=
 itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=
reshold(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=
he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=
e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=
 as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=
nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=
t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=
alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=
ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=
ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=
 always somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=
ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =
the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers=
e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =
Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=
ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=
 that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=
lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=
" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =
inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=
tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=
 in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=
et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=
n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=
ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =
little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

Enron Says It's Still in Talks With Possible Investors for Cash

Enron Says It's Still in Talks With Possible Investors for Cash

     Houston, Nov. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said talks are
continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as
$1 billion, as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse
of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.

     An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened
finances may prompt Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms
of the transaction, which is valued at $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt.

     Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in
cash but wouldn't divulge details. ``We are not going to discuss
the particulars of who we are talking to,'' said Enron spokeswoman
Karen Denne.

     Shares of the Houston company fell by 48 percent in the past
three trading sessions. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the
stock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to
pay in the acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the
transaction will go through as planned.

     Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group for a private
equity investment, said industry analyst David Snow of
PrivateEquityCentral.Net. The firms have declined to comment.

     On a conference call Nov. 14 Enron Chief Financial Officer
Jeffrey McMahon said the company is in talks with several private
investors and expects to receive $500 million to $1 billion from
these sources.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said
he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note
payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility.
He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from
ChevronTexaco Inc. as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy will acquire preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.

     Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy may have a
difficult time walking away from the deal because its right to the
pipeline might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and
Salomon Smith Barney Inc., who accepted the asset as collateral
for $1 billion in loans to Enron.

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's
attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for Enron is a
condition of keeping the merger alive.

     Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a
federal investigation of the company, which restated its earnings
and saw its credit ratings cut.

     The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week
ago that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines
left.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK - Enron seeks survival pact to aid Dynegy's $9bn res=
cue.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

Crisis-hit Enron is seeking to extend its survival pact with its key lender=
s long enough to be rescued by Dynegy, the rival energy group.=20
Dynegy said it was "continuing with confirmatory due diligence" for its all=
-stock rescue bid. The offer is still worth $9.3bn ( #6.5m), even though En=
ron's market capitalisation has halved this week to $3.5bn.
Enron's survival is crucial to the smooth running of the electricity and po=
wer markets, where it claims to be the principal in 25 per cent of all tran=
sactions.=20
Enron sought to allay fears that Dynegy might change the terms of its offer=
, or withdraw.=20
Withdrawal of the rescue bid would call into question Enron's credit rating=
s, which remain one notch above "junk" status. Ratings agencies held off do=
wngrading Enron two weeks ago, because such a decision would trigger repaym=
ent of debt issued by off-balance-sheet partnerships that Enron used to sup=
port its rapid expansion over the past two to three years.=20
Even so, the terms of recent credit lines extended to Enron suggest lenders=
 already regard the company as a non-investment grade risk. The bonds are t=
rading as though the company is heading for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.=
=20
Glen Grabelsky of Fitch, the rating agency, said there were two possible ou=
tcomes for Enron: "One is that the transaction goes through; and the other =
is that the viability of this company is in question."=20
Enron's shares fell to $4.74, a further 5.4 per cent drop, in a shortened s=
ession of trading yesterday morning in New York, as investors continued to =
express concern about Dynegy's commitment to the deal.=20
John Olson, vice president of research at Sanders Morris Harris, the Housto=
n-based investment banking and securities firm, said: "With Enron trading a=
t 4 bucks and change it might make sense for them to go into bankruptcy and=
 salvage this thing the right way."=20
Observers close to Enron say Wednesday's decision by JP Morgan Chase and Ci=
tigroup to finalise a $1bn secured credit line, and the deferral of a $690m=
 repayment of notes due next Tuesday, have reduced the pressure on the grou=
p. If Dynegy were to renegotiate the terms of its deal - and that may depen=
d on legal clauses within the original merger agreement - that would not af=
fect Enron's financial situation, they say.=20
As well as negotiating with its lenders through the weekend, Enron is also =
seeking further investments from JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and private equ=
ity firms in an attempt to shore up confidence. www.ft.com/enron.=20

USA: Enron employees sue as pension savings evaporate.
By Andrew Kelly

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - After climbing utility poles in all kinds of we=
ather for 35 years, Roy Rinard was hoping to retire in a few years, but tha=
t was before the collapse in Enron Corp.'s stock price devoured his retirem=
ent savings.=20
"I'm basically wiped out," said Rinard, 54, who works for Portland General =
Electric, an Oregon utility company acquired by the Houston-based energy tr=
ading giant in 1997.
"I'm right back to ground zero and I'll have to go on working as long as I =
can," said Rinard, who suffers from arthritis and a lung condition that lea=
ves him short of breath.=20
Encouraged by Enron's then-strong performance and the company's bullish vie=
w of its future prospects, Rinard moved all of the money invested in his 40=
1(k) retirement account into Enron stock earlier this year.=20
But it proved to be a costly decision as the value of his account fell from=
 $470,000 a year ago to around $40,000 today.=20
Rinard now hopes a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Houston will rec=
over at least some of his money.=20
The suit, filed on behalf of Enron employees by Seattle-based law firm Hage=
ns Berman, alleges that Enron breached its fiduciary duty by encouraging it=
s employees to invest heavily in Enron stock without warning them of the ri=
sks of doing so.=20
Enron's stock, which peaked at $90 in August 2000, closed at $4.74 on Frida=
y, after falling sharply in recent weeks amid a series of damaging financia=
l disclosures.=20
A broadly similar suit filed by the Keller Rohrback law firm, also Seattle =
based, alleges that another Enron employee, Pamela Tittle, lost $140,000 on=
 Enron stock held in her retirement account.=20
According to that suit, the Enron retirement savings plan had assets worth =
$2.1 billion at the end of last year, including $1.3 billion, or 62 percent=
 of the total, in Enron stock.=20
DOUBTS EMERGE ABOUT DYNEGY DEAL=20
Enron, a former Wall Street favorite, agreed to be bought out earlier this =
month by smaller energy trading rival Dynegy Inc., but continuing problems =
at Enron have caused some analysts to question whether the deal will be com=
pleted.=20
Doubts have also been expressed about a planned sale of Portland General to=
 Northwest Natural Gas .=20
Hagens Berman plans to seek class-action status for its suit and says 21,00=
0 Enron employees could be eligible to join it.=20
The suit alleges that Enron "locked down" 401(k) retirement accounts on Oct=
. 17, preventing employees from changing the investments they held in their=
 accounts until Nov. 19.=20
During that period Enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years an=
d took a charge of $1.2 billion against stockholders' equity as a result of=
 off-balance-sheet deals that would later come under investigation by U.S. =
regulators.=20
In that time, Enron shares fell from $30.72 at the close of trading Oct. 16=
 to $11.69 on Nov. 19.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said employees' access to the accounts was bl=
ocked as part of a previously planned change in the administration of the r=
etirement plan and that the measure was in effect from Oct. 26. to Nov. 19.=
=20
Steve Lacey, a 45-year-old emergency repair dispatcher who has worked for P=
ortland General Electric for 21 years, said the measure came at a time when=
 bad news about Enron was flying thick and fast, driving the stock price do=
wn at a dizzying pace.=20
"We couldn't take our money out of Enron stock into another portfolio. Basi=
cally they had us locked down to where we had no say over our own future," =
he said.=20
Lacey declined to quantify his own losses but said he and many of his colle=
agues had invested most of their retirement funds in Enron stock because it=
 had performed better in the past than the other investments available unde=
r the Enron plan.=20
Denne said Enron employees were normally able to choose among 18 different =
investment options, but Enron's matching contributions were always made in =
the form of its own stock.=20
Lacey said he felt sorry for older colleagues at Portland General who had s=
uffered a heavy financial blow just before they were due to retire, adding =
that he was only beginning to realize how serious the consequences could be=
 for himself.=20
"My goal was to have an extremely comfortable retirement and that may be a =
little clouded now," he said.

Canadian Oil and gas companies on high alert after terror alert

The Canadian Press=20
Copyright (c) 2001 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.=20
VANCOUVER (CP) _ Canadian oil and gas companies are on high alert after bei=
ng warned that Islamic terrorists loyal to Osama bin Laden may be planning =
to blow up energy installations and pipelines in North America.=20
The warning, issued last week by the American Petroleum Institute, said ``s=
uch an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden=
, or Taliban leader Mullah Omar, are either captured or killed.''=20
The alert was distributed to select officials of utility companies througho=
ut North America by the institute, the industry's official voice.=20
It said the information ``that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to a=
ttack natural gas supplies'' is currently ``uncorroborated,'' pending furth=
er FBI checks.=20
But it advised utility companies that ``the planning that went into the Sep=
t. 11 attacks strongly suggests that terrorist cells are already establishe=
d inside the U.S. and may simply be awaiting instructions to strike.''=20
``Failing to strike a high-profile blow against targets on American soil wi=
ll raise the question of Taliban and al-Qaida legitimacy in their global fi=
ght against the United States.''=20
The institute did not identify the source of the information nor potential =
targets. It is understood the RCMP have been notified of the alert.=20
B.C. Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said it has received the alert and will ``st=
ay vigilant.''=20
The priority, he said, is pipeline security.=20
``Some additional precautions have been taken but I do not want to go into =
any details,'' Pelkey said.=20
A security analyst, who asked not to be named, said measures taken by Canad=
ian utility companies are likely to include restricting access to sensitive=
 areas, a high-profile presence with guards and closing off areas such as a=
bove-ground wells and pipeline junctions.=20
Aerial surveillance of pipeline routes and installation of remote-sensing d=
evices may also be part of the plan.=20
``Generally, underground pipelines and storage facilities are difficult to =
target,'' he said.=20
``What is key when you are dealing with Islamic terrorists is to prevent th=
e use of suicide bombers and car bombs to attack above-ground installations=
.''=20
In addition to B.C. Gas's hundreds of kilometres of gas pipelines and stora=
ge facilities, security has also been stepped up at B.C. Hydro's 29 dams, f=
our thermal plants and 1,825 kilometres of major transmission lines.=20
Even before last week's alert, the Alberta government formed a ministerial =
security task force to enhance security at energy production and transmissi=
on facilities.=20
The facilities include Edmonton's Refinery Row, Fort Saskatchewan's petroch=
emical and chemical projects and the pipeline network.=20
That includes the collector point at Empress, Alta., east of Calgary near t=
he Saskatchewan border, the petrochemicals plants at Joffre, Alta., east of=
 Red Deer, and Fort McMurray's oilsands project.


USA: FERC rule on natgas shipping needs more work-industry.
By Chris Baltimore

11/21/2001=20
Reuters English News Service=20
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.=20
WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (=
FERC) proposal to loosen scheduling rules for natural gas pipeline shippers=
, meant to boost competition and supplies, could have the opposite effect, =
some companies and industry groups told the agency this week.=20
FERC proposed the changes last month to enhance competition on the U.S. int=
erstate natural gas pipeline grid by allowing gas shippers to make same-day=
 changes to their schedules to meet changing supply and demand.=20
The changes are supported by the American Gas Association, which represents=
 U.S. gas producers.=20
FERC stepped in after the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB), the industry=
's self-regulating rulemaking body, failed to reach consensus on the issue.=
=20
Current GISB standards require pipeline operators to wait at least a day be=
fore changing their preset shipment schedules, which slows the market's abi=
lity to react to changing conditions, FERC said.=20
Instead, FERC proposed allowing pipeline shippers to make same-day changes =
in schedules.=20
The agency's comment period on the proposal, which ended on Monday, produce=
d a mixed reaction from pipeline operators and industry groups.=20
The Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) warned FERC in a written filin=
g the change could reduce the flexibility of electric generators to obtain =
natural gas supplies.=20
The trade group, which represents independent power generators and marketer=
s, asked FERC to limit pipeline operators' authority to change schedules to=
 give power plant operators greater supply certainty.=20
A group representing pipeline owners also expressed concern.=20
The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said the new rules could =
"increase market volatility and thereby could reduce flexibility and reliab=
ility for other parties." The pipeline group asked FERC to clarify some lan=
guage in the rule to allay concerns.=20
A Dynegy Inc letter to FERC also warned the rule could degrade reliability.=
=20
An Enron Corp. subsidiary agreed the changes could increase flexibility and=
 competition, but raised concerns that newly available capacity might not b=
e offered equitably to market participants.=20
Enron and El Paso Corp. , which owns one of the largest U.S. pipeline syste=
ms, asked FERC to hold a technical conference on how the changes would be i=
mplemented.=20
Williams Cos Inc. , which owns gas production and pipelines, said it favore=
d the measure but asked FERC to give industry enough lead time to change th=
eir systems to accommodate it. The company also asked FERC to "grandfather"=
 existing capacity arrangements to exempt them from the requirements.=20
Gas producers said they welcomed the proposed change in pipeline scheduling=
 rules.=20
The American Gas Association, which represents major gas producers, said th=
e measure would boost competition in the U.S. natural gas market. The chang=
es would also "better ensure continued reliability of natural gas service, =
enhance daily balancing abilities and make more capacity available on the i=
nterstate grid," the group said.

Dynegy Confirms -3: Deal May Be Cut More Than 40% -WSJ

11/27/2001=20
Dow Jones News Service=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar=
 with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to =
cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 bil=
lion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report.=
=20
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron sha=
res changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%.=20
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to rece=
ive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or abo=
ut $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price.=20
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dyn=
egy share.=20
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talk=
s to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to su=
pport its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its deb=
t, which totals about $13 billion.=20
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncerta=
in how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent.=20
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost =
401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, whic=
h has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enr=
on "locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sel=
l the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses.=20
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount=
 of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek =
a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said.=20
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause th=
at allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pendin=
g"' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked.=20
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits =
have been filed against Enron.=20

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers, But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to f=
ind willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the on=
e-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according t=
o market sources.=20
"It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying f=
rom it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutc=
h/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan=
 Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The brok=
er estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of wha=
t it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot g=
as and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for i=
t a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer.=20
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and B=
P PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. D=
ynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that d=
eal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California=
 utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) =
also are trading with Enron.=20
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very l=
imited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals =
done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), =
Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broke=
r said.=20
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at pric=
es lower than Enron was offering.=20
"They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader.=20
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions=20

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but =
not to 25% of the one-month-ago level.=20
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.=
8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume d=
ata for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily informatio=
n two weeks ago.=20
"We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day =
rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of d=
aily volatility," Thode said.=20
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee=
 to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to tr=
ansact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the compa=
nies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved =
and completed.=20
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as conce=
rns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left =
its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt.=20
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following th=
e late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities E=
xchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month=
 ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fea=
r that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based=
 on the quarterly filing.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch ab=
ove speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrad=
e, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit r=
ating "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depe=
nds on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.=20

SMARTMONEY.COM: Common Sense: Joining The Deal Dance

I KNOW IT'S been hard, but if you've been able to divert yourself from the =
amazing news out of Afghanistan this past week, you may have noticed some i=
mportant merger stories: trouble in the Compaq Computer (CPQ)- Hewlett-Pack=
ard (HWP) deal, Dynegy's (DYN) bid for Enron (ENE), and, on Monday, the ann=
ouncement of Phillips Petroleum's (P) proposed merger with Conoco (COC) to =
create the world's sixth-largest oil company.=20
The Phillips-Conoco merger is an excellent example of what economists call =
horizontal integration - the merger of two companies in the same business, =
in this case, oil and gas. As an investor, I love these combinations, even =
though as a citizen I'm often troubled by antitrust concerns. Investors who=
 engage in what's called merger arbitrage, or risk arbitrage, which gained =
fame and notoriety in the 1980s, tend to sell stock in the acquiring compan=
y, and buy the stock of the company being acquired. Though they're far less=
 conspicuous now, risk arbitrageurs play a prominent role in many hedge fun=
ds. The strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns ar=
e determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstanc=
es of particular deals. Successful risk-arbitrage hedge funds typically ear=
n 12% to 20% a year in good markets and bad.=20
Individual investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own, simply by buy=
ing stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through. Bec=
ause of the risk that it won't (either because of regulatory hurdles or mar=
ket reaction), these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition =
price. But few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to ke=
ep up with every twist in these deals, let alone investing in enough of the=
m to have a reasonably diversified portfolio. I know I don't.=20
Instead, for long-term investors I often recommend buying the stock of the =
acquiring company. In this latest instance, that would be Phillips. In simi=
lar circumstances, I have had good luck buying Exxon after it launched its =
bid for Mobil to form Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Chevron after it acquired Texa=
co to become ChevronTexaco (CVX). Their stocks were down on the news, but l=
ater recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from cost-cutting and ec=
onomies of scale, not to mention reduced competition. Even if the deal fail=
s, you aren't stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was =
announced. Honeywell (HON) investors will know only too well what I mean. I=
 still consider it outrageous that the European Community blocked General E=
lectric's (GE) acquisition of Honeywell, but when the deal fell through, GE=
 investors were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the =
target.=20
So far, the Phillips-Conoco deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slight=
ly after the merger was announced, which suggests that other investors have=
 caught on to the same phenomenon I've noticed. But even without a built-in=
 merger premium, I'm enthusiastic about the energy sector. True, oil stocks=
 have dropped further since I last recommended them, before the calamitous =
events of Sept. 11. With talk of an out-and-out price war breaking out and =
dire predictions of $10-a-barrel oil, it's no wonder. But it's exactly when=
 prospects in the oil patch look their worst that it's the time to buy thes=
e stocks. If there is indeed a global economic recovery next year, as seems=
 ever more likely, oil prices will rise. So I recommend Phillips both as a =
merger play and as a timely investment in the energy sector.=20
Which brings me to Enron. I'm glad I warned readers away from this former h=
ighflying natural-gas, pipeline and energy-trading concern, since its stock=
 continued to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from Dynegy=
. This isn't exactly a horizontal merger, since Dynegy isn't a big factor i=
n energy trading, but it will combine the two companies' pipelines and natu=
ral-gas holdings. The market reaction to this deal was very unusual, since =
shares of Dynegy, the acquiring company, jumped 14% on the news. Enron move=
d up just 7%. This is the opposite of what's supposed to happen, but then, =
nothing about Enron has been typical. The market seems to be saying that it=
 likes the deal, but doubts it will go through, a prospect enhanced by the =
large breakup fee Dynegy will enjoy if it's horrified by what it discovers =
in Enron's still-mysterious books. Personally, I'm sitting this one out, bu=
t there may be an arbitrage opportunity in Enron for risk-tolerant investor=
s. If the deal goes through (and I think it will), Enron shareholders will =
receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy for each share of Enron. That's worth over $=
11 a share at current prices, yet Enron closed Tuesday at just $7, down 23%=
 after a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are start=
ing to rattle its financial structure. So while Enron's position is becomin=
g increasingly precarious, this deal could make for a nice return. And it's=
 still potentially a very good bet for Dynegy - one that will add to its na=
tural-gas reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders, ass=
uming it can hold on to Enron's talented but now disgruntled employees. Fin=
ally, there's the spectacle of the founding Hewlett and Packard families tu=
rning against H-P's proposed acquisition of Compaq on the grounds that prop=
osed economies of scale - read layoffs - run counter to the spirit of the c=
ompany's founders, who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fire=
d anyone except for cause. The dissidents acknowledged that they have littl=
e or no business and managerial experience themselves, although they are re=
presented on H-P's board. Forgive me if I seem impatient with these benefic=
iaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds, but this reasoning is absurd.=
 However much we might sympathize with their concern for employee well-bein=
g, the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees' needs with=
 those of other constituencies, especially the shareholders. Otherwise, a c=
ompany will suffer far more dire consequences, including bankruptcy or a fo=
rced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any merger-=
related layoffs. I have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the propo=
sed H-P-Compaq merger. That the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary =
on how far the fortunes of these once-great companies have fallen. That sai=
d, the merger still makes sense, and it's far better for shareholders than =
if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spiral=
s. I owned both stocks until last week, when I sold my small position in Co=
mpaq. I did this primarily to realize a tax loss (more on tax-loss selling =
next week), but also because I wouldn't want to own it if the deal falls th=
rough. I'm holding on to my larger position in H-P. I think the deal will b=
e completed, despite the melodrama of family opposition. Eventually, I beli=
eve both stocks will benefit, and patient investors might want to buy one o=
r both companies on any weakness. -----------------------------------------=
----------------------------------- ---- Reasons for Thankfulness The stunn=

Is it a paradox that as a calamitous 2001 nears an end, I feel more thankfu=

l with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 b=
ln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said.=20
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading u=

Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dyne=

ies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp =
fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks.=20
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday tha=
t would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of the=

As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised.=20
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clau=

As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing=
 with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly co=

"Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fade=

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and =
savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement =
has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing =
bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part=
 to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrou=
nding the once mighty energy trader.=20
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revise=
d down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to ta=
ke more risks, looking to place trades on the deal.=20
"We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge=
 fund.=20
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a comb=
ination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enro=
n's shares with a long position in some of its bonds.=20
"People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against =
it," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're =
still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equ=
ity sides."=20
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing the=
m later by purchasing them at a lower price.=20
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long=
 positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical=
 about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and=
 large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.=20
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt=
 market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," s=
aid a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enr=
on's bonds.=20
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seve=
n points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enr=
on and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower pr=
ice. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on=
 the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday.=20
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.268=
5 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to =
the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new rati=
o is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of=
 Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswir=
es story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value E=
nron at less than $6 a share.=20
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier fo=
r hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds.=20
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more tha=
n $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose =
only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ra=
tio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potenti=
al by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is see=
n by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That=
 means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amoun=
t.=20
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value o=
f Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about=
 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron s=
tock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new co=
nversion ratio of 0.15.=20
"A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New Y=
ork bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen =
more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."=20
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors a=
re likely to wait for more news before taking a position.=20
"We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is s=
o volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large Ne=

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.



ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.

Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.

Getting it done
______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done.

"I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle."

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

"Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache."

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "the
parties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of the
deal.

Enron In Free Fall=20
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.=
com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET=20

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stand=
s, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman K=
enneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George =
W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by riv=
al Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling.=20

Dynegy's buyout of Enron was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as t=
he deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccur=
ate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four =
years.=20

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believ=
e it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron sha=
res down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 =
billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago.=20

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, seve=
ral top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enro=
n's former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons."=
=20

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a =
series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 =
million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agree=
ment that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over =
Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are s=
ure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on e=
xecutives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and t=
he exercise of stock options in 2000 alone.=20

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival wi=
th 2000 revenue of $101 billion.=20

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis =
of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide ener=
gy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and ele=
ctricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the com=
pany's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear no=
w is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidatio=
n that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills.=20

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and tha=
t number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their r=
atings on Enron debt.=20

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco may pump billions of dollars into Enr=
on's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly u=
ndergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and ene=
rgy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself.=20

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and se=
rvices companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers=
 energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk man=
agement services to customers around the world." While all this may be true=
, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing reven=
ue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors.=20

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that r=
evenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. M=
ost of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sol=
d as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm.=20

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball se=
ason, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. B=
y 2002, Enron Field may need a new name.=20

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but i=
t means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of Inte=
rNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company E=
nteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Ent=
eron means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go=
 with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in te=
rms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.


Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its a=
cquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remain=
s too risky.=20
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to r=
estructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the ne=
gotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes =
a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional f=
unding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.=20
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they conti=
nue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares=
 recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares change=
d hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%.=20
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.268=
5 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trad=
ing levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price.=20
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an=
 exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion=
.=20
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability =
to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal move=
s toward completion, the person said.=20
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it wi=
ll take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known a=
s arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fash=
ion.=20
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the ac=
quiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders h=
ope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer.=
=20
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accus=
tomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way.=20
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and =
potentially push Enron into bankruptcy.=20
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to r=
ealize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts in=
to off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its =
former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
"There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who sai=
d there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet=
 to come from Enron.=20

US Physical Gas Prices End Up On Short-Term Cold

11/27/2001=20
Dow Jones Energy Service=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
HOUSTON (Dow Jones))--U.S. natural gas physical prices rose Tuesday, booste=
d by short-term cold weather pushing into the Midcontinent and Texas, trade=
rs said.=20
But little of that colder air - or demand - reached the Northeast and East =
Coast, traders said.=20
"The Texas market was the big driver," said one Gulf Coast trader. "The Dal=
las market was buying." He said Waha gas in the Western Texas hub was tradi=
ng at a premium to the benchmark Henry Hub.=20
Gas was being turned back in the Northeast and East Coast and "Texas was bu=
rning it," he said. The cold is expected to last into the weekend, he said.=
=20
Traders said the physical gas-futures spread of nearly $1 per million Briti=
sh thermal units below the New York Mercantile Exchange's December futures =
contract seen on Monday eased slightly to about 70 cents, but traders still=
 look for sustained cold in December to bring prices back to par.=20
Traders still pointed to some constrictions in eastern U.S. pipelines. Pric=
ing was "all over the place" in wide variances, a trader who works New York=
 pipelines said.=20
In the West, prices also strengthened on the cooler temperatures, traders s=
aid.=20
Traders also avoided doing physical gas deals with Enron Corp., whose merge=
r with Dynegy Inc. was reportedly being renegotiated. In the meantime, seve=
ral traders said Enron's gas bids and offers were well above pricing seen o=
n other boards, and were "out of the market."=20
December goes off the board Wednesday. It settled at $2.606 per million Bri=
tish thermal units, down 9.0 cents.=20
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $1.72-$2.09/MMB=
tu, unchanged on the bid, up 19 cents on the offer. First-of-month November=
 index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said.=20
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.68=
-$2.02/MMBtu range, down 4 cents on the bid, up 14 cents on the offer. Nove=
mber first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said.=20
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins =
delivery to Southern California lines, buyers paid $2.35-$2.62/MMBtu, up 12=
 cents-32 cents. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu.=20
At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.11-$2.40/MMBtu, up 33 cents-3=
5 cents. November index is $3.01/MMBtu. Houston Ship Channel rose 30 cents-=
33 cents to $2.17-$2.39/MMBtu. Index is $3.12/MMBtu.=20
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $2.17-$2.45/MMBtu, up 25 cents-29 cents.=
 November index is $2.86/MMBtu.=20

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on
the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on
Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on
monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with
Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review
procedures for any changes.

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough
to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance
from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could
reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will
review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious
to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of
This email.

Thanks Lynn

It sounds as if, despite the concerns we had earlier in the week, it is alright to go ahead and do a full refresh of the model office environment, including TSS.  Larry's testing database is totally separate and is not set to get automatically updated.

Thanks!

Access through the start menu has been restored.  We will be documenting the incident along with the final solution and will forward the information to you.

Subject:	All tests were NOT successfully executed


All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

Since we are already working on a short term solution to stop the 'bleeding' caused by the Schedule Quantities Report  fiasco, i would like for us to setup a project and a project plan for migrating all TMS report out of Crystal to Business Objects.

Thanks

Lisa,

I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?

FYI


The prepayment invoices for PGE for December are as follows:

contract 21175  $   499,410.00
contract 21165  $1,277,355.00

The due date on these invoices is November 26th; however, I suspect that the funds will be wired to TW on November 21st.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the "macro" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

Dari,

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.

We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

I could also do it Thursday morning early---I have to leave by 10:00 a.m. Lynn is out of town until next Wednesday, but  I'm sure she will be checking her e:mails. thanks. sj

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

Of course I'm happy to serve. The best for me would be Wednesday afternoon beginning at 2 or 2:30. I will already be in Omaha. I could also do it Thursday morning early---I have to leave by 10:00 a.m. Lynn is out of town until next Wednesday, but  I'm sure she will be checking her e:mails. thanks. sj

Subject:	SLA Settlement



As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

	Tom, we would be glad to do a timeline review.  I will be out of town until next Wednesday.
	
	John, would you please give Tom a call and work with Ava to set up a time for us to review.
	Tom, did a "brown bag" session work for you guys from 11:30 to 1:00?  If so, we can go
	that route again.
	
	Thanks. Lynn

Charlie sent me the following message.
"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

Dari,

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.

We have tenatively scheduled a meeting with Lynn to discuss the problems we are experiencing with Amarillo Natural Gas.  The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe!  

Date: Monday, Oct. 29th
Time: 9:00 am
Place: Lynn's Office

Any questions, please let me know.

Randy

Cara worked evenings with me Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  She has done well learning the evening routine.  She has taken lots of notes and seems to understand what needs to be done.  The area she still has concerns with is: El Paso - when is it a loop and when is it going to or from TW.  So be sure to let her know if there are any.

I let her do everything Saturday evening and with the exception of a couple of questions, she soloed.  I feel she will do fine on evenings starting Wednesday, the 26th.

John, please forward this note to anyone who previously had VPN access.  We would like to focus on reestablishing their access first.  Then, we can address any new requests after that.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.


We have been notified that in order to reestablish our VPN access, we must submit an eRequest.   Instructions for completing the eRequest are on the Solution Center website under Quick Reference on the left, and the link to the eRequest system is on the right side of the page.  Please assure that you check the manager's name that appears in the Manager Approval blank.  If this information is not correct, your request will be rejected. 

If you need any assistance, please give us a call at X54745.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

FYI - The NNG and TW customer team reps have called all of their counterparts to remind/alert/ask them to doublecheck to ensure their accounts payable and treasury people have Citibank set up as our bank to receive their wire payments this week.  We are feeling pretty good about our notification process...  We will distribute control reports to management.

All,
We are in the process of undertaking a proof of concept project for using Business Object to produce the existing TMS reports in place of Crystal Reports.  Jennifer Lowry along with Andriy Mysyk will be providing project management services. Andriy and Matthew Minyard will provide Business Object expertise whereas Jennifer will provide Smalltalk support for this project.

Jennifer and Andriy are in the process of putting together a work/project plan.

Thanks

	Please provide comments to the attached draft posting  "Reminder of Gas Quality Requirements" The goal is to make sure everyone understands there "can be" quality issues - if something occurs, don't want it to be a surprise.

Importance:	High


I've checked the ISC about the inability to view pay information via eHRonline this morning.  They are having a problem with the electronic pay advice function.  The recorded message says that there will be resolution to the problem by noon.  It did not mention anything about those receiving a paper copy of their pay advice so I'm assuming (not always a good idea) that those will come in the morning mail run.  I'll check later and try to get an update for you.
