Please review this letter to see if it is accurate. It would be best to fax it today, if possible.

Is Ed going to sign this?

Eric:

I do not have a concern about the credit quality of Reliant concerning this transaction.
Enron does have performance risk, but it seems minimal and I would recommend that we pre-pay Reliant the $22,500.

Regards,
Tom Moran

Kay/Tom,

I need legal and credit sign-off for ENA to pre-pay Reliant for gas needed to perform under the City of Tallahassee contract (approx $25 MM in the money to Enron).

The pre-pay would be for 2,000 mmbtu/day x 5 days x Gas Daily +.05 (appox $2.25) = $22,500

This would give us 5 days worth of swing gas pre-paid with Reliant.

Questions:
Are you concerned about Credit?
Are you concerned about the risk they may take our money and not perform by claiming an offset against other monies owed by ENA?
Kay, where can I find you to get you the contract to review?

Please get back to us today as we need to get the "Cash Approval Sheet" to the credit committee this afternoon.

Thanks so much,

Eric

PS- Chris is also working on another "back-up" supplier for this deal.

I have requested the following payments to made to Reliant on Thur, 3/28/02.

 Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim Taylor yesterday.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00 (normal weekly prepay).
Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

Please let me know if anyone has questions.

Thanks

P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the worksheet please.

Thanks

Per David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.  Using my calculation down below, we paid Dominion (and billed Tallahassee) for 100,000 dth.  I would like to verify that Tallahassee received 104,793 dth, then bill Tallahassee for the additional 4,793 dth and pay Dominion for the same amount.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
thx

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Ed, 

There was an outage on MOPS in Feb 2002 that impacted how much gas ENA received from Dominion (Louis Dreyfus deal #30468).  We paid Dominion for 100,000 dth and we invoiced Tallahassee for 100,000 dth.   After the month was over, we discovered that we actually received 104,793 dth.  We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it.  Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562].  Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].

If yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.

Subject:	RE: Dominion prepay for City of Tallahassee deal for March 2002

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Here is the update on the supply for City of Tallahassee:

Christina Sanchez spoke with BP Amoco who is supplying Dominion the gas the Dominion is selling to ENA.  They told her the pipeline believes at the earliest maintenance will be done by Friday.  Christina has contacted Pam McCullers at City of Tall to let her know.  Reliant is still supplying the swing piece with the expectation of the 9th and 10th.  City of Tall did not mention the interruptions to Christina.  Chris has been buying this gas on a weekly basis with a prepayment of $20,000.00 a week.  I also told Christina to follow up with Pam to make sure they have received the Force Majeure letter.

Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.

This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 = 	$32,700.00
			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 = 	$957,000.00
					Total Prepayment		$989,700.00

I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

Subject:	 Gas flow and prepayment schedule through 3/28/02


I have requested the following payments to made to Reliant on Thur, 3/28/02.

 Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim Taylor yesterday.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00 (normal weekly prepay).
Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

Please let me know if anyone has questions.

Thanks

P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the worksheet please.

Thanks

Hi Pete,

Wanted to recap our conversation yesterday, update you on our timing and get you my contact information.

Regarding a possible settlement, it appears to me that this is a concept that you have considered and are willing to pursue.  We will have a valuation of the contract for you Monday.  It is my suggestion that you review the proposal, make sure that you agree with the outstanding transactions and complete your own valuation.  Once we have agreed on the universe of transactions, you and I will discuss and finalize a settlement amount that we are comfortable will be approved by the creditor committee and bankruptcy judge.

>From this point, Enron will begin the process of filing a motion for settlement and schedule an appropriate hearing date for the judge to rule.  Please seek bankruptcy council to determine if it will be necessary for a representative from your company to attend and, as well, to be comfortable with the process.

Finally, we will provide you a sample Release Letter for your review.  We will seek your comments, if any, prior to the hearing date.  After the settlement motion is filed, we would ask that there are no more document or value negotiations in order to expedite closure.

All of that said, concurrently, in case you and I are not able to reach agreement on a settlement amount, we are going to take the first step in an auction process.  This means that I am going to send you a procedural Notice of an anticipated auction to sell your contract as we discussed yesterday.  It is our desire to settle this prior to an auction taking place.  The settlement process is our preferred route of resolution.  Please call me if you have any questions regarding this.

Please, call me with any questions and let's work hard at keeping an open dialog so that we can resolve this to both of our mutual benefits.  I have included my contact information at the end of this email-- if you could return this email with your mailing address, I would appreciate it.  Also, I look forward to working with you through this process, and finally, thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Mike Bridges

Gentlemen,

	Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow,
June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas
to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire
month of June.  Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract
for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement.  In any case,
Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so
that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives. 

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Roger McDonald

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.  

Kay

The Tallahassee deal still has value so we want the Dominion deal to stay in place.  I'm concerned about the 1st because all the money needs to be wired tomorrow.  At this point, I believe Dominion should supply the gas for April at the contract price regardless.

Let me know where we stand with Dominion by 1:30 PM today.

Subject:	Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Subject:	Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Chris,

Pam at the City of Tallahassee sent me her volume reports for February 2002.
There are two adjustments that will be made to their invoice.

The base volume will be increased from 100,000 dth to 104,793 dth.
This will increase our supply with Dominion which I believe you have been informed
by Dominion as well.
The Swing gas for 2/27/02 will be reduced by 450 to 1,550 due to an operational scheduling cut
from the Reliant pool.  The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on
the original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee
in the amount of $14,570.72.  I will let you know when payment is received on this adjustment.

Don't forget my State of Florida adjustments!

Thanks,
Max

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.

Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.

Ed, 

There was an outage on MOPS in Feb 2002 that impacted how much gas ENA received from Dominion (Louis Dreyfus deal #30468).  We paid Dominion for 100,000 dth and we invoiced Tallahassee for 100,000 dth.   After the month was over, we discovered that we actually received 104,793 dth.  We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it.  Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562].  Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].

If yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.

Per David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.  Using my calculation down below, we paid Dominion (and billed Tallahassee) for 100,000 dth.  I would like to verify that Tallahassee received 104,793 dth, then bill Tallahassee for the additional 4,793 dth and pay Dominion for the same amount.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Dominion prepay for City of Tallahassee deal for March 2002

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.

I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers  - asking for Roger's phone number and title.

Subject:	Florida swing supplier

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Shemin,

Please review and approve at your convenience.  I modified the document that was fully vetted for the financial gas auction for use in this auction.  We are planning on sending these Monday.

Let me know if there is any problems.

FYI, looking forward, we will need to start work on the PSA and Assignment docs.

Per David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.  Using my calculation down below, we paid Dominion (and billed Tallahassee) for 100,000 dth.  I would like to verify that Tallahassee received 104,793 dth, then bill Tallahassee for the additional 4,793 dth and pay Dominion for the same amount.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

Per yesterday's curves, Phil is showing that Tallahassee has a MTM value of $9,798,771.  Earlier, my cash requests showed a value of $1,500,000 as of 3/26/02.  

Phil's analysis below shows that the value of the Tallahassee deal was $3,388,467 using the curves on 3/26/02.  While the curve prices for 5/2002 through 10/2003 have increased, curve prices beyond 10/2003 have decreased.

I will attach Phil's worksheet showing current deal values to my cash request in the future.

I keep track of Tallahassee's swing volumes in this worksheet ==>  o:gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/city of tallahassee/tallahassee swing cash flow.xls, tab "actual gas flows".

FYI - if I recall Tallahassee is supposed to take a minimum of 35% of the swing gas.  Through May 2, 2002, Tallahassee has called on 126,695 dth (52%) which is greater than the minimum requirement.

Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.

I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers  - asking for Roger's phone number and title.

Roger/Pat, et al: Should we be drafting an emergency motion to the Bankrupcy Court for rejection of this contract, such motion being prompted by Enron's impending  failure of performance?  I would think that we at least need to have a plan for advising the Court of any intention we have to try to terminate this contract for cause. I am concerned that the Court may take the following view: (i) Enron has just advised us that it values this contract at over $2 million, so it presumably it does not want to terminate it for nothing; (ii) under the terms of the contract, our remedy for non-performance is arguably the right to be made whole for our incremental costs of replacing the underlivered gas supply, rather than contract termination, and there is no indication Enron, as debtor-in-possession, does not intend to honor that obligation.  We probably need Jason's input here, and in any event to proceed carefully before throwing down the gauntlet. Doug

>>> "McDonald, Roger" <McDonalR@talgov.com> 05/31 11:57 AM >>>
Gentlemen,

	Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow,
June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas
to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire
month of June.  Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract
for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement.  In any case,
Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so
that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives. 

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Gentlemen,

	It is my understanding that Enron Representative Chris German
informed Tallahassee Representative Pam McCullers, earlier this morning that
Enron would not be scheduling gas to Tallahassee pursuant to subject
agreement for the month of June.  If this is indeed the case and Enron does
not schedule gas with Tallahassee by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Prevailing Time
tomorrow, May 31, 2002, Tallahassee will seek replacement supplies from
alternative sources.

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Roger McDonald

My telephone conversations with Pam McCullers at the City Of Tallahassee

9:00 AM.  I told Pam McCullers (Tallahassee) that ENA will not be supplying Tallahassee with gas for June 2002.

10:30 AM.  Pam McCullers asked me what the chances are that ENA will call Tallahassee tomorrow to serve the deal for June 2002.  I just told Pam that in today's world anything is possible.  When Pam asked me why we were not serving the contract, I told her that the decision not to supply Tallahassee with gas came from Ed McMichael and that I was not involved in those decisions.


Pam didn't seem upset in either phone call but I also worked diligently to change the conversation to other topics on both conversations, such as my post petition nursing career or working my way up the ladder at Chic Fil A.

Ed, Mike, I am assuming that you two will address all the activity related to the Tallahassee contract going forward.  Let me know if there is something you need me or Robin to do.

Also, Pam Alley at Tallahassee (backup for Pam McCullers) would like for us to let Tallahassee know by 8:00 AM everyday what we are going to do for the next gas day.  It sounds like Tallahassee has not bought any base load supply to replace this gas.

Roger/Pat, et al: Should we be drafting an emergency motion to the Bankrupcy Court for rejection of this contract, such motion being prompted by Enron's impending  failure of performance?  I would think that we at least need to have a plan for advising the Court of any intention we have to try to terminate this contract for cause. I am concerned that the Court may take the following view: (i) Enron has just advised us that it values this contract at over $2 million, so it presumably it does not want to terminate it for nothing; (ii) under the terms of the contract, our remedy for non-performance is arguably the right to be made whole for our incremental costs of replacing the underlivered gas supply, rather than contract termination, and there is no indication Enron, as debtor-in-possession, does not intend to honor that obligation.  We probably need Jason's input here, and in any event to proceed carefully before throwing down the gauntlet. Doug

Gentlemen,

	Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow,
June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas
to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire
month of June.  Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract
for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement.  In any case,
Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so
that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives. 

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.

I purchased the 10,000 dth gas from Reliant for the month.  The $70,000.00 wire needs to be revised to $989,700.00.

I left a revised cash request on Doug's desk.

I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Should I buy the 13,000 dth per day for Tallahassee for June 2002?  I would like to try to get gas at the contract point (MOPS).  That worked out well this month due to all the constraints on the pipeline.

Drew,
We MAY need to make a payment for June gas of appx. $1.3MM for City of Tallahassee, which is on the gas cash forecast.  However, I am not certain that we will be buying the gas.  That decision will be made tomorrow, so please stay ready and we will inform you once we decide.  If you have any questions, please ask.
