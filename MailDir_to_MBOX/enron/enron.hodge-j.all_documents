     By DAVID FLESHLER Sun-Sentinel
     Web-posted: 9:54 p.m. Mar. 6, 2001

     The power plant proposed for Pompano Beach moved a step Tuesday toward
     being built, as the state's air-quality regulators announced plans to
     issue a construction permit.
        The state Department of Environmental Protection this week will
     publish notices of its intent to grant the permit to Enron Corp.,
     which is facing vigorous opposition to its plans for a 510-megawatt
     plant just east of Florida's Turnpike. The notices will trigger a
     30-day comment period, with the final decision likely a month or two
     after that.
        The department made the decision after a lengthy review that showed
     the plant would have little impact on the region's air quality, said
     Alvaro Linero, the DEP administrator who handled the permit
     application.
        Relying on clean natural gas as its primary fuel, the plant would
     emit far less pollution than other power plants in the area, he said.
     Its hot gases would soar upward from the 80-foot stacks, so that
     neighborhoods near the plant would experience no more pollution than
     other neighborhoods. And there are commitments on its operating
     schedule and fuel quality that will reduce its environmental impact,
     he said.
        "They showed they will have a fairly minimal impact on air quality
     in the area and will be using the best available control technology,"
     Linero said.
        The plant would operate as a "peaking" plant, meaning it would go
     into service only when a public utility needed a backup source of
     power. Its permit would allow it to operate a maximum of 3,500 hours a
     year, or just under 10 hours a day.
        The plant would emit up to 573 tons a year of nitrogen oxide, a key
     cause of smog, according to the DEP analysis. It would emit up to 165
     tons a year of sulfur dioxide, which generates fine particles that can
     lodge deep in the lungs. Both pollutants can aggravate respiratory
     problems, such as asthma and emphysema.
        But Linero said the amounts would be minimal compared to the total
     amount of pollution in the region. The plant at Port Everglades, for
     example, emits far more of both pollutants. And motor vehicles
     accounted for 32,295 tons of nitrogen oxide in 1997, when Broward
     County last did a full air pollution inventory, according to county
     records.
        A key section of the proposed permit concerns diesel fuel, which
     the company plans to use when its supply of natural gas is
     interrupted. Diesel fuel emits much more pollution than natural gas,
     but the company made some commitments to reduce the effects, Linero
     said.
        It agreed to limit its diesel use to 1,000 hours a year, down from
     its original proposal of 1,500 hours. And for every hour of diesel
     operation over 250 hours, it will reduce its total annual operations
     by two hours. For example, if it uses its maximum 1,000 hours of
     diesel fuel, it will operate the plant for a total of only 2,000 hours
     for the year. The diesel fuel will be high-quality, low-sulfur fuel,
     Linero said.
        "We negotiated with the company to try to minimize the amount of
     diesel fuel usage and maximize the usage of natural gas," he said. "We
     also reviewed the pollution-control equipment that is designed into
     these units and determined that it meets best-available control
     technology."
        The DEP permit represents one of the major hurdles the company
     faces. The other is the application to rezone the 28-acre site for the
     plant. The City Commission is expected to vote next month on whether
     to change the land's zoning from industrial to utility.
        The project faces heavy opposition in Margate, Coconut Creek and
     some sections of Pompano Beach. Nothing that DEP said on Tuesday gave
     opponents any comfort.
        Even if the plant would emit less nitrogen oxide than other plants,
     they said, it would still be a new source of pollution. Even if the
     company agrees to limit its hours and operate it as a peaking plant,
     they said, those restrictions could change once the plant is in place.
     And they said the state had an unimpressive track record on
     environmental protection.
        "The state also approved the deposit of ash in Pompano Beach and
     they also approved the canker eradication program, where healthy trees
     were cut down," said Pompano Beach Commissioner Kay McGinn. "So they
     don't have much credibility."
        Coconut Creek Commissioner Jim Waldman said the plant would
     eventually be able to throw off restrictions on its use and operate as
     a full-time power plant.
        "I don't think it's going to be operated the way it's been applied
     for," he said. "I don't think it's just going to be a peaking plant. I
     think it's going to be operating at capacity. Once it's there, it will
     be easier for the state to allow it to be used as a regular source of
     energy. And I don't think the proper controls will be there at the
     time."
        Officials at Enron, a multinational company based in Houston, said
     the state's decision came as little surprise, since they had been
     negotiating various restrictions on the plant's operations in order to
     win approval.
        "It's a permit that DEP ought to be proud of," said Eric Thode, a
     spokesman for the company. "It's a very stringent permit."
        The department will accept comments on the proposed permit at a
     public meeting from 7:30 to 9 p.m. on March 26 at the Pompano Beach
     Civic Center.
        Written comments may be submitted to: A.A. Linero, Florida
     Department of Environmental Protection, 2600 Blairstone Road,
     Tallahassee, FL 32399.

How are you/maybe one day the OSU football coach will know how to deal with 
that team from the north!  I'm in a group at ees that is gradually 
progressing towards a contract briefing system; once we decide on the 
software and system ( i went to a global contract presentation which didn't 
bring back only bad memories!).  I know that we will end up with a similar 
document to what was used (and is still used i believe) in ENA with some 
differences due to the disparate types of customers.   Do you have a word 
version (even an older document would be fine) of that template?   I 
understand that now the ENA briefing system is 'online'.

location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob

Gil,

Note that our forward curves for Transco Zone 5 (summer only) show a basis of 
$.42.  Assuming a $5.00 gas price, the commodity and fuel is $.2437 making 
Piedmont's capacity worth $.1763.  So Keith's current bid of $.19 is in the 
ballpark.  I'm still waiting to hear back from LG&E.   Southern Co. plans on 
getting back with me on this early next week as is Tenaska/PECO as you know.

Here is comments from Brad on his initial assessment of Tennergy.  He is 
working with Williams now to see if his flow analysis is accurate.  We should 
know from Williams shortly and therefore will need to get a handle on how 
much additional transport we will need.

Subject: Load Analysis  

>From the best that I can tell from a GE LM600 catalog, the fuel rate for one 
of these units under average conditions will be 8.4 MMCFD.  The capacity of 
these two 8" lines is between 40-44 MMCFD, but the LDC load number peaks up 
to 25 MMCFD in September.  If you look at just June, July and August, then 
it's still 22 MMCFD.  If the fuel rates from the catalog are correct at 8.4 
MMCFD/unit, then we are looking at 17 MMCFD for two LM6000 units.  This puts 
us at utilizing from 39 MMCFD to 42 MMCFD of a system that has between 40-44 
MMCFD total capacity.  This is way too close for comfort, we need to tighten 
both our LM6000 fuel numbers, our system capacity numbers and the LDC load 
numbers.  You need to get confirmation on what the maximum fuel rate will be 
for two of these units.  I need to get with Jackson Utility to see if their 
peak hour numbers are different from the daily numbers, I'm betting that they 
are.  I need to build a more detailed model of the two 8" pipelines with the 
LDC loads coming off at the right mileposts, with correct efficiency factors 
for the pipe.  I'll get the correct efficiency factors for the pipe by 
simulating an actual flow period on their system.  I'm hoping that they have 
good historical numbers or are willing to gather data on a typical day for me 
to simulate.  I can take my simulation package up to Tennessee and fine tune 
everything, if needed, or do it here in Houston with email and phone.

More than half of the outstanding assignments are purchase contracts with no 
delivery exposure as well.  I agreed with Chip Hollands to reduce the gty by 
100MM.  I believe the original was 275MM, with 50MM-75MM allocated to the 
indemnity?  He will have their attorneys contact you with the amendment.  
Once Bryce completes  his valuation, we will be able to determine if further 
reductions are possible.  Please call if you have questions.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This

is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any

CES Transactions (Deal Extract) 10/1/00 - forward
(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been

"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Andrew--

Looks good to me.  I have a question/comment on #3.  When we have talked to
PP&L, it was understanding that if you are buying power from the utility, it
was a sole-serve type of arrangement (you couldn't buy power on the grid).
If this is the case, is there a way that another Enron affiliate or maybe
your wholesale group could perform a swap with the power or the financials
to make it look like we are not taking power from the utility and selling it
in the market?

Corey

Subject: Stagecoach - Going Forward



Hey all,

I thought I would put down the steps that need to be done in moving forward
with the Stagecoach deal.  If there is anything I missed, please let me
know.

1. Need to recalculate deal as a 10-year term with updated pricing.

2. Need to explore possibility of receiving gas volumes in the Northern
Storage facility.  Understand that storage and withdrawal fees would apply.

3. Need to address the supply of power during the summer months of June
July and August that would provide maximum optionality for both
participants.  Will explore at least 2 scenarios: First, a minimum load
factor scenario in which power could be interrupted and sold back into the
market with Enron and El Paso sharing in the realized margin, and second, a
separate contract that provided El Paso with the ability to call on power
when they desire to run the electric compressor during those months.  This
could be the most challenging aspect of the deal, so please forward any
other ideas or suggestions.

4. Need to produce operating bands for load factors and corresponding heat
rates.  This includes exploring a ratcheting demand charge where annual
charge could be reduced and operation above a certain load factor would
result in pass through charges.

Once again, thanks to all for a very productive and high-energy meeting.
Let's keep the communication flowing so we can put together the best deal
for everyone involved.

Andrew

Hi, John,

Following up my phone call, I am sending a list of curve requests for you on 
the BNY project:

Base Year: 2001

1. Trans Canada:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  
2. Iroquois:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation 
 3. Transco Z1 - Z6:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  

On the Tariff escalation part, based on your inputs, we used 22%, 18%, and 
36% of GDP inflation for TransCanada, Iroquois and Transco, respectively.  
Also, you estimated % increase in Transco Tariff from 2001 to 2007.  

Thanks a lot for your help!

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

Michael

Michael
apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?

Piero

As you are probably aware, your department has been selected to participate 
in Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process and your system has just been 
inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working with 
your department co-ordinator, Sheri Cromwell, to consolidate this information 
to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please call Lee Steele at 713-345-8259.

Important Reminder for ENA Employees

ENA will be rolling out the new Concur Technologies XMS Expense Management 
System March 1, 2001.

XMS will replace the Excel Spreadsheet currently submitted to request expense 
reimbursement. PLEASE NOTE: Those people/teams who have not received training 
are still able to submit reports as before, but teams within ENA are asked to 
transition to XMS as soon as possible following the March 1 target. The 
deadline to transition to XMS is April 1, 2001.

There may be a number of ENA administrative assistants who have already 
received hands-on classroom training and are able to submit both their own 
reports and the reports of those people they support.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

1. XMS Demo
One or more XMS demonstrations had been scheduled in the month of February. 
These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training. 

2. XMS Classroom Training
Please call Maggie Cruz at 3-1816 regarding XMS Training.

3. LEAP online Self-tutorial
Select the following link to access this LEAP self-tutorial.

http://spr2lp1.enron.com/leap_templates/leap_le/login.asp

4. Online documentation
Select the following link to access the written documentation on XMS from 
Concur Technologies.

 http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/xmscheatsheet.doc

Please visit the ISC intranet site for the complete list of documentation on 
XMS.  
XMS also offers an online tour the first time a user logs on.


If you are not able to log into XMS please call the ISC helpdesk 
(713)345-4SAP.

If you have questions about how to use XMS or how to set up 
profiles/workflow, call the Tech Support hotline (713) 853-1411.

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

WK

Peter:

Attached you will find a sample of what ENA submits to Inside FERC.  As you 
can see, it is a download from EOL and does not include counterparty names.

I trust this is of some help to you in your current situation.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

You will receive an e-mail notifying you of your new locker location and 
locker combination prior to re-opening.  If you have any questions, please 
contact the Body Shop Front Desk at  x35547.

Brian:

I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:

 1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price 
alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial
      resolutions to avoid the reopener.

 2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is 
defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.

Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to 
finalize this with you.

Thanks, Jeff

Colleen,

Thanks for this (I guess).  If you would have Mary Ellenberger invoice CES for
this as was done for the National Steel 11/00, 12/00 situation, I will see 
that
Enron is paid for this.

Thanks,

Subject: CES-CDC transaction

Per our discussion, it has been brought to my attention that there is
another CES transaction that ENA has been asked to serve that we have been
unable to find in any of the CES/ENA contracts or paper work.  It is a
three month transaction for 40,000/day at the Columbia Gulf-Mainline Pool,
priced at the Gas Daily Monthly Index plus $.0125.    The transaction is
with the Columbia Distribution Companies:  Columbia Gas of Ohio, Virginia,
Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.  I have sent copies of the agreements
to you via fax.

The good news is that this is an index transaction, so there is no forward
exposure.  The bad news is that, since we did not know about this
transaction prior to the beginning of December, by the time CDC contacted
us (because there was no nomination made), prices had risen considerably
from the first of the month index.  ENA immediately purchased base load
supply to cover this, which at this point has drastically reduced the
exposure; however, ENA will look to CES to cover the difference between the
contract price and the rest of the month pricing as of 12/1/00.

The weighted average price of rest of the month sales at the Henry Hub on
EnronOnLine for 12/1/00 was $6.6125.  Since Henry Hub is a more liquid
location than Columbia Gulf-Mainline, that is how the transaction was
hedged.  The basis difference between Henry Hub and Columbia Mainline (per
the monthly indices) was $.05, making ENA's cost to cover the CDC volumes
$6.6625.  This makes the total dollar amount $706,800  (40,000/d x 31 days
x the difference between the contract price and the cost to cover, or
$.57).

Please call me once you have had a chance to review this with the proper
CES representatives or if you have any questions.  My number is
713/853-5514.  Thanks for your assistance.

and then only on the basis the it is bilateral and for physical 
transactions.  The other 2 concepts:  (ii) modified Market Disruption; or 
(iii) suspension of obligations if Enron is subject to 
judicial/regulatory/legislative action (intended to address Project Stanley), 
are proving to be unworkable concepts.  I believe these latter 2 issues and 
Market Opening Risk for financials will be resolved commercially as something 
that will be lived with.  The traders/marketers have all three concepts 
however.

With repsect to the summary of deals that may be subject to Market Disruption 
as a result of changing legislation or Pool Rules, as we previously 
discussed, I am not sure where that work product was going, other than 
somebody (I believe Lavo) wanted the summary for information purposes (i.e. 
as the deals were already done, the risk is what it is).  If there is some 
other impetus for your report and I need to do something further, please let 
me know.

Many thanks for all of the hard and thoughtful work.

Peter.

Subject: Canadian Power Confirms



	

Attached is a redraft of the three proposed points for inclusion in each of 
financial and physical power confirms.  Please review and advise of any 
further comments or thoughts.  

It is my understanding that it has been decided that Canada wants to negate 
Market Disruption concepts on the basis of changes to EUA or Pool rules.  I 
have also negated force majeure claims on the same basis (typically not apt 
in financial--however, since it could be argued I added it in the financial 
confirm language as well).  Question:  Would we also want to add "any other 
excuse of performance" to this concept?  Such language would afford a broader 
sweep in respect of various claims, however, (i) the sweep may be too broad 
in light of it covering any change in the EUA or Pool rules and (ii) 
ultimately, we may want some flexibility to argue other points.   Advise.

Under Performance Suspension the intent is to carve out the "trade" for 
suspension, while leaving the other aspects of the masters/gtcs in place, 
such as bankruptcy and other termination events.

FYI:  I did talk with CP&L this morning and Mike Pitman's initial feedback 
was that the  $0.25 cent demand was too high.  He said he'll try to get 
everyone together sometime today to get there thoughts.  I'll dicuss it with 
Mark Templeton (the T&E guy) as well.    ONe thing that Mike did mention was 
that maybe if they could get the transport at max rate during the winter and 
then the $0.25 demand during the summer the $0.25 wouldn't appear so strong, 
but that is just  his thought .      Phil what is yours.   I'm assuming if we 
sell it bundled we could recover more that max rate in the winter and you may 
not want to just release the capacity at max.   

I leave today at 11:30 to go to Atlanta and I will not be back in the office 
until Thursday morning.     But I will call this this afternoon and I will 
call Scana as well then I call you.

Thanks.

Jeff, thanks for your note below.  

I heard from Mark Elliott about your trip to London.  Tuesday evening may be 
an opportunity for dinner, since I anticipate to spend from Tuesday afternoon 
to Wednesday afternoon (7-8/11) in London.  Please let me know if that'll 
work for you.

Martin:

It was good hearing from you.  I hope all is well with you.  By the way I 
will be in London next week.  If by chance you are there maybe we could get 
together for dinner.

Anyway, I have looked over your note.  I am not aware of anything we have 
done that looks like what is described in your note.  The closest  that I am 
aware of are two gas management arrangements in Canada which involve Enron 
Canada selling gas of a producer within certain predefined parameters.   The 
things we have done in the States have involved Enron North America Corp. 
having complete control over a customer's assets or in the alternative 
presenting a customer with alternatives that the customer will choose among.

Obviously, the primary issues with these types of arrangements are 
regulatory.  For example, we cannot do the deals that we did in Canada in  
the US because of concern relating to the Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission.

I hope this is of some help.

Jeff

Jeff:

Hope your doing well.  Pls see the note below.  I assume you are the "Houston 
lawyer" referred to therein.  The question is whether to engage in the 
management of a major c/p's power portfolio, partly on a discretionary 
basis.  From the outset I'm sceptical since I spot issues.  Pls let me know 
at your earliest convenience if you have experiences from anything of this 
kind within ENA.  I believe we may have touched upon this issue at your visit 
to Oslo.

Subject: UPM portfolio management

The portfolio management service concept should work as follows:

They should not be required to confirm every trade
We should get approval (maybe on a weekly basis) to transact on their behalf 
i.e. we agree on the taped phone on certain price levels and volumes that we 
are allowed to do. 
we would report (document) every trade instanstly using the risk management 
system
they will have access to the system and can see the trades done (control) at 
any time during the day
the system will give them more control, since they can monitor the MTM value 
of their portfolio at all times

Transactions in practice

example:
we are buying on behalf of UPM

we will get the best available offer in the market
our traders will buy from the market at that price
UPM (Mid Market's portfolio manager) will then buy from the traders at the 
same price 
their trade will be against Enron's book at all times

This way we can get the best available price even when our traders are not 
willing to take the position. So, the deals will "flow" through Enron's book.

If (and when) we get the customer we will set up a structure, where the 
portfolio manager (Mid Market) has access to the outside market. I have 
discussed this with Preben and he has talked to Thor as well. 

Let's try to come up with a contract (draft) that we could live with and that 
is easy to sign for UPM.  As far as I know they have similar arrangements set 
up in the states within Enron. Preben heard this from a Houston lawyer who 
was visiting us a little while ago.


I'll be available on my mobile all weekend should you need my comments/help.


Sami

Jeff, Bill,

I received a call today from Elsa Villareal on the Texas Desk and confirmed 
with OGE's credit that due to the weather, wells have been shut in in 
Oklahoma and they are calling Force Majore on one of their Interruptable 
contracts to ENA (Sitara #495794).  I have been assured by OGE all firm gas 
transactions will continue to flow, only this one transaction will be 
effected.  The transaction calls for 15,000 mmbtu/day and is being cut down 
to 7,500/day through Saturday.

          Dear Ms. Marchand:

          On January 26, 2001 this office received an E-Mail memo from your
          office outlining a request to file monthly entries in conjunction
          with the importation of natural gas via the Maritimes and
          Northeast Pipeline from the Sable Island Project, Nova Scotia,
          Canada. I would like to clarify one point. The pipeline in
          question is located within the Area Port of Calais, Maine not
          Houlton, Maine as you indicated in your memo..

          Based on the information provided, Enron North America Corp. is
          authorized to import natural gas via the pipeline located in
          Baileyville, ME. Enron must file monthly entries by
          the 15th day of each month at either the Customs Office in
          Calais, ME. or Portland, ME. Customs will reconcile the monthly
          entry against the manifest quantities supplied by the carrier, in
          this case, Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline.

          If you have further concerns please do not hesitate to contact
          this office.

          Sincerely,

Brian:

I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:

 1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price 
alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial
      resolutions to avoid the reopener.

 2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is 
defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.

Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to 
finalize this with you.

Thanks, Jeff

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

Michael
apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?

Attached to the e-mail I am forwarding you will find the Enron Guaranty 
Agreement that was forwarded to Altrade.  Could you review the comments of 
Altrade and respond.  Also, I presume that Enron has provided a Guaranty to 
Altrade for ENA's business.  You may well wish to use that as a starting 
point.

Thanks,

Jeff

John,

I'm an analyst in the Generation Investments group, and we spoke regarding 
the Navy Yard transport curves about a month ago.

I am assuming there is probably no change in the applicable transport curves, 
but I just wanted to verify that there are no updates.

I have attached our past letters of correspondence regarding your suggestions 
for marking our transport expenses for the project.

Thanks,
Greg

Subject: Re: Brooklyn Navy Yard Project Transportation Curves Request  

Attached is a spreadsheet that details the transportation charges that you 
requested.  I recommend escalating the Iroquois and Transco charges in the 
same way as was done previously.  Escalate 18% of the Iroquois rates at the 
GDP inflator and 36% of the Transco rates.  This will take into account the 
pipeline's O&M cost increases.  TCPL is a different case.  Since we last 
looked at the Brooklyn Naval Yard assets, TransCanada has negotiated a 
settlement with its customers.  These are the rates that begin in 1/1/2002 on 
the spreadsheet.  However, TCPL is experiencing an inordinate amount of 
capacity turnback.  As their customer's contracts expire, the customers are 
not renewing.  This shoves their rate base on fewer and fewer customers and 
should increase their rates more quickly.  The next large customer turnback 
should occur in 2003.  For this reason, I recommend escalating TCPL's rates 
by 20% in 2003 and then escalating the entire rate by the GDP in the future.  
This should not only take into account the capacity turnback, but also 
consider the escalation in O&M costs.  Call me if you have any questions.

Hi, John,

Following up my phone call, I am sending a list of curve requests for you on 
the BNY project:

Base Year: 2001

1. Trans Canada:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  
2. Iroquois:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation 
 3. Transco Z1 - Z6:
  Demand Charges
 Variable Charges
 Fuel Requirement 
 Estimation of Trariff escalation  

On the Tariff escalation part, based on your inputs, we used 22%, 18%, and 
36% of GDP inflation for TransCanada, Iroquois and Transco, respectively.  
Also, you estimated % increase in Transco Tariff from 2001 to 2007.  

Thanks a lot for your help!

Subject: Sta. 20 Suction Pressures

Darrell,  Attached is a history (last 365 days) of the suction pressures of 
Station 20 arranged in descending order.  In a nutshell, we looked at the 
minimum pressure (492 psig), calculated the pressure drop (34# at 54.4 
MMcf/d) on the proposed 6.6 miles of 12" to get 458 psig at the upstream side 
of the regulator.  Typically we would like to have a 50# differental across 
the regulator, which would give us 408 psig downstream of regulation.  I 
believe you were needing 435 psig.

 

Looking at the it in reverse, 435 psig + 50 psig across reg =  485 psig, 
calculate pressure drop (31 psig), we would need 516 psig at the suction of 
Station 20.  Note there are only 8 days during the last year where the 
pressure was lower than 516 psig or 97.8% of the time.

Please call me if you would like to discuss further or would like to meet.

Two quick questions - first, where will the rehypothecation procedures with 
regard to Stoneville be documented (between Stoneville and Enron)?  Second, 
why did the "Interest Rate" definition in the Margin Agreement Amendment 
change from a Libor-based number to a Fed Funds-based number?  Thanks again 
and let me know.

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of the Master Electric 
Services and Sales Agm we've been talking about.  As discussed with Mike, I 
used a combination of the Master Form that Mike has been circulating to the 
business teams... and Mike's version of the Home Depot draft.  I've also 
incorporated certain provisions that Wal-Mart asked to include in the gas 
contract that Marianne Castano drafted.  You will see a number of provisions 
bracketed and bold.  Pls give me your thoughts on those and
Wal-Mart does not like arbitration and we deleted it in the gas contract.  
Have talked with Bob Williams our Enron Corp litig expert and says we need to 
hold firm on keeping arbitration if at all possible.   Have kept arbitration 
in the draft.
Mike S. and Jeff, Wal-Mart has the following standard provision it likes to 
include:  "Non-Interference:   In exercising EESI's rights herein, we shall 
not unreasonably interfere with your operations."   Normally we avoid such 
broad provisions but we agreed to include in the draft gas contract and draft 
metering agreement.  I did not add this to the draft.  Thoughts?
MIke S. and Jeff, any problems with keeping the Mutual Indemnity, Walmart 
asked for indemnity in gas contract and we agreed to include one.
Mike S. and Jeff, any problems with Severability provision?
 Mike H. and Angela, do you want the Add Delete and Substitution provisions 
that are in the draft (same as HD),
Walmart asked that we add a provision saying we'll use comm. reas. efforts to 
mitigate Penalties in the Operational Change provision, I will add this to 
the next draft.

Pls advise who at the Desk this draft should go to.

Below are the clean version, the blackline against Mike's HD draft and the 
blackline against the Master form that Mike circulated to the business team 
and lawyers 6-4.

Subject: Iroquois Gas Transmission's Eastchester Expansion

Iroquois has shuffled their customer base for the expansion into New York 
City beginning in November 2002.  The following customers have executed 
binding Precedent Agreements for 10 year contracts that would require a 
buy-out if the shipper tried to exit:

     Volume

Con Ed       30,000 Dthd
Keyspan Ravenswood     60,000
Mirant Corporation     60,000
Orion Power      60,000
Virginia Power Energy Marketing   20,000

Total     230,000 Dthd

Iroquois has changed their interconnect with Con Ed to the Throgs Neck 
section of the Bronx along the East River.  They are also starting to plan an 
expansion of the Eastchester project that will increase deliveries by 100,000 
to 200,000 Dthd beginning in the 2004-2005 time frame.  This expansion is 
timed similar to the recently announced plans by Duke/Keyspan and El Paso for 
projects into Long Island.  Iroquois is targeting NYPA, NRG and other 
announced merchant plants.

		 Subject: Response Needed - Small Business Admin. Evaluation of Enron's 
Subcontracting Program

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

Ruth:

In follow-up to our telephone  conversation,  I am confirming that it is my 
analysis of the purchase agreement between CES and ENA that ENA must refund 
to CES any transportation refunds it gets relating to the CES transportation 
contracts that relate to activity prior to January 1, 2000.  Likewise, if 
there are costs relating to such contracts prior to January 1, 2000, those 
are the responsibility of CES.

I hope this helps to clarify the situation.

Jeff

You are right.  Once this is assigned it cannot be used by ENA.  If everyone 
is fine with that, then there should be no issues.

If it is OK w/ Legal, then it is OK w/ me. The only question I have is that 
if we assign it to ENA Upstream, can they still do business w/ ENA..? (That's 
why we were doing a new one anyway...plus I don't think the old one had our 
riders)..., but again, if it is OK w/ you, it is OK w/me!

Jill,

Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with 
ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.  The GISB at issue was acquired from 
Columbia Energy Services.   In light of this there would be no need for a new 
GISB with Pioneer.  

To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.

Jeff,

I spoke with Bill B in credit this morning - currently, his main concern with 
Stoneville is the collateral issue.  We had assumed that Stoneville will have 
no credit line and all potential mark-to-market changes would be taken care 
of through rehypothecation (just like Chase).  However, we need to address 
the credit risk of Stoneville between when the margin call occurs and when 
the rehypothecation occurs.  He was also concerned where these 
rehypothecation procedures would be documented.  Let me know, but as I 
understand it, the Chase agreement should be a good format for this master 
agreement.  Thanks.

Michael

Please review the attached changes to the language that Eric developed.  A 
bit more detail has been added but the arguement is still general in nature.

A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up 
counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist 
on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of 
the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to 
forward this email on to your groups as well.

		 Subject: Counterparty Name Conventions


In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

Sandi,

I am told that you were the person responsible for drafting the confirmations 
for the Producer One finder's fee and that you will no longer be performing 
this function. I am trying to find out who in legal will be responsible for 
drafting these in the future.  As far as my records show, we have sent a 
confirmation to Alcorn, and we still need to prepare a confirmation for the 
Dale Resources deal.

Do you have the records that identify what deals that have been confirmed for 
Finder's fees?  Do you know who will be taking over this function?

I appreciate any help that you can provide.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Gary,

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic 
structure of the public folders needed for EWS Legal.  The initial access to 
create and/or rename folders should be given to the users identified next to 
the group and/or subgroup (i.e. for Enron Global Markets - grant access to 
Alan Aronowitz and Nita Garcia).   Upon completion of the migration, the 
assistant assigned to each of these groups will procure access to others in 
her group and create additional folders as they may be needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached 
information.

Thanks.

Janette Elbertson and Nony Flores

John,

LIG is the only pipe that delivers to the LUS generation station and 
therefore does not have a transportation rate.  If you wanted to transport to 
the TransLa/LIG interconnect, you would need to get a rate from LIG.  The 
contact at LIG is Bud Elkins at 832-397-3405.

Can you find out the published rate on LIG without calling them?

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily

not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This 
spreadsheet is current as of 12/04/00. I have also attached a 10/01/00 deal 
extract showing all deals in Sitara that still carried the CES prefix (which 
is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any

"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Jeff

I recently faxed you a power of attorney for execution on behalf of Enron 
North America Corp. - however the meeting is now to be on 11 Dec to take 
place after a change in Italian law (so resolutions can be approved by notary 
only and don't need to go to court).

As the dates have changed can you arrange for execution of this power of 
attorney instead - merely the dates have changed.
Sorry for the inconvenience - if you need an initialled copy please let me 
know.

Many thanks
Mike

Ed,

I had a chance to read the contract LUS and follow-up with a phone call to 
Ron Gary to clarify.  Please note the following information:

LUS entered into a letter agreement after the contract was put in place for 
gas supply greater than Base quantities.  That price is GDA Hub + $.04.  The 
letter agreement allows LIG to 
The contract has a 75% take requirement for Base quantities but has no 
penalty if LUS does not take.  LUS uses this optionality to buy less 
expensive power in the marketplace.  There has been times that LUS takes less 
than the Base quantity.  He would be open to a GDA keep whole for this but 
would like to have 24 months of history so he can compare.  Tricia is working 
on this.  
For the Natchiotoches plant, Seller has an out if TransLa interrupts.  LUS is 
given a credit of 45,000/year for fuel retention on TransLa.  We need to 
gross up our price to account for this.
There is a GDA keep whole for any vol's that are triggered.  The trigger 
price is NYMEX plus $.04 and this basis is fixed.
LUS has not nominated Surplus volumes in two years.
Our bid will be reduced by $30,000 for the year by LUS to compare us to LIG's 
bid for gas odorization.  This will not be a cost to Enron but will be used 
in their evaluation process.
We need to state how we will make deliveries firm or why our volumes will 
flow if we do not sign up for firm capacity form the pipeline.

There is additional stuff in the contract that we need to discuss.  I'm 
working on the proposal and Hodge is working on getting a discounted firm 
rate on Texas Gas and Columbia.  Ultimately, this is what will determine if 
we win this deal or not.  Lets discuss when you get a chance.

Thanks.

Unfortunately the unassigned contracts are all master contracts. 

As far as the sales transactions for delivery risk, looks like we only have 
25 (please note that 2 of these transactions are tied to GTCs due to the CES 
contract we inherited not being executed AND that these two deals are with 
Midcon Texas for whom I we already have some outstanding receivable issues 
with). I've attached a spreadsheet of the sales transactions (modified the 
outstanding transaction report eliminating the transactions where ENA is 
buyer) which should help Bryce to better determine our situation. The 
spreadsheet lists transaction numbers, counterparty name, ect. Please let me 
know if I can do anything else.

Cyndie.

Thanks so much for your quick response.  Are the other 215 'master' type 
contracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't get 
assigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concerned 
about those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you can 
help Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so he 
can quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.  Jeff, I 
assume that the 215 that do not have deals are really defunct, since all new 
deals would be done on ENA paper?

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This 
spreadsheet is current as of 12/04/00. I have also attached a 10/01/00 deal 
extract showing all deals in Sitara that still carried the CES prefix (which 
is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any 
further assistance.

ENA - Global Contracts




CES Transactions (Deal Extract) 10/1/00 - forward
(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been 
received that are flagged as evergreen in Sitara and as such represent a 
"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

01


The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=

choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

John,

I met with Ben regarding the Precedent Agreement this evening.  He had the 
following questions/comments:

1. "...Shipper's power plant construction by August 1, 2001, then either 
Party may terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing the other Party 
written notice of such termination.  ; provided that such right to terminate 
must be exercised on or before August 3, 2001.  In any event, unless the 
Shipper provides written notice to Transco on or before August 3, 2001 that 
it will enter into a Service Agreement , the Precedent Agreement will 
terminate automatically.

2. Can we make the Guaranty effective after August 3, 2001 if we do not 
terminate the Precedent Agreement?

3. In talking to Gerald Nemec, it also occurred to me that we need to 
determine any balance sheet effects of the Guaranty in relationship to this 
project.  I will check on this tomorrow and let you know.


Thanks.

Mark and Jeff,

The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a three 
year financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer would 
require hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enter 
into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at 
index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can 
we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and 
financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not 
be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have 
done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.  
I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset the 
potential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortable 
that the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through a 
contract.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Tanya

Jeff - attached are PG&E's comments to the Enron guarantee associated with 
the 10 day call transaction.  The revisions don't appear to be significant to 
me, but I obviously defer to your judgement.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

Roy, attached are the proposed guarantee formats as reviewed by our
attorney.  Please review and comment directly to Tanya Murphy, our attorney.
Although one of the guarantees states $1MM, I am still trying to get a firm
amount considering the fluctuations in prices and ensuring the March 31
termination date is OK.

We appreciate hearing from you very soon.

John
As discussed on Monday, Enron Canada has agreed to restructure its "Boston 
Gas" agreements with Encal Energy so that Encal will become the shipper of 
record for a portion of the TGP and Iroquois capacity.  They in turn  will 
release back  to ENA for one year each April.  There should be no disruption 
to the East Desk business other than they will have additional contracts to 
manage for the same net volume.

These are the precise releases we would like you to initiate.  What we need 
to know as soon as possible is what if any credit requirements from Encal 
that the pipelines will require.

Pipe Path   Type Assignor Assignee Start Date Expiry Date Volume  Comment

IGTS Waddington to Wright Perm ENA  Encal  Mar 1, 2001 Mar 31, 2007 7,600 
mmbtu from contract 125008
IGTS Waddington to Wright Temp Encal  ENA  Mar 1, 2001 Mar 31, 2002 7,600 
mmbtu to be renewed annually

Contract 125008 has a capacity of 35,465 mmbtu with a term of Mar 31/07.  
After this release there should be 27,865 mmbtu remaining.

TGP Wright to Boston CG Perm ENA  Encal  Mar 1, 2001 Mar 31, 2007 7,500 mmbtu 
from contract 29667
TGP Wright to Boston CG Temp Encal  ENA  Mar 1, 2001 Mar 31, 2002 7,500 mmbtu 
to be renewed annually

Contract 29667 has a capacity of 35,000 mmbtu with a term of Mar 31/07 and a 
fixed fuel ratio of 1.31%.  After this release there should be 27,500 mmbtu 
remaining.

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

Ooooo-k-aaaaaaay!  If nobody else steps up and asks for them, I'll keep the

Subject: Gulfstream Maps

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

Jeff Hodge will be out of the office beginning at noon tomorrow through next 
week.  If you have any issues that need to be discussed with him this week, 
please let me know, and I will coordinate an EES/EWS meeting with Jeff 
tomorrow morning.  While Jeff is out of town, he asks that we continue to 
copy him, but all question/issues should be directed to Carol St. Clair.  Jim 
Keller will be back next week and will be setting up meeting times with Carol 
as we have with Jeff.

As a follow up to yesterdays Staff meeting I would like to implement the 
following strategy on getting our "lists" in working order.

Each of the 5 working groups should appoint a lead for that group that will 
be ultimately responsible for the list activity.
Origination and mid-market should work together to prepare 1 combined list.
Producer origination and producer mid-market should work together to prepare 
1 combined list.
By next Monday (Feb 12) I would like to have the combined market list and 
combined producer list identifying target customers and ENA responsibility.  
By Monday (Feb 19) I would like to include Credit, EOL Registered, EOL 
participation level, and existing business.  Select someone in the group to 
work with credit and EOL on these issues.
The final list needs to be in the same format and available electronically.  
Kim Brown will assist in this effort.
Over time each group may expand their working list as needed.



I appreciate your attention to this matter


Frank

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

Michael

Michael
apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Good morning.  I received a call from the Chair's office requesting an 
electronic copy of our customer lists and coverage assignments.  Good thing 
that we have been working on that this week.  In addition they want to meet 
with Scott and me this week on Budget issues.  To that end, it is important 
that we are ready to address several things at today's staff meeting.

Completed, electronic customer lists and coverage assignments.  Because of 
the potential overlap with Fred's group, it is important that the "Producer" 
list be complete.  If the Producer does not show on our list it will, by 
default be covered by Fred's activity.
>From each group- Detailed write ups on a) Key market strategies b) Key 
Products c) Regulatory strategy.  How are you going to make your budget ?


See you are 3:00

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

We have been asked to provide an electricity contract form on a rush for 
Walmart.  Have talked with Mike Smith and we plan to use the Master Electric 
form that Mike is revising and plans to send to business team tonite.   The 
deal for Walmart is electricity only in CA right now, but will probably 
expand to other states later.   Angela Schwarz wants to have the form of 
contract agreed to and ready prior to having the transaction/price terms 
agreed to.  Jeff,   I plan to take Mike's latest version of the form tomorrow 
and revise that (including incorporating some of Walmart's comments on the 
gas deal that Marianne Castano was working on separately) and get it out for 
review by you, Mike and the business team, and will hope that we can get the 
draft form to Walmart in the next 2-3 days.   If y'all want to meet about 
Walmart we can, otherwise I'll plan to do this via phone and email.  Thanks,

I have been asked to work on a Walmart commodity deal covering several 
different states, not sure which ones yet.   Marianne Castano worked on a gas 
deal with them and otherwise we have no current business with them.   I plan 
to use the new Master Electric form that we have been working with ENA and 
the business team on.  Am coordinating with Mike Smith.  Jeff, when I have a 
draft ready I'll send it to you, probably toward the end of this week, I 
don't have pricing yet.  M3

Let's talk to John Hodge about that, They deal we did wih CP&L is strucured 
as follows:

April - October 01
Location:         Transco, Z5

volume:     up to 15,000 today
demand fee:    $0.09 per mmbtu  (demand fee charged on the entrie contract 
quantity regardless of quantity scheduled)
price:         Transco, NNY gas daily midpoint

I really do not have an idea of Transco zone 5 or Zone 6 demand and variable 
charges, but I know John Hodge will know.    Let's talk with him.    

Thank you!

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

Subject: Re: CES

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,
Tanya

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Applied Finance - January 25 & 26, 2001 in EB552     Cost:  $700.00

If a better understanding of Enron's transactions (a deal) that involves 
Enron's financial as well as commercial participation with another business 
entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you. 

This course will give you a firm grasp of basic finance but in the context of 
Enron's commercial and financial transactions.
The objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, 
to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the 
structure of a deal and provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that 
you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

To register for any of these classes, click here (), or call 713 853-0357.

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

Subject: Exchange with CGAS

John/Scott/Chris,
Please create a park and lend(synthetic storage) transport tkt in Sitara to 
capture the exchange we did with Cgas so we can schedule in Unify.  We park 
310,000 in March and get back in August of 2001.  John Hodge has associated 
costs. I believe the contracts are contract #'s 67300 and 67304.

The sitara tkts for the exchange are 655097 abnd 655096.  We will cover costs 
and be able to pay CGAS bills associated with this transaction once the 
transport cap. tkt is created in Sitara.  No need to create unnecessary CPR 
pipeline exchange tkts.
If you have questions let me know.

Tammi,

I called Southern Co and they are working on what a demand charge they would 
like to provide 10 day peaking service.  They mentioned that they looked at 
it last year and the price they were being offered was less than if they 
released the capacity as baseload for the entire year (which they did).  

John, can you find out what they did the release for?

So Co will be back at us next week.

Thanks for the update on status.   As Tom and I discussed we've made 
revisions to the draft anticipating a deal based on the new price structure 
and wanted to circulate this for internal review.  The blackline below shows 
the changes to the last draft that we sent to the customer.   If you have any 
comments, please let us know.  Assume we will revise the draft as necessary 
after your mtg.  Good luck!   M3

Wanted to update you on the timing and status.  We (Greg, Mark and I) will be 
meeting with the participants late next week to discuss our deal in person 
and answer questions.  Looks like we are still talking a wholesale index plus 
basis deal with a collar.

They may forward some comments about the contract in general in advance of 
our meeting.  If so, we will forward to you to discuss prior to the meeting.

I will be reviewing the 2001 Budget with Louise and Dave on Thursday.  Louise 
has already hit me up about deal flow.  I need by noon tomorrow all of the 
Not-so-hot-list deals populated.  The form includes a 'Value Estimate 2001" 
categorie.  Make sure that you complete this section.  If it is accrual, then 
put "accrual".  Under "Comments", first insert the date and then provide you 
comments.  BE very descriptive on "Description" and "comments".  Need very 
specific detail in these sections.  If you add a new deal, add a row at the 
bottom of your current list so that all of your activity is grouped 
together.  Within the "Originator Name" area put your name as well as you 
business unit, ( Producer Origination, Mid-market, etc. )

Thank you for your attention to this

Frank

Sorry that I have been tied up recently and I am e-mailing this to you
because I misplaced your phone number.  In any event, we are involved in
some contractual price reopener discussions with Duke under our supply
contract with Duke.  In connection with those discussions, Duke has made
certain information requests which we are obligated to respond to.  These
discussions will ultimately lead to an arbitration.  One of the requests
relates to our downstream sales of the gas which ultimately goes to FPL.
If you need more information or would like to discuss this further, please
contact me at 713-853-6911.  Thanks again for your help.

Jeff,  When I asked Tony Altmann to sign the letter, he asked for more
detail than I could remember about why we are agreeing to do this.  Could
you provide me with that information.  I think you probably had this
conversation with Joe Step, but he is out of town today.  Thanks for your

Good morning,

I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to update you regarding the
Homestead Expansion Precedent Agreements (PA's) status.  As I presented in my
letter to you last month, I expected to be in a position to distribute the 
PA's
this week.  However, that schedule was fairly aggressive and TCO Homestead
project team is currently in the process of completing some critical analysis
that we need to support our recommendations to TCO management.  TCO will
distribute the PA's as soon as TCO management has reviewed and approves the
recommendations made by the Homestead project team.  At this time, I am not
expecting any significant delay and remain hopeful that TCO will be able to
distribute the PA's during the week ending Friday, April 13.  (I am not
superstitious!)  I apologize for any inconvenience this unexpected delay may
cause you.  Please call your account manager or me if you have any questions 
or
special needs related to the Homestead PA's.  Thank you for your patience and
support of this project.  I look forward to working with you in the near
future.


Best Regards,

Michael Strauss

Ginny,  Please see the attached guaranty.  A clean and redlined version are 
attached.  I revised the language based on our discussions and added the 
language concerning interest which we had both previously approved.  We are 
OK to execute this form.  Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and 
execute.  Thanks.

Subject: Transco's Momentum Expansion and Elba

As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in 
Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of 
$0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in 
Zone 4.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the 
total rate is $0.415.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195.  If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205.  

Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 
85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia.  With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 
gas, the total rate is $0.35.  However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that 
takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39.
This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17.

Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 
3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at 
Elba.  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market.  One alternative 
is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba 
as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub + 
$0.10 at Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Through discussions with Phil Demoes, Southern Company has stated that a 
price of Hub + $0.20 was out of the question.  Phil indicates that we could 
probably strike a deal between their bid of Hub + $0.12 and Hub + $0.17.

Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the 
sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

 "ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into 
any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the 
HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas 
connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be 
construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such 
contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration 
and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction." 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of "stepping too close to or over the line".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need 
to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sincerely
 BNG

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

Brad/Alan -

Pursuant to our discussion last week, attached is a revised version of the 
Annex for Confirmation Central.  I have incorporated all of the comments we 
discussed and modified certain other provisions to more accurately reflect 
activity within the Module.

I have discussed the attached with Jeff Hodge and, at least initially, do not 
believe that any further information is needed for confirmation attachments 
for natural gas products.  Jeff will confirm this for me once he has 
completed his review of the agreement.  I also am awaiting Leslie's comments 
to the document.

I have a call out on the timing for retention of the information through the 
Module (Section 4(c)), however, since this is not intended to be a complete 
records retention period, the timing associated with the access in this area 
may be something more so driven by availability of space within 
CommodityLogic's database.

Please look over the attached when you have a chance and let me know if you 
should have any further comments or questions.

I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, but will have access to e-mail 
on both days.  I will also be getting voice messages during that time.

I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look 
at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS 
desk.

We  have not discussed EWS involvement in Term Sheets.  I would think 
contract review would be enough (do you really want mor things to review?),  
but will defer to your judgement.

Tom - Thanks for the update. Most definitely would like copies of everything! 

I understand that there have been internal meetings with GPG. What is the 
status of their involvement?

We can make an assessment of feasibility after we have had time to digest the 
information.  Any feedback from Bobby Rowan on the list of questions I sent  
a couple of months ago?

Subject: Power Alley

Folks:

I have the University of Georgia Study that explains the Power Alley 
concept.  For those of you who do not know what I am referring to, the 
Governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes, wants to develop an economic development 
zone right through the middle of the state.  In order to do this he intends 
to upgrade or build new infrastructure including roads, railroads, fiber 
optics, and a 24'' natural gas pipeline.  There are definite holes in the 
proposal, but I thought that you all might be interested.  If you are 
interested in receiving a copy, let me know.  If you know of others who 
should receive a copy, keep me posted.

The executive summary is only about 20 pages, and I could have copies in the 
mail today.  The rest of the study involves 200 pages, and if you would like 
a copy of that information, I could get it to you sometime after the first of 
the year.

I also would be interested in your comments about what needs to be done for 
this infrastructure to be of worth.  For example, it is clear to me that in 
order for the pipeline to be valuable, it needs to be tied into other pipes.  
It is not clear which pipes or where.  Second, it is clear that if they 
expect generation to be built, they will need upgraded transmission and 
possibly a bigger pipeline, 30'' (depending on demand).

Please give me some feedback.  I would like to provide some sort of 
constructive feedback to those presenting the information.  I have been 
working with some of the primary movers on this piece of work, and I would 
like to see the project completed.

Thanks.

Tom Chapman

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

Subject: Iroquois Gas Transmission's Eastchester Expansion

Iroquois has shuffled their customer base for the expansion into New York 
City beginning in November 2002.  The following customers have executed 
binding Precedent Agreements for 10 year contracts that would require a 
buy-out if the shipper tried to exit:

     Volume

Con Ed       30,000 Dthd
Keyspan Ravenswood     60,000
Mirant Corporation     60,000
Orion Power      60,000
Virginia Power Energy Marketing   20,000

Total     230,000 Dthd

Iroquois has changed their interconnect with Con Ed to the Throgs Neck 
section of the Bronx along the East River.  They are also starting to plan an 
expansion of the Eastchester project that will increase deliveries by 100,000 
to 200,000 Dthd beginning in the 2004-2005 time frame.  This expansion is 
timed similar to the recently announced plans by Duke/Keyspan and El Paso for 
projects into Long Island.  Iroquois is targeting NYPA, NRG and other 
announced merchant plants.

Talked with John Hodge further about the Transco Expansion from Zone 3 to 4 
(Mommentum).  Transco tossed out a rate of $.32 (100% load factor) plus 2.35% 
fuel plus $.026 commodity.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 
fuel), then the total rate is $.44.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Co.'s can pay Transco $.44 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub +$.22.  If you assume a basis of $.04 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $.26.  Note that a hard 
negotiation with Transco could net a better rate than $.44 and that this is 
only what they are proposing.

However, I do not think we will get anywhere close to that with Southern Co. 
given that they can site generation in Zone 2 (Alabama) vs. Zone 3 
(Georgia).  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will serving a peaking market.  Our alternative is 
to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as 
a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub +$.10 at 
Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Southern Co. has stated that a price of Hub +$.20 was out of the question.  
Probably between their bid of $.12 vs. Hub + $.20 is where we could strike a 
deal with them.

Subject: Southern Natural Contracts

Enron North America acquires firm transportation and storage capacity on 
Southern Natural through the supply/asset management relationship with 
Atlanta retail marketer, The New Power Company.  The New Power Company, an 
Enron affiliate, is assigned capacity by Atlanta Gas Light for New Power's 
use in serving Atlanta residential and commercial customers.  Enron North 
America does not hold any other long-term firm capacity on Southern Natural.  
However, Enron North America does have interruptible transportation and 
storage contracts on Southern Natural.  The IT contract allows Enron North 
America to receive gas from all active receipt points on Southern Natural's 
system and deliver gas to all active delivery points on Southern Natural's 
system.

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Please find attached a first draft of the following documents relating to the 
Canadian form of EEI master agreement:

1.  Clean copy of Canadianized EEI base contract
2.  Copy of the Candianized EEI base contract, blacklined to show the changes 
to the US form
3.  Canadianized schedules to the EEI contract, including only the three 
products previously included in the industrial power master
4.  Form of EEI Cover Sheet, including the porposed changes to the Canadian 
form of base contract that Enron Canada would include as part thereof

I will develop over the next while a set of situation specific riders that 
Enron Canada can use, similar to those riders developed by ENA.

Please provide me with any comments you may have with respect to these 
documents.  I understand that Chris has a fair amount of pressure on him to 
table our proposed form of the Canadianized EEI documents to the Ontario 
drafting group before their next meeting on November 22.

Cyndie.

Thanks so much for your quick response.  Are the other 215 'master' type 
contracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't get 
assigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concerned 
about those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you can 
help Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so he 
can quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.  Jeff, I 
assume that the 215 that do not have deals are really defunct, since all new 
deals would be done on ENA paper?

Currently we still have 289 active (meaning not terminated) unassigned CES 
contracts. As far as those with transactions, only 74 of the 289 have 
'active' deals. Currently, or as I understand the situation, Porter & Hedges 
(CES's legal counsel for CES Wholesale) is still driving the consent process 
for CES, we are not in the driver's seat.
 An additional note; many of the outstanding consents are with Appalachian 
producers who may never actually execute a consent based on the 
characteristics of the 'customer'.
As far as any future steps that Enron may chose to execute; I am prepared to 
help in anyway I can.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that 
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are 
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these 
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a 
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery 
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are 
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated 
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Thanks for your help,

The deals that we have in our system are not inclusive of gas daily daily 
deals or deals at index.  These deals are all in our physical sytems but are 
not at a fixed price,  therefore have no forward mark to market value.  These 
are the deals that are not evergreen deals.

I am somewhat unclear as to how we got from the 300 or so contracts that have 
not been assigned per Cyndie's list below to 3?  Does that mean all the other 
contracts have rolled off? Guadalupe Power Partners LP looks like one that 
has not rolled off that was a huge term sale with considerable delivery 
risk.  Are all of the deals on Cyndie's list index deals? Let's chat tomorrow.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a spreadsheet which tracks the CES non-assigned contracts. This 
spreadsheet is current as of 12/04/00. I have also attached a 10/01/00 deal 
extract showing all deals in Sitara that still carried the CES prefix (which 
is used to denote non-assigned deals), this report was originally pulled from 
Sitara for Tanya Rohauer. Please call me at 713.853.1443 if I can be of any 
further assistance.

(Please note, there are several transactions for which consent has not been 
received that are flagged as evergreen in Sitara and as such represent a 
"rolling" CES transaction and as such exposure until consent for assignment 
is received or until the transaction/contract is terminated. I have 
highlighted these transaction in green.)

Jeff,

Genia is having problems with her laptop, and evidently it was never imaged 
properly.  Our floor tech, Kien is going to reimage the machine, but we also 
need to order an additional 128 megs of memory.  

If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette.  

Thanks!

(Janette, Genia is under GL #0413, CC #105657.)

Subject: Transco's Momentum Expansion and Elba

As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in 
Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of 
$0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in 
Zone 4.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the 
total rate is $0.415.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195.  If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205.  

Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 
85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia.  With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 
gas, the total rate is $0.35.  However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that 
takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39.
This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17.

Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 
3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at 
Elba.  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market.  One alternative 
is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba 
as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub + 
$0.10 at Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Through discussions with Phil Demoes, Southern Company has stated that a 
price of Hub + $0.20 was out of the question.  Phil indicates that we could 
probably strike a deal between their bid of Hub + $0.12 and Hub + $0.17.
