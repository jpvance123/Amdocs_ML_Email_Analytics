Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation ("AHC") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC ("HESCO") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC ("HETCO") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above are on my desk in a file marked "Hess".

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Be sure to talk to Peter on any of the Canada related master nettings so he
can orchestrate any necessary Canada filings.  I have spoken with him on
this matter so he should be up to speed.  Any questions, stop by.

   We will need the "organizational ID" number for the Delaware, Maryland
   and
   Texas entities.  If you wish, we can obtain this information from CT
   Corp.
   or a similar service provider for a charge of $12 per entity.

   Also, for UCC filing purposes, we need to know whether any counterparty
   is
   a "transmitting utility", i.e., entity primarily engaged in transmitting
   or
   producing electricity or transmitting goods by pipeline.

   Finally, I assume you will consult with local counsel regarding the
   Canadian counterparties.

   Thank you.

As we discussed last week, attached is netting agreement for Electric Power.
In my opinion the agreement is standard in nature and as you should  agree,
in my opinion of course.  Please review and comment if you would like to
modify.  

As you know,  I will  be question frequently regarding the status of this
agreement,  therefore anything I can do to help complete this agreement in a
timely manner will be appreciated.

You should probably ask them about their status as a transmitting utility.
They should provide a related representation in the agreement.

Insofar as we are working on numerous filings, I wonder if it would be
efficient to "centralize" the process of obtaining the organizational ID
numbers with my paralegal, who, as previously noted, can get the numbers
from CT Corp.  As you know, this will cost $12 per entity, but might well
save money by streamlining the process.  Please advise.

Thank you.

Lech:

   Attached please find the Collateral Annex to the Reliant Master Netting
   Agreement -- didn't realize you needed to see it as well.  By this
   e-mail, I am requesting that Marie coordinate with you to get you
   Reliant's organizational ID number.  How do I go about confirming that
   Reliant Energy Services, Inc. is not a transmitting utiltity?

   Local counsel will handle the Canadian entity.

   Subject:  Re: FW:


   As a threshold  matter, I note that the basic purpose of the UCC filings
   is
   to "belt and suspender" the cross-party netting provisions of the MNA by
   having the counterparty(ies) grant  a security interest in the
   counterparty's receivables from Enron.  This is typically accomplished
   through the grant  of a security interest in "Obligations" under the
   MNA.

   In this case, however, I do not find in the Collateral provisions
   (Section
   6) the Obligations included.  Is this collateral covered in a related
   Collateral Annex?  Alternatively, is this omission an oversight , or a
   deliberate choice by the parties?  If we do intend to have a security
   interest in the counterparty's receivables, and these are not picked up
   in
   the CA, the MNA should be revised accordingly.

   Also, if we are going to file against the receivables, we will need to
   know
   the "organizational ID" number of Reliant Energy Services Inc., and its
   address.  Regarding the Canadian entity, I assume you will consult with
   local counsel.

   Finally, we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that the
   Delaware entity is not a "transmitting utility", i.e., an entity
   primarily
   engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the
   transmission of goods by pipeline.

   Thank you.

Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc. ("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas, physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.

This is my stab at the very complicated Duke relationship.  Please call with questions.  Janna Blanter at Duke should validate this list as well.  Call with questions.  The guaranties are a disaster because some of these are gtd by Duke Capital, others stand on their own or currently have an intermediate guarantor.  We should think about one all encompassing gty from Enron Corp and Duke Capital to simplify things.

While I would not recommend amending any executed MNA's for this purpose,
it probably makes sense to include such a representation  going forward.
It could be a simple as: "Counterparty [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial
Code."

Do you mean that we should include a rep re the fact that they're not a
transmitting utility in the Master Netting Agreement?  The MNA has already
been executed, and there is no such rep in the agreement.  Is this a rep
that should be included in our form of MNA?  If so, I'll need to let Mary
Cook know that the form needs to be revised.

As per Mary Cook's e-mail of last week, I believe that Marie Heard and/or
Tana Jones will centralize the process of obtaining the organizational ID
numbers.  Marie, please confirm with Lech.

   Lech:

      Attached please find the Collateral Annex to the Reliant Master
   Netting
      Agreement -- didn't realize you needed to see it as well.  By this
      e-mail, I am requesting that Marie coordinate with you to get you
      Reliant's organizational ID number.  How do I go about confirming
   that
      Reliant Energy Services, Inc. is not a transmitting utiltity?

      Local counsel will handle the Canadian entity.

      Regards,

      Leslie Hansen

      Subject:  Re: FW:


      As a threshold  matter, I note that the basic purpose of the UCC
   filings
      is
      to "belt and suspender" the cross-party netting provisions of the MNA
   by
      having the counterparty(ies) grant  a security interest in the
      counterparty's receivables from Enron.  This is typically
   accomplished
      through the grant  of a security interest in "Obligations" under the
      MNA.

      In this case, however, I do not find in the Collateral provisions
      (Section
      6) the Obligations included.  Is this collateral covered in a related
      Collateral Annex?  Alternatively, is this omission an oversight , or
   a
      deliberate choice by the parties?  If we do intend to have a security
      interest in the counterparty's receivables, and these are not picked
   up
      in
      the CA, the MNA should be revised accordingly.

      Also, if we are going to file against the receivables, we will need
   to
      know
      the "organizational ID" number of Reliant Energy Services Inc., and
   its
      address.  Regarding the Canadian entity, I assume you will consult
   with
      local counsel.

      Finally, we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that
   the
      Delaware entity is not a "transmitting utility", i.e., an entity
      primarily
      engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the
      transmission of goods by pipeline.

      Thank you.

Hi Marie -- I had come around to touch base with you on this but had missed you.  When this revised template is available, will you be able to help by installing the references to the various master contracts between Enron afilarttes and AEP which would be referenced?  Ed Sacks is our credit contact.  I will touch base with you on this -- I am hoping to get copies of those underlying masters also (I already have the wholesale power masters, and can provide you a copy of each, if you need them). Thanks. --David

Marie,

You may already have this in your list, but just in case, Crown Central is another counterparty that submitted their form of netting agreement for execution.  Nidia Mendoza has already provided Jay Williams with copy of it.  Please add to the list of negotiations and assign it to John Viverito as well.

Thanks.
Nony

Nony-

Please also double check with Marie regarding Crown Central, which has also requested a netting agreement, but has not yet made the list.  

The coordinator from credit who needs to be notified regarding all netting agreements is Jason (Jay) Williams.  I believe that Nidia Mendoza is already in contact with him, but we should follow up.

Thanks,

John

BP wants to add Atlantic Richfield Company to the netting agreement.
Apparently, Atlantic Richfield Company owns the Calciner unit at the Carson
Refinery in California and sells 30 MW of power to Enron Power Marketing.

Please let me know your response.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Kate and Teresa:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various Enron entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

Enron Gas Processing Company
Enron Gas Marketing Canada
Enron Oil Canada Ltd.
Enron Oil Corporation

Are these prior names of current Enron entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!

Marie - I have been involved in seeing that the proper security notices are being registered in respect of the PG&E master netting agreement as it involves Enron Canada.  Just today I became aware that the master netting agreement with Reliant involves Enron Canada as well.  Greg Johnston and I will see that the proper Canadian registrations are made for the Reliant agreement.

Please let me know if there are any other agreement that involve Canadian Enron entities (BP Amoco I believe may).

Regards
Chris

Ed will be calling to you on this.  Given Enron's situation, we are only focusing on Master Netting Agreements that our counterparties are requiring from us in order to trade with us.  I thought that this was one, but according to Ed, it is not.

Andrew:
Who are the "commercial guys"?  Also, our position generally is that we do not include EES contracts in Master Netting Agreements.  		


Ed and Tanya:
How do you want to handle this?

Andrew wanted you to know that his commercial guys want to respond to Constellation's comments on the Master Netting Agreement -- TODAY.

Andy - very few changes to the Master Netting Agreement - I don't have
Carol's email address, can you forward this to her??  I am reviewing
Collateral Annex next and I will call her in the am to discuss further.  I
have highlighted the Security Interest section to discuss further.  My
commercial folks are currently reviewing a revised 2.3 which I should have
to you by 11 am tomorrow if all goes well.

We may need organizational identification numbers (which is not the tax ID)
for some entities, depending on the state.  Otherwise, we should have all
the info we need for BP Amoco.

I am about to send a process memo of my own to the attorneys in your shop
that will address the organizational ID number and related points

Thank you.

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to "kill" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1).

Although formally only two AEP entities are party to the MNA, AEPSC is
acting as agent for a number of affiliates.  This raises, to my mind at
least, the possibility that those subsidiaries would be considered the real
"debtors" for UCC purposes.

Accordingly, I believe the prudent course is to file against each named
subsidiary, as well as against  AEPSC and AEPSI.  To do so, we will need
the subsidiaries' respective addresses, jurisdictions of organization and
"organizational ID" number (if organized in Colorado, Delaware, Maryland or
Texas), and confirmation that each is, as certainly appears to be the case,
a "transmitting utility" under the UCC, i.e., an entity primarily engaged
in the production or transmission of electricity or the transmission of
goods through a pipeline.

Thank you.

1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

No change from Friday update --final format of MN&SA put forward to AEP for comment Friday afternoon and no comments have yet been sent back.  Elizabeth Sager indicated we were trying to complete a number of wholesale power 'ring fence' trades with AEP & third parties before completing the MN&SA and related wholesale power enabling agreement amendments.  Elizabeth may be able to provide more detailed info.  --David

Carol, do I need to be doing anything from ECC's perspective on any of this?  Peter asked me to deal with this stuff while he is out of the office for a few days, but I understand I am simply, when required, confirming underlying agreements regarding ECC and providing copies of such agreements where requested.

Thanks
Greg

As a threshold matter, I note that the basic purpose of the UCC filings is
to "belt and suspender" the cross-party netting provisions of the MNA by
having the counterparty(ies) grant to each Enron party a security interest
in the counterparty's receivables from Enron.  This is typically
accomplished through the grant of a security interest in "Obligations"
under the MNA.

In this case, however, I do not find in the Collateral provisions (Section
6) the Obligations included.  Is this collateral covered in a related
Collateral Annex?  Alternatively, is the omission an oversight, or a
deliberate choice by the parties?  If we do intend to have a security
interest in the counterparty's receivables, and it is not picked up in the
CA, the MNA should be revised accordingly.

Also, if we are going to file against the receivables, we will need to know
in which jurisdiction FPL is organized and, further, if it is organized in
Colorado, Delaware, Maryland or Texas, its "organizational ID" number.

Finally, we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that the
counterparty is not a "transmitting utility", i.e., an entity primarily
engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the
transmission of goods by pipeline.  It would not appear to be such a
utility, based on its name.

Thank you.

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

Can someone in your shop get us copies of the guaranties?  I pulled the one in our ISDA file and the amounts don't match, so I don't know if there have been any amendments or not.

If you can't find someone to pull these, let me know and I'll come down and get them.

Also, Livelink doesn't show a power master with Coral Power LLC, but I have someone checking on this.

Bill,

It is my understanding that you are handling netting agreements for Enron.
Thus, please find the attached agreements for each entity we represent and
review them.  As soon as you have had the opportunity to look them over,
contact me and we will work together to execute them.  I know that having
such agreements in place is a priority for both organizations.  Also, if
there is another contact person that I should be in touch with, please let
me know that, as well.  If you have any further questions, feel free to
contact me.

Thanks so much!!

Casi

Mary,

I have attached a revised agreement ("Acknowledgement") and schedule that should be used with respect to those master credit netting agreements that involve both Enron Canada Corp.and ENA.  Rather than doing a separate Acknowledgement for each different credit netting agreement, I think we should be o.k. entering into one global agreement between ENA and ECC and merely updating the attached schedule (Marie is keeping me updated as we add additional counterparties).  We should try to execute the Acknowledgement simultaneous to the execution of the master credit netting agreements (since these are merely executed internally, this should not pose a problem).

Once you have had a chance to review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments. 

Marie -- can you please take a look at the schedule (the second attachment) and let me know the dates that the underlying masters were executed.  Thanks.

MRC

Attached is a redline of the Master Netting Agreement.  We are narrowing it
to limit it to being a set off agreement.  In this way we can avoid having
to go through the threshold issues and collateral management issues, which
in light of the fact we don't have a Collateral Annex are not
insignificant.  Please review it and call me with you comments.  We are
continuing our review and may have additional changes.  In addition, we are
complying a list of the AEP companies which will need to be included.(See

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

Do you mean that we should include a rep re the fact that they're not a transmitting utility in the Master Netting Agreement?  The MNA has already been executed, and there is no such rep in the agreement.  Is this a rep that should be included in our form of MNA?  If so, I'll need to let Mary Cook know that the form needs to be revised.

As per Mary Cook's e-mail of last week, I believe that Marie Heard and/or Tana Jones will centralize the process of obtaining the organizational ID numbers.  Marie, please confirm with Lech.

You should probably ask them about their status as a transmitting utility.
They should provide a related representation in the agreement.

Insofar as we are working on numerous filings, I wonder if it would be
efficient to "centralize" the process of obtaining the organizational ID
numbers with my paralegal, who, as previously noted, can get the numbers
from CT Corp.  As you know, this will cost $12 per entity, but might well
save money by streamlining the process.  Please advise.

   Subject:  Re: FW:


   As a threshold  matter, I note that the basic purpose of the UCC filings
   is
   to "belt and suspender" the cross-party netting provisions of the MNA by
   having the counterparty(ies) grant  a security interest in the
   counterparty's receivables from Enron.  This is typically accomplished
   through the grant  of a security interest in "Obligations" under the
   MNA.

   In this case, however, I do not find in the Collateral provisions
   (Section
   6) the Obligations included.  Is this collateral covered in a related
   Collateral Annex?  Alternatively, is this omission an oversight , or a
   deliberate choice by the parties?  If we do intend to have a security
   interest in the counterparty's receivables, and these are not picked up
   in
   the CA, the MNA should be revised accordingly.

   Also, if we are going to file against the receivables, we will need to
   know
   the "organizational ID" number of Reliant Energy Services Inc., and its
   address.  Regarding the Canadian entity, I assume you will consult with
   local counsel.

   Finally, we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that the
   Delaware entity is not a "transmitting utility", i.e., an entity
   primarily
   engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the
   transmission of goods by pipeline.

   Thank you.

What is the substance of the financing statement filings being done in connection with the Master Netting Agreements? I assume it is to describe the granting of security interest clause in the Master Netting Agreement. Am I correct?

Marie - I have been involved in seeing that the proper security notices are being registered in respect of the PG&E master netting agreement as it involves Enron Canada.  Just today I became aware that the master netting agreement with Reliant involves Enron Canada as well.  Greg Johnston and I will see that the proper Canadian registrations are made for the Reliant agreement.

Please let me know if there are any other agreement that involve Canadian Enron entities (BP Amoco I believe may).

Regards
Chris

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Thanks for the reminder.  Marie, as it stands now,  am I correct to believe that I am waiting for the following:

1.	Intructions from Carol on who and when to call Credit regarding making contact with Florida Power & Light to forward and discuss a Master Netting Agreement;
2.	Reciept of a New Master Netting Agreement form that addresses the following:
	a.	Automatic dragnet clause as to non-specifically mentioned commodity contracts and future agreements
	b.	Tax language that addresses 10% withholding tax that would otherwise be payable upon netting under the Master Netting Agreement
	c.	Certain other changes Mary thinks are necessary in light of current facts.

In the meantime, could you please forward me a copy of the Issues List as I did not receive one earlier.

Thanks,

Steve

We will need the "organizational ID" number for the Delaware, Maryland and
Texas entities.  If you wish, we can obtain this information from CT Corp.
or a similar service provider for a charge of $12 per entity.

Also, for UCC filing purposes, we need to know whether any counterparty is
a "transmitting utility", i.e., entity primarily engaged in transmitting or
producing electricity or transmitting goods by pipeline.

Finally, I assume you will consult with local counsel regarding the
Canadian counterparties.

Thank you.

I am sure the captioned parties have not been included in any master netting agreements to date and should not be included due to marketing affiliate rules; however, given the financings of the pipes, just a reminder TO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN ANY MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT.

Marie,

As per your request, attached are Conoco's GTCs as well as ERAC's standard exceptions to such GTCs.  Everyone in the crude (domestic) industry trades under Conoco's GTCs.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks.

Marie,

Please forward to Cindy and ask her to call me to discuss.  Would you please cc me with it so that I'm sure I've got the latest draft?  Thanks for your help.

Steve

P.S.  Am I supposed to call Credit for the terms of the Collateral Annex, or does that come later?

I have been assigned FPL Energy Trading.  I drafted a MNA and sent it ot Jay Williams on Wednesday, October 31, 2001.  I have called several time for an FPL Energy contact and have been told that no further action will be necessary until a Netting Agreement (not an MNA) is finalized with FPL Energy's utility affiliate: Florida Power and Light. Jeff Hodge is working with Jay on that matter; thus, I am at this time awaiting instructions from Jay Williams.

Marie:

I received your e-mail re the revisions to the Master Netting Agreement.  I will not be in the office later this afternoon and want to make sure that Dede Russo at Reliant receives a first draft today.  Thus, when you distribute the revised draft to the working group, will you also e-mail a copy of the draft with the Collateral Annex to Dede at "drusso@reliantenergy.com".  Note on the e-mail that you are sending the draft pursuant to my request and let her know that I am working to customize with credit terms, etc. for Reliant.  

Jay Williams in credit is going to work with me on the Reliant Master Netting Agreement.  I have asked Jay to send to you a list of all the Reliant entities and a list of trading contracts as soon as possible.  Please have these contracts compiled for me.  Feel free to contact Martha Keesler, my assistant, to the extent she can assist you or your designee in pulling contracts off of LiveLink.  I will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I would love to have copies of all the Reliant documents for Thursday morning.

Thanks so much,

Leslie

Har,

As requested, I have attached the agreements in redline and in final.  I am
turning my attention to the Guaranty Agreements.

Not to beat a dead horse, and as John also mentioned, we will not accept
changes to this Master Agreement that alter the terms and conditions of the
Underlying Master Agreements.  At a later date, we will be happy to
negotiate in good faith concerning whether it would be mutually agreeable
to amend those Underlying Master Agreements.  This Master Setoff Agreement
is simply not the vehicle in which to accomplish that goal.

Regarding any concerns that this Master Agreement may not be enforceable in
Europe (or because it covers various Underlying Master Agreements for deals
in Europe), please note that Section 13 provides severability language that
should operate to carve out the European agreements that might otherwise
create enforceability problems.  Therefore, our approach has been to
include them since your colleagues have acknowledged that they do not know
whether there would be enforceability problems in Europe.

I look forward to discussing this final document with you at your earliest
convenience.  I will be seeking signatures from Pryor at 3:30.

Thanks.

Ernie

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Yes.  Carol just left a voice mail that Jay Williams (x53923) will be our credit contact.

I am just gathering the last documents for FPL and Florida Power & Light and will be bringing them around to you shortly.

Here is the issues list.

Thanks for the reminder.  Marie, as it stands now,  am I correct to believe that I am waiting for the following:

1.	Intructions from Carol on who and when to call Credit regarding making contact with Florida Power & Light to forward and discuss a Master Netting Agreement;
2.	Reciept of a New Master Netting Agreement form that addresses the following:
	a.	Automatic dragnet clause as to non-specifically mentioned commodity contracts and future agreements
	b.	Tax language that addresses 10% withholding tax that would otherwise be payable upon netting under the Master Netting Agreement
	c.	Certain other changes Mary thinks are necessary in light of current facts.

In the meantime, could you please forward me a copy of the Issues List as I did not receive one earlier.

Thanks,

Steve

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

Importance:	High


1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a "transmitting
utility" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

Because of the, somewhat Byzantine, transition rules under the new UCC, if

BP wants to add Atlantic Richfield Company to the netting agreement.
Apparently, Atlantic Richfield Company owns the Calciner unit at the Carson
Refinery in California and sells 30 MW of power to Enron Power Marketing.

Please let me know your response.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

The update on Goldman Sachs/J Aron Master Netting Agreement is that the legal form of the document has been agreed to with their inside counsel. We are waiting for Credit (Houston)'s approval before circulating for signature. I spoke with Tanya R. today. She said she would speak to Bill about GS' request to sign the cross-affiliate netting agreement w/o collateral. With Bill's approval, we can circulate for signature.

We are organizing the data regarding debtor names, jurisdictions of
incorporation, etc., for the various Master Netting Agreements that we have
received over the past few days.

I note that some, but not all, jurisdictions require inclusion of the
debtor's "organizational identification number" on the UCC filing.  We
should be able to obtain this number, where necessary, in most cases
through an on-line search.  If not, we can either ask you to track it down
(or give us a contact person in this regard) or, for a cost of $12 per
debtor, obtain the information from a search firm.

In any event, we will be back to you in a day or two with an update and,
perhaps, requests for additional information.  Once we have all requisite
information, the filings can be made in another day or two.  In the
meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Leslie -

There was a correction to the Reliant collateral annex that we made on Thursday afternoon after you had already left.  The "Rounding Amount" and "Minimum Transfer Amount" were both shown as $25,000 but should have been $250,000.

I made the correction to the electronic version and we have sent the revised hard copies to Reliant.  Please call me with any questions.

Lech, DO NOT FILE ON DYNEGY.  DISREGARD PRIOR EMAIL.  The Dynegy master netting does not include the security interest grant.  They deleted it.  I had forgot.  It was a take it or leave it and we had to sign it this way.  Therefore, for now go ahead with the searches, but do not make a filing at this time.  We hope to renegotiate and clean it up this week. 

Harlan, please stop by.

Is Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. now Enron North America Corp.?

Do you know where BP Gas, Inc. or BP Capital Fund LP are incorporated?  I
ask because we cannot find bp companies with those names here in North

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Harlan,

With respect to the Calpine agreement, please remove the following entities as we neither have outstanding transactions nor do we anticipate having any:  Sheridan Energy, Inc., DEI Texas, Inc., CPN Gas Marketing Company, Calpine Power Services Company.  A further note on Calpine Power Services Company, effective11/1/00, it was merged into Calpine Energy Services, LP. With Calpine, the Enron entities that should be covered are EPMI and ENA.

Dynegy UK should probably come off since we are only netting US and Canada exposures.  Add Dynegy Coal Trading & Transportation, L.L.C. if we want coal covered.   Enron entities should include EGLI, ECC, ERAC, EPMI, ENA, ENA Upstream Co. LLC; EES; Enron Coal Services Ltd.

Subject:	Master Netting Agreement Assignments...Identification of legal entities comprising your assigned "houses"

Based on the latest Master Netting Agreement Assignment List, you are assigned to one or more "houses" to prepare a Master Netting Agreement.  I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This "excisement" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-Enron legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete "house" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

Best Regards,
BNG

Marie:

Can you please check on the status of the confirmations for the Reliant/Bank of Montreal Ring Trades.  Please confirm that the confirmations have been reissued and ask to be informed immediately when we receive executed copies back from the counterparties.  This is a big transaction and we need to make sure that we get the confirms signed, sealed and delivered as soon as possible!

Thanks for your help with this.

Leslie

Attached please find the Collateral Annex to the Reliant Master Netting Agreement -- didn't realize you needed to see it as well.  By this e-mail, I am requesting that Marie coordinate with you to get you Reliant's organizational ID number.  How do I go about confirming that Reliant Energy Services, Inc. is not a transmitting utiltity?

Local counsel will handle the Canadian entity.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

As a threshold  matter, I note that the basic purpose of the UCC filings is
to "belt and suspender" the cross-party netting provisions of the MNA by
having the counterparty(ies) grant  a security interest in the
counterparty's receivables from Enron.  This is typically accomplished
through the grant  of a security interest in "Obligations" under the MNA.

In this case, however, I do not find in the Collateral provisions (Section
6) the Obligations included.  Is this collateral covered in a related
Collateral Annex?  Alternatively, is this omission an oversight , or a
deliberate choice by the parties?  If we do intend to have a security
interest in the counterparty's receivables, and these are not picked up in
the CA, the MNA should be revised accordingly.

Also, if we are going to file against the receivables, we will need to know
the "organizational ID" number of Reliant Energy Services Inc., and its
address.  Regarding the Canadian entity, I assume you will consult with
local counsel.

Finally, we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that the
Delaware entity is not a "transmitting utility", i.e., an entity primarily
engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the
transmission of goods by pipeline.

Thank you.

Marie, we do not have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  We do, however, have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd. dated September 19, 1999.  Attached is a copy of the agreement (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 

With respect to Engage Energy Canada L.P., attached is the Amended and Restated Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement dated January 4, 2001 (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 

I will have to fax the Firm Gas Sales Contract (15-year Sithe Supply) Agreement (plus the Amendment) to you, as I can't seem to locate it on the system.  Stephanie Panus should have a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement with Engage.  Are you able to get it from her or would you just like me to fax our copy to you?  ISDAs are not on our system as they are generated in Houston.

With respect to Coral Energy Canada, Inc., I will be faxing to you the following documents:

	- Letter from Shell Canada Limited dated June 1, 1997 assigning certain agreements to Coral (see Schedule "A" attached to letter)
	- Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement to you (again, I can't seem to locate it on the system) dated January 3, 1995
	- Firm Gas P/S Agreement (for transactions of 31 days or fewer) dated June 30, 1993(plus letter amending agreement dated June 13, 1994)
	- Interruptible Gas P/S Agreement dated October 21, 1993


If you need anything else after you've reviewed these documents, please let me know.

Sharon

   Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see
   attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced
   AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to
   masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading
   affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the
   AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc.
   ("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling
   agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas,
   physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit
   group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical
   synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please
   contact me with any questions. -- David

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

Transactions to be included:

ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA
ECL/BNPP ISDA
ECTD/BNPP physical UK gas business

Bill does not want to include any of the brokerage agreeements.  Also, I beleive we have kept Metals out of everyhting thus far and should continue to do so.  One point of note in the document is section 2 BNPP appears to have modified the language such that the Non Defaulting party can cherry pick which agreements it wants to terminate - this is unacceptable. To be honest, I am going to need your help walking me through this document as they have changed so much I am unclear in many instances  what their changes accomplish.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya

draft with you tomorrow morning with a view to its  execution by tomorrow
afternoon.  Seth may be reached at 212 572-5317, and  I may be reached at

According to our database the Atlantic Richfield and BP are not related, but after searching for BP subsidiaries I was able to uncover that the two are related. I also believe that Atlatic Richflied purchases petroleum-related products as well so please add that to the list of products.
I left a copy the spreadsheet with the added information on the desk you were using but I will attach a copy to this e-mail. The guarantor is listed next to the counterparty. Please let me know how I can help.

BP wants to add Atlantic Richfield Company to the netting agreement.
Apparently, Atlantic Richfield Company owns the Calciner unit at the Carson
Refinery in California and sells 30 MW of power to Enron Power Marketing.

Please let me know your response.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Because of the, somewhat Byzantine, transition rules under the new UCC, if
the location of the chief executive office of any party against which we
are searching was different on July 1, 2001 than it is today, I would
appreciate it if you would let me know.  Thank you.

Subject:	Revised Master Agreement

Har,

At long last, attached please find the revised agreement, in redline and in
final.  My instructions were to prepare execution copies, have them signed
on behalf of the various Dynegy entities, and they are being hand delivered
to Mr. Bradford in your credit group for execution on behalf of the various
Enron entities.  I also prepared guaranty agreements from Dynegy Holdings
and from Enron Corp., each of which has been either executed or
acknowledged on behalf of Dynegy.  The decision upstairs was that this
final version was "take it or leave it" for Enron.

A summary of the major changes:

1.   All margining language and references to Collateral were removed.
2.   All operating Underlying Master Agreements were included.
3.   The "Group" payment concept was eliminated in Section 4 because it was
not clear who would actually be making the payment.

Thanks.

Ernie

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

Andy - in between watching this amazing Game 7 of the Series, have finished
off my review of the Collateral Annex.  Carol deserves all the credit in the
world - great job on this document.  My comments are minimal and a lot of
them rest with decisions that need to be made by the credit department.
Look forward to talking to you in the am.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

I've asked Marie Heard, one of our legal assistants, to send you a draft
of the Master Netting Agreement as soon as it is ready -- most likely
today.  I will have to customize for Reliant, but at least you can start
looking at the agreement.

As you are aware a "safety net" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.

Any questions, call me.

I do not have them yet.  Marie, will you have these entities (as noted in the PGE master netting agreement) researched by Mary H.

Have you been able to determine the location of the chief executive office
of the PG&E entities for purposes of UCC searches?  Also, with reference to
the list that Marie Heard furnished, I take it that we should file and
search against each entity.  If so, we will, of course, need the exact
legal name, jurisdiction of organization, and location of chief executive
office of each.

Thank you.

I have asked Jay last week and today to find out who has the credit contact at El Paso so we can put pressure on them to look at the draft document.  I have forwarded to Jay my spreadsheet outlining the various contracts and GTC's that may be included in the Master Netting Agreement at his request.  In the meantime I am working on a second draft to more accurately describe the contracts and include the recent updates to the documents.  We will need to amend many of the contracts and GTC's as well to specifically modify the "one way", "automatic early termination" and "cherrypicking" provisions.

Andy - in  between watching this amazing Game 7 of the Series, have  finished
off my review of the Collateral Annex.  Carol  deserves all the credit in the
world - great job on this  document.  My comments are minimal and a lot of
them rest  with decisions that need to be made by the credit  department.
Look forward to talking to you in the  am.

Marie,

My system is showing that Sid Richardson Carbon & Gasoline Co. Inc., Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd's parent also trades with Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. physical natural gas liquids through an evergreen contract.   Young, Marshall R Oil Co., a sister company of Richardson shows no transactions, no exposure on my credit system.

There is an Enron company  LOA, Inc. that shows physical natural gas exposure with Richardson.  I called Bill Hayes at Richardson, and he will put together a list of their entities and products their currently trading with Enron for comparison purposes.  I'll let you know as soon as I get more information.

EES entered into a GISB with BP Energy Company.  I cannot locate the file.  Christy Finelli is in charge of the GISB World and is out today.  By copy of this e:mail I am requesting Christy to provide a copy of the agreement for you.

With respect to Castrol Industrial North America, Inc. Legal does not have any contracts with this counterparty nor does the Confirmation desk have any documentation  that supports EESI doing business with this company.

If there is other info about this customer you may have, I could pass that along to the confirmation desk for further research.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical "(including automatic termination, if applicable)" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

BP wants comfort that EOTT is not wholly owned by Enron.  A search of
corporate records indicates the following: The general partner of EOTT
Energy Canada Limited Partnership is EOTT Energy Corp. which is 100% owned
by Enron and the only limited partner is EOTT Energy Operating Limited
Partnership which is owned by ?????   That is the question we would like

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Lech -- As to the below, yes, please file as to the named AEP Operating Companies, which are each utilities involved in the production of electricity.  I attach a copy of the latest format of the agreement, and bring to your attention certain new parties shown in the first paragraph and as signatories, mostly U.K. and Canadian entities.  A newly listed U.S. AEP affiliate is Houston Pipe Line Company LP.

Although formally only two AEP entities are party to the MNA, AEPSC is
acting as agent for a number of affiliates.  This raises, to my mind at
least, the possibility that those subsidiaries would be considered the real
"debtors" for UCC purposes.

Accordingly, I believe the prudent course is to file against each named
subsidiary, as well as against  AEPSC and AEPSI.  To do so, we will need
the subsidiaries' respective addresses, jurisdictions of organization and
"organizational ID" number (if organized in Colorado, Delaware, Maryland or
Texas), and confirmation that each is, as certainly appears to be the case,
a "transmitting utility" under the UCC, i.e., an entity primarily engaged
in the production or transmission of electricity or the transmission of
goods through a pipeline.

Thank you.

Frank, 
Back in March, I believe you requested that we get a net settlement agreement in place.  I sent you a draft copy.  To date, I have not received a reply.  We would appreciate you review and get back to me if OK to have executed.  I understand we are exchanging 1100 BPD.
Thanks for your assistance.

As we discussed last week, attached is netting agreement for Electric Power.
In my opinion the agreement is standard in nature and as you should  agree,
in my opinion of course.  Please review and comment if you would like to
modify.  

As you know,  I will  be question frequently regarding the status of this
agreement,  therefore anything I can do to help complete this agreement in a
timely manner will be appreciated.

I will be transmitting later this afternoon new versions--do not use these, wait for the new ones.  We are trying to change some provisions to support some anticipated financings.

Marie, by copy of this memo, please add the above parties to the master netting email group ASAP.  Thanks.

FYI per my voice mail. 

There is an effort underway here in coordination with the credit dept. to put in place a host of netting agreements. Attached are the latest forms, but I understand they may be changing in some respects as a result additional line of credit facilities currently being put in place by Enron Corp. 

Please contact Mary or Carol (or me if you wish, although I'm not officially on the legal sredit team) regarding the coordination of the netting negoiations with trading partners worldwide.

Per Carol St. Clair, at this time, there is no urgency in finalizing and executing any master netting agreements.  No master netting agreement should be signed without Bill Bradford's or Louise Kitchen's prior approval.  If any questions, please contact either Carol or Elizabeth Sager.

Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see
attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced
AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to
masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading
affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the
AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc.
("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling
agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas,
physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit
group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical
synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please
contact me with any questions. -- David

Har,

As requested, I have attached the agreements in redline and in final.  I am
turning my attention to the Guaranty Agreements.

Not to beat a dead horse, and as John also mentioned, we will not accept
changes to this Master Agreement that alter the terms and conditions of the
Underlying Master Agreements.  At a later date, we will be happy to
negotiate in good faith concerning whether it would be mutually agreeable
to amend those Underlying Master Agreements.  This Master Setoff Agreement
is simply not the vehicle in which to accomplish that goal.

Regarding any concerns that this Master Agreement may not be enforceable in
Europe (or because it covers various Underlying Master Agreements for deals
in Europe), please note that Section 13 provides severability language that
should operate to carve out the European agreements that might otherwise
create enforceability problems.  Therefore, our approach has been to
include them since your colleagues have acknowledged that they do not know
whether there would be enforceability problems in Europe.

I look forward to discussing this final document with you at your earliest
convenience.  I will be seeking signatures from Pryor at 3:30.

Thanks.

Ernie

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Please note I made one additional change in Section 8.

Kate and Teresa:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various Enron entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

Enron Gas Processing Company
[Cole, Kate] 3/31/97 - Divested to KN Processing, Inc., subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. 

Enron Gas Marketing Canada
[Cole, Kate]  5/3/94 - Enron Gas Liquids Canada, Ltd. and Canadian Gas Marketing Inc. amalgamated with Enron Gas Marketing Canada Inc. to form Enron Gas Services Canada Corp.

Enron Oil Canada Ltd
[Cole, Kate]  Divested:
08/16/99 - Spun off to EOG Resources and changed its name to EOG Resources Canada Inc.
.
Enron Oil Corporation
[Cole, Kate]  10/19/95 - Dissolved.

Are these prior names of current Enron entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!

Attached are clean and redline versions of the "without margining" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Phil/Andrew

As promised, I am pleased to attach a form of netting agreement for your review, covering trades between ECTRL and BEPETL under their GTMA, Coal Master and potentially other trades between those entities.  

Note in particular:

 that the agreement is triggered by an event of bankruptcy (following the ISDA definition) in relation to either party or its affiliated credit support provider and requires the close out of both masters or neither of them (at the option of the non-defaulting party) - ie no "cherry-picking"

that in order to net the two masters, it was necessary to include a valuation methodology for coal trades (none was included in the Coal Master).

I look forward to receiving you comments on the attached as soon as possible.

Kind regards

Paul

Subject:	Master Netting Agreement Assignments...Identification of legal entities comprising your assigned "houses"

Based on the latest Master Netting Agreement Assignment List, you are assigned to one or more "houses" to prepare a Master Netting Agreement.  I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This "excisement" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-Enron legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete "house" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

Best Regards,
BNG

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

It sounds like you handed out things at the meeting besides the form of the
MNA and CA, such as an agenda, checklist, process, etc.  Can you send me
copies of what was handed out?

Resending, with the intended attachment. FYI, the Credit Support Annex has been removed and and portions of the Netting Agreement dealing with collateral have been altered, so that the Netting Agreement is mainly focused on installing setoff and cross default rights.

Subject:	AEP Master Netting Agr

Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the AEP Operating Companies ("AEP") and AEP Energy Services, Inc. ("AEPESI").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas, physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please contact me with any questions. -- David

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.

2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

Subject: BP Master Netting Agreement


Mr. Dixon:

Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.  I am working with Trey Cash and Melinda Winn to extract the receivables to enable the master netting agreements to be executed.  For now, please touch base with me prior to initialing any master netting that includes power.  Please note we are still working on the extraction from the gas receivables as well.

Does ECC have any physical gas masters with J. Aron & Company?  If not, can you send me a sample gtc used?

Thanks!

I just spoke with Elizabeth Sager and she said there was no need to
order lien searches for AEP as the contract expires in March, 2002.

Mary/Carol

As requested, I am providing the list of counterparties with whom we are working on netting arrangements and the status.  

Coastal States Trading-	Under progress to implement payment and default netting.  Enron revisions 			requested and awaiting Coastal feedback.  Expected to be non-controversial.  I 			have spoken with Brent Hendry and he is comfortable with proceeding 				on this basis and will also proceed with Master Netting Agreement.
ConAgra-	            Expected  to execute by end of the week. (Master Crude Oil P&S with CSA)
Conoco- 		Executed by both parties (only payment netting)
Crown Central-		Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Crown for completion of execution. (only 			payment netting requested in their draft)
Morgan Stanley- 	Executed by both parties. (only close-out netting)
Sunoco-		Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Sunoco for completion of execution. (only 			payment netting requested in their draft)
Valero-			Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Valero. (only payment netting requested in 			their draft)
Williams-		Under progress to implement payment netting for crude trading.  I have discussed 			this with Jeff Hodge and he is comfortable with proceeding on this basis, but will 			proceed with Master Netting Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Jason, do you need to be involved in this one?  Let me know.   Marie, please assign this one to an attorney to assist London as needed.  Assign to Alan Aronowitz.

Subject:	Cross Affiliate Netting Agreement - RWE

Mary,

I am in Marcus von Bock?s group in Legal/London and together with Pat Cini (Credit/London) am negotiating a Netting Agreement for physical gas and power, as well as a Cross Affiliate Netting Agreement for physical and financial transactions with RWE Trading GmbH.

The Enron entities involved are 

Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited
Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp
Enron Financial Energy Trading LLC

There are two issues:

We will have to prepare a board resolution with regard to the corporate benefit/appropriate consideration of the agreement to the various entities. For ECTRIC and EFET would you want to take a look at this ?

Pursuant to Section 8 (e) of the Cross Affiliate Netting Agreement (draft attached) we are making a representation regarding the non existence of any lien or other encumbrance on the rights to any amounts owed to us under the underlying agreements. Who would assist with a lien search regarding the US entities ?

 

We are looking to close these agreements by Monday or Tuesday.

Regards,

Michael
