 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in 
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our 
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar 
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % 
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, 
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, 
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim 
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do 
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt

Shonnie, it was nice meeting you at the Law Conference last week.  As I 
mentioned to you then, I have been in the Legal Department of EES on a 
contract basis since last August.  I report to Jim Keller.  My assignment 
here is winding up and I am looking for my next assignment.  

I have spent the bulk of my time at EES negotiating gas and power commodity 
transactions.  Before I joined EES I developed model agreements for EI.

I have taken the liberty of attaching my resume here for your consideration, 
or for circulation among your colleagues.  I would appreciate an opportunity 
to talk with you further.  Please feel free to talk to Jim.

Thanks,
Melinda Winn

You will love me after this request........

Richard, we have several form contracts being developed and used in EBS that 
include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting 
agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with 
any questions or comments.

In keeping with Mike Moran's instructions to be frugal, I did not book a 
video conference at Enron, but I have asked Linda Guinn to find one that we 
can attend in Houston.

Subject: Potential need for press release

The California Power Exchange (PX) is likely to issue a letter to its market 
participants indicating that Enron has broken the PX's rules by purposefully 
overscheduling an intertie causing congestion and a market price increase.  
The attached FERC complaint opposing PX action is probably not in final form 
yet, but I wanted to get you in the loop because it may be filed with FERC as 
soon as tomorrow.   The complaint explains that the PX tariff contains no 
prohibition against overscheduling and the California Independent System 
Operator, not the PX, schedules congestion over interties.  Further, under 
FERC precedent, without prior FERC review, the Cal PX should not be issuing 
letters finding violations.  Finally, the PX's analysis is seriously flawed 
because it doesn't consider market rules that actually caused the congestion 
and any potentially related price increase.  

We are very concerned about the PX's actions because we believe California 
utilities may be awaiting this letter to sue EPMI  (estimated claims ranging 
between $6 million and $47 million).  We probably want to aggressively 
publicise the filing so our side of the story comes out instead of the PX's.  
We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the PX where they will likely tell 
us if they will be issuing the letter.  Call me if you have any questions: 
(503) 464-8862.

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't 
many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might 
be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  
of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that 
much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back 
up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as 
one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc 
office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i 
could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of 
him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of 
course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new 
york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york 
bar as are about 8 of our partners.

>>> <Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com> 05/15/01 03:44PM >>>
I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

Candy

I spoke to Steve and Gerald  about this last week.  On the monies they owed 
us under the gas lift contract, we gave them until May 10th to respond or we 
would institute litigation.  The attorney for HH, Jim Williams, called me 
last week and basically laid it out that HH sold all of its assets to White 
Oak back in December (and we already had been so informed by White Oak), that 
HH doesn't have any assets left and we could go after the principals if we 
wanted but they probably wouldn't even file an answer and we could just get a 
judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased.  He offered 
a flat settlement amount of $15,000 on our claim of $35,284.95.  Steve has 
given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about 
settling the $11,000.00 claim for the line repairs.  Quite honestly, I don't 
hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than $15,000 but that is 
$15,000 more than we have right now.  Also, since Gerald was working on the 
gas lift debt, I've asked him to notify credit and put HH and its principals 
on the credit risk list so that we don't do any more deals with them.

As I recall, we were trying to muscle HH into paying that invoice for line 
repairs via you, Richard.  Had we decided to abandon our efforts due to their 
adamant denial of liability and refusal to pay?  It's really not enough money 
to go to court over.

Pls advise.

There is currently an invoice still outstanding from Houston Hydrocarbons.  
Here are the details:

Date of invoice:  12/9/98
Amount:  $11,775.86
Re:  Cost incurred to repair your 2" pipeline known as Fagin-O'Connor in 
Victoria County, Texas.

The invoice was sent to the attention of Robert Lemax.

Before I attempt to call them to collect, I thought I would contact you to 
see if there are any outstanding issues with Houston Hydrocarbons, such as an 
impending deal, a bankruptcy, etc...  Let me know if you have any insight.

Thanks for your assistance.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

Richard:
 In looking at the Natole file today it was brought to my attention that we
have an outstanding bill for legal fees and expenses unpaid from February.

 The bill is invoice 00020782 dated 2/29/00 in the amount of $17,312.28.

 Could you please have someone look for this one and see if it can be
approved for payment?  Thanks in advance for your help.

 Best regards,

 Bill Ogden

Joe Eisenberg just floated a trial balloon with me.  Joe is at risk of losing 
the CFO and counsel, something I reported yesterday.  On top of that, the 
creditors committee is balking at spending a part of the approximately $20 
million of "unencumbered" cash to keep the doors open and generate numbers 
that only benefit participants.  Joe is thinking about a liquidating plan.  
He didn't have all the details, but he did mention several points.  Some 
amount would be set aside to pay the trade debt.  He used a $5 million 
number.  The total unsecured debt (not including participants' claims) could 
be as much as $20 million if rejection damages are included, so those 
creditors would stand to get around 25%.  The balance of the cash, after 
paying administrative costs, would go, directly or indirectly, for the 
benefit of participants.  The litigation and claims resolution would be under 
the control of the participants.  Some of the cash would pay for accounting 
work.  Other cash would pay for prosecution of litigation claims under the 
direction of a committee.  In the end, whatever cash remains together with 
any recoveries from litigation, would presumably be distributed to 
participants.  I assume the plan would designate some individual to supervise 
the wind up process.  The participants committee could remain in existence to 
supervise the process.  If we structured such a plan, we'd try to push it to 
confirmation quickly, assuming support from the creditors committee.  The 
option may be appointment of a trustee.  We should discuss our preference so 
that I can get back to Eisenberg promptly.

Actually, I said I did not think we should pursue it, but that I wanted Harry 
to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it 
go. We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about. 
Any word Harry?

As you can see from the attached this may not be the best week in San Diego

We have been informed by the building management that our building is on the

9.  We don't know exactly when this will happen and we probably will not get 
further warning.  Most likely it will last about an hour.  Be sure to save 
computer work product frequently.  Shut your computer off if you are not 
going to use it  and try to close out of programs when not in use.

We should have continuation of phone service as there is  a backup battery.  
You should stay and work if you can, however, we will not have HVAC so if the

after an hour with building security to see if the power has been restored.

By the way, when I spoke Marty Penkwitz yesterday, who had been working the 
OEC - MESC deal to date, he did not think we needed to be present or that we

		 Subject: Izower Deposition Day 1




Tom Hatch concluded his examination of Aron Izower today.? Lawyers for the 
other plaintiffs will begin tomorrow.? Izower was a first-year lawyer at 
White & Case when he began working on the NSM offering in Oct. 1997.? The 
senior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms 
or retired.

Highlights: 

--Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their 
description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo's 
description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate 
with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag 
or Klockner were "obligated" to purchase NSM's steel.? Izower's counsel 
objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? 

--Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements 
and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the "underwriting group."? 
Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher 
Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility 
schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion 
dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in 
the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and 
Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.

--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence 
of certain material agreements such as: 
a)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and 
Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they 
received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;

b)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to 
which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had 
an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from 
the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and 
take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM's ability to import and export 
materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing 
fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in 
the offering memo as it may not have qualified as "related party transaction."

--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM 
deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.

Subject: Draft Hague Convention

Richard,

Rob has asked for some input on the proposed Draft Hague Convention relating 
to jurisdiction and the enforcement of foreign judgments.   One of the new 
proposals could have implications for trading.   The proposal would arguably 
subject a company to suit in a jurisdiction where it has an accessible 
website for conducting e-commerce.   However, under the Convention this grant 
of jurisdiction would apparently (I am still studying this) be overridden by 
a contractually-agreed forum selection clause.  Do our current e-business 
contracts contain a forum selection clause?  Would you anticipate that we 
would conduct trades in the future without a previously-agreed forum 
selection clause?

Thanks for your help.

We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th. Why not bring them all. We can 
get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will)
As for the Perd, we are definitely coming. I invited John and Yvonne but they 
cannot come. Doug and Susan may be coming. Someone needs to call Steve and 
Jane Ellen---would you do this. We will come Fri. morning.
p.s.---
I have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this Easter egg 
hunt is all about two times and I cannot make heads or tails of it.

for is April 20th and 21st. ?We are invited to both the rehearsal dinner and  
the wedding, which is at the Houstonian. ? 

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner,  
so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for  
the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of  
them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? 
Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do  
that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. 

Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would  
be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I  
stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know  
that I am asking alot. 

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was  
coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We  
will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? 
There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I 
think  
it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will 
give  
some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at 
the  
Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is  
better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and  
come back for the night. 

When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals. ?I would be happy to  
grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel 
like  
having. 

Anyway, I will talk with you later.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for "Year 1" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for "Year 35" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly "running in the other direction" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied "mid-stream" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged "contract year" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month "Year 35" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a "global" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the "excess" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS "self bills" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
"overpayments" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the "excess" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?


Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of "Contract Capacity Factor" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage "haircut" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years "and thereafter from year to year," unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective "at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter." (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain "stub" years and certain "long" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying "calendar year" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
"contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

To bring you guys up to date:

I met with VE and AA on Thursday to discuss assign responsibility for 
appropriate sections of the document.  VE is editing "the Exchange Offer", is 
coordinating edits to "Regulation" with the original ENE drafters of the 
section.  ECP is responsible for drafting/editing the remainder of the 
document.

We discussed a number of relevant issues:
Is this document a "post effective amendment" to the original S-4 filed 12/15 
given that we will not be registering additional securities.  VE is going to 
follow up with our examiner at the exchange to determine if we still have an 
Edgar filing number.  I suspect the answer is no.  VE is also going to 
discuss our approach with the examiner to give him the heads up on what we 
are doing.
Is disclosure of the recap required?  After conversation with Doug Bland we 
came to the conclusion that no disclosure was required.   This was based on 
the facts that 1). no agreement has been entered into.  There is not a term 
sheet etc.  2).  We will need lender consent.
There will be disclosure of the Infineum litigation.  See below for draft 
language.  Please forward any comments to me.

Timing:
Monday evening - turn changes though the F pages Monday evening.
Mon/Tues - AA begins SAS 71 review 
Late Tuesday - distribute document (w/o F pages) for preliminary internal 
review. Licato, Evans, Stappenbeck, Keevill, Plants, Mellencamp, Lydecker
Thursday/Friday - Turn F pages


Infineum Litigation
On June 30, 2000, Infineum USA L.P. filed an action against us in the United 
States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking an unspecified 
amount of actual and punitive damages relating to our steam sale agreements 
with Infineum and Bayway Refining.  Infineum's petition claims that our 
existing energy services agreement with Tosco and the related amendment to 
the steam sale agreement with Bayway, interferes with Infineum's ability to 
sell to Bayway steam that Infineum purchases from our Linden facility.  
Infineum calims that such interference is in violation of federal and New 
Jersey antitrust laws, is in breach of our agreement with Infineum and 
tortiously interferes with Infineum's economic relationships with Bayway.  We 
believe the claims made in this litigation are without merit and we intend to 
defend these actions vigorously.  Although no assurances can be given, we 
believe that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word 
document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed 
automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been 
telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if 
they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention 
period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

Milberg Weiss is the main plaintiffs' counsel. They are a well known (and

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Regards
Delainey

		 Subject: Document retention, etc.

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.

Janice

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:       Kansas JDT Participants
From:    Don Schultz
Re:       Late-Breaking Developments

             The Kansas Coordinating Counsel Committee met by telephone
today following the decision by Judge Downes granting the Quinque
Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand.   Here are highlights.

              1.   JDT-wide conference call next Wednesday, January 17,
at 2 p.m. Central.  Dial-in instructions are as follows:

Dial-in:  800-403-1026
Participant code:  305486

              2.   Kansas counsel will confer with committee on
scheduling issues on Monday to discuss approaches to court or
plaintiffs' counsel on schedule issues, such as new common answer/motion
date and discovery deadlines or stay.  Participants will receive
separate dial-in instructions.  This group will report to JDT at large
in Wednesday call.
               3.  Kansas motion committees will confer on Tuesday to
review status of dismissal motions on personal jurisdiction and
non-personal jurisdiction grounds.   Participants will receive separate
announcement of call and dial-in instructions.  This group will also
report to JDT at large in Wednesday call.
              4.   Preliminary research shows any rehearing application
needs to be on file before Judge mails order to remand case.  Judge
intends to mail order on Tuesday, January 16th.  (Law appears split on
whether rehearing can be entertained at all, but is clear any
application must be in before mailing).

Bruce Oakley has informed me that we will be filing a motion to compel 
arbitration, which should stay Sitler's ability to take any depositions. 
Either Bruce or I will let you know if it looks like the depositions will 
proceed.

Tom Campbell, the attorney in Licking County that filed our answer for the
Sitler complaint, called me to advise that Sitler's atty has requested a
deposition with Ken, myself, and Jud Byrd - one per week, beginning in
February.  I spoke with John Keller this morning, who is aware of this, and
has advised Bruce Oakley in Houston.

John told me to go ahead and give Tom some dates, and be cooperative, even
though it may not go forward.  I told John I would let you know what was
going on.  Call if you have any questions.

The interest rate is fine. We do not  agree to "loser pays" attys fees. The 
arbitrator has discretion under AAA rules to award attys fees, so we usually 
leave it open. I would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court 
for some relief outside the arbitration. Please let me know if you have any

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy
Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity
which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and
the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating
power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the
California Power Exchange.
 11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter "NRG") is a Minneapolis,
Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately
sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In
partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating
plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California
Power Exchange.
12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter "AES") is an Arlington,
Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which
is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the
class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity
generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity
to the California Power Exchange.
13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public
corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy
Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale
electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including
plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern
California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power
Exchange.
14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter "Duke Energy") is a
Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of

including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates
four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.
/ / /
  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Yes. I am the contact person at Enron. The LLGM attys should send me copies 
of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers, 
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As for 
contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them directly 
for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made through me. I 
would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial 
calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because of time 
constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

Richard:  Could you let me know at your convenience if you should be the 
contact person for any LeBoeuf lawyer with respect to any correspondence, 
papers, questions, etc. in this matter.  Do you want us to be sending any 
drafts of court papers that we prepare, for example, to ECP simultaneously 
with sending them to you or after you have reviewed them?  I assume our 
litigators can contact the ECP folks directly to obtain any information or 
other materials that they may need, but please let me know if you would 
rather that they work through you.  Thanks, Richard.  I hope that all is 
going well.  John

		 Subject: In re M/V HAVMANN

Richard,

I have confirmed with David Best this morning that the settlement in this 
matter is "done and dusted", to use David's phrase.  I have received, and 
will shortly send to you, a letter from our underwriters' counsel, confirming 
the settlement.  Payment will be made within twenty-one days, which means 
before year-end.  Our barrister and expert have been advised to stop work 
immediately.  Parenthetically, we were able to avoid becoming liable for the 
7,500 pound advance to our barrister that would have otherwise come due last 
Friday.

Let me know if you want me to participate in a conference with John Nowlan to 
explain our reasons for the settlement.  By the way, this finally wraps up 
all the M/V HAVMANN arbitration/litigation.  Best advises that there is no 
one left for us to pursue, and no one left who is pursuing us.

One question:  Best wants to know if you want the $475,000 to come directly 
to us, or to come to him, and to be disbursed to us by him net of agreed fees 
and expenses that we owe.  One way or another, I assume that you ultimately 
want the money wired to us, but I wonder if you know of a person (or 
department) from whom to determine the proper wire transfer account/address.  
If not, I am sure that I can find out.  Thanks.

Britt

Have received and reviewed the Plaintiff's First Amended Petition relative to 
the above.  Please note this matter is subject to Gulf Company's insurance, 
subject to the following reservation of rights, given the allegation of  
"personal injury" which is defined in part as:

Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or 
organization or disparages a person's or organizations goods, products or 
services.

As such, we would have an obligation to defend the entire lawsuit, even the 
allegations associated with "breach of contract".   Our obligation to defend 
this matter in its entirety would cease in the event the covered count of 
slander and defamation were to be dismissed.

With respect to indemnity, we will only respond to an award for damages which 
(1) flows from the allegation of slander and defamation, and (2) which were 
not made with knowledge that they were false.

Our obligation to pay defense costs begins today.  Please advise if counsel 
has already been retained given what has been submitted for review is the 
Plaintiff's First Amended Petition.  If counsel has already been retained, 
then they will need to be issued our standard Engagement Agreement, and 
should be instructed to begin a new billing cycle today.  Please see that 
they provide you with a copy of their entire file.

Please call in the event you have any questions.  I trust you will share this 
email with the appropriate operating company, and counsel for Mr. Randall 
Maffett so they are aware of same.

Can we talk tomorrow (Fri) morning your time about the indemnity/contribution
memorandum and how we should be proceeding vis-avis settlement and possibly
cross-complaining against the other defendants?

If so, what time would be convenient for you?

The phone call to Intermesa and Votorantim should emphasize the following 
points:

1. The transaction was never consumated.  We have consistently stated that we 
do not consider the transaction a   "done deal" until final documents are 
executed.

2. We are no longer willing to consider the proposed transaction.  The reason 
is simple:  the market has moved and they failed to act quickly.

3. All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive.  Because 
Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final   documents, it accepted the 
risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be 
willing to sign a deal.

4. Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal. Their only claim is that we 
misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they 
didn't pursue negotiations with a third party. Our response is: we never made 
any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to  rely on our negotiations as 
a basis to forego discussions with third parties when Enron never sent them a 
binding offer.

Richard-

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

John

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Subject: Litigation Counsel Approval - Lakeside Packers

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

USA: Enron earnings rise 31 percent, beat expectations.

(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually 
anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI 
litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is

 He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.  
 What happened at the meeting on Monday with Mark?  Do I still have a job?

Coho Energy Files Suit Against Hicks Muse Affiliates

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 27, 1999--Coho Energy Inc. (Nasdaq:COHO - news)
today announced that it has filed suit against five affiliates of
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst seeking damages of more than five hundred million
dollars ($500,000,000).

The suit, which was filed on Coho's behalf in state court by the noted Dallas
trial firm of Thomas & Culp, L.L.P., alleges that HM4, a limited partnership
formed by Hicks Muse on behalf of the Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Equity Fund 
IV,
reneged on a contract to inject $250,000,000 of equity capital into the 
Company.
 The deal would have
given HM4 control of Coho through the purchase of 41,666,666 shares of newly
issued common stock at $6.00 per share.

The suit alleges that HM4 waited until after Coho's public stockholders had
approved the agreement, then reneged on the deal at the last minute in order 
to
renegotiate the price down to $4.00
per share in order to increase the number of shares that HM4 would have 
received
 for the $250,000,000. Then according to the allegations, HM4 walked away from
the new agreement.

The Company has opened a Web page at www.coholawsuit.com in order to keep the
public and its stockholders informed of progress in the case. The petition 
filed
 in court will be available in
full text at the Web site at approximately 2:00 p.m., CDT, today.

In order to resolve our warranty issues under the outstanding invoices with 
SWPC (both before and after our purchase), I request that Milbank Tweed be 
engaged for a limited review of the documentiation surrounding the issues 
(including warranty, consequential damage, incremental labor coverage).  
Milbank has a depth of project experience on project construction and 
equipment suppliers and their agreements.  I would propose the West Coast 
office and allow Ed Feo to select the appropriate personnel.

While I beleive that Milbank is not the only firm that can perform this 
engagement adequately, I do believe that they could be timely and cost 
efficient on a issue as largely commercial issue as this.  Please let me know 
your view as we need to resolve our options, and ultimately our course of 
action next week.

I spoke with Becky Noecker re Great Lakes. It is primarily a Canadian
pipeline transporting Canadian gas to the US. It transports a little
Michigan production but not from federal leases and it does not measure that
gas for royalty purposes. Great Lakes raised this informaly with Figa and
his response was to list many things Great Lakes would have to prove in
order for Grynberg to dismiss. Great Lakes then sent a notice letter for
Rule 11 purposes and Figa dismissed rather than allowing the Rule 11 motion
to be filed.  Becky also asked me what we'd found out about whether Boies
new partner has done any Enron work. Any news on that front?

kruptcy matters


Richard,
 Here is the status of the information we have about the City of Palo
Alto's request that our firm represent them in connection with the potential
bankruptcy of PG&E.  It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has
agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse
in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from
representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue
to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to
our firm confidential information.  In particular, if Enron and the City of
Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity
litigation  (including class actions, governmental investigations and the
recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E
for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron
even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo
Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely
they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized
expertise of Larry Engel.  The City of Palo Alto has its own generation
capacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (the
Northern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority of
Northern California).  The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron,
as I understand it.  We have specifically identified the City and County of
San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining that
suit.

 Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposed
bankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?

Thanks
Gary

I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just 
left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me 
this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it 
is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it 
is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the 
document.
Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 
3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up 
with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of 
course you can always call Kevin.

Richard

Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 
wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  
Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease 
Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from 
HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases 
from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, 
we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.

Gentlemen,

To the extent that you are aware, I would be grateful if you could let me 
know where we stand on the settlement of the claim with Interfert, which as I 
recall had been settled as to liability (but unresolved as to quantum).  We 
are unable to finalise the liquidation of Enron Gas Liquids Europe until this 
claim is settled.

Many Thanks.
Justin

Sheila and Karen,

As you requested, our accounting department has not been following up on our
outstanding invoices -- which at this point total about $700,000 (see
attached).  Sheila, I gather you told Barry you would try to get us current
before the end of November.  That would be great if you can do it.  (I can
give you wire info if you need it.)  If we don't make November (I know
you're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us that
we get caught up by year end.  Let me or Barry know if there's anything we
need to do.

Subject: Litigation report

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on 
behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we 
summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases 
as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside 
counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will 
need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have 
been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. 
Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have 
been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile ("Codelco" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG 
and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state 
copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but 
also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts 
on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the 
main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim 
from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, 
which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has 
NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document 
and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made 
subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 
5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, 
High Court proceedings take place in public.

 - LT010810084_3.doc


2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client 
contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 
2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. 
Solicitors: Clyde & Co.


3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses 
believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as 
preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar 
inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with 
Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally 
(and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent 
offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to 
unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  
LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being 
established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and 
have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent 
basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by 
Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume 
possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting 
advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become 
sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known 
to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME 
warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves 
significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in 
arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH 
(and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed 
the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that 
case. He never told me that he would be filing anything. In fact, he asked me 
to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were 
still looking at what to do.

I just spoke with Koury and he was anything but reasonable.  He has already
filed an application in the Iowa courts for guardianship and conservatorhip
of Alexis, even though the Iowa Code gives parental preference, which is a
difficult preference to overcome.  Also, the Iowa court doesn't have
jurisdiction until Texas says it does.  He said he told you about some case
he took to the Iowa Supreme Court where the Court granted a grandfather
possession and conservatorship over the father who was an out of state
resident.  Do you remember that?

Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys 
working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy 
over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation

		 Subject: CalPX is going to court to have PG&E's ISO payment put in escrow

Earlier this week, PG&E paid $177 million to the ISO.  The ISO has not 
distributed that money to creditors because of the Enron v. CalPX suit.  As 
documented in an earlier e-mail, Chris Stokley, Murray O'Neill, and I called 
the ISO's treasurer and explained that the judge's order expressly excluded 
payments to the CAISO from the PX's general right not to pay creditors.

The ISO now informs us that the CalPX plans to have PG&E's payment 
transferred to the PX into an escrow account.  I copied the key part of the 
ISO's document below, and the full document is attached.


"Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC 
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied 
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has 
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are 
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in 
federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. 
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central District 
of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within 
the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX 
for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary 
Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest 
bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court."

I think we all would agree that the money belongs to ISO creditors, and that 
the PX has no claim on these funds.  My guess is that the PX would like to 
have this money so that it can deduct administrative expenses from it.  

If I can provide more information on this, let me know.

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

We do utilize this feature.  How often it is used varies from assistant to 
assistant.  You would need to have access to a system computer or at the very 
least have the document transferred to diskette.   In the past we have not 
given up anything from our system computers.   Since we give nothing but hard 
copies, is this a problem for us?  Further, our retention policy states that 
all drafts are to be discarded once the deal has been completed.  

Would you like to see a demonstration of the track changes feature?

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.

Janice

Richard:  when Carl and I were down in HN a few weeks ago and met with you 
and Mark, Mark had suggested a meeting on May 9th in HN to discuss all of the 
status of all of the litigation matters and to coordinate with the various 
filings being made and anticipated to be made in the bankruptcy court by EPMI 
in the PG&E case and in the PX case (or through the Creditors or Participants 
Committees).  Do you know if that meeting in HN is still on or has that 
meeting in person been "overtaken" by the Thursday afternoon litigation 
update calls?  Thanks  John

Here are the results of our efforts so far:

Discussions with Local Counsel:
 Here is the list of firms and individuals that we have contacted as
well as the results of conflict checks and availability.  In short, There
are some conflict issues with several of the firms.  One firm was directly
conflicted.  Another has as one of its partners, the wife of Len Simon, the
lead plaintiff's counsel in our case.  Assuming that conflicts can be
resolved, we have five different lawyers available to be interviewed on
Monday.

 <<status11.30.doc>>
Economic Experts

 Local

  Retained:  Carey P.  Mack,  Bruno & Mack
  The best testifying expert in town, economic accounting
damages.  Relates best to San Diego jury.   Not an anti-trust
model building type of expert.

  Tom Lambert
   Solo (he is checking conflict list right now.  If no
conflict, he is willing to work for us.)

  Broadshatzer, Wallace, Spoon & Yip
   Roberta Spoon (on vacation)
 National
  Charles River
    Gordon Rausser will be meeting with CEO of
Enron, Ken Lay on other matters on Friday 10:00a.m. in Houston on another
matter.  They are very interested in being retained.  They are doing
conflict check. He is willing to stop by and see you if that would be
helpful.
  NERA
   Waiting for response

Non-testifying Consultants

 Larry Ruff
  RETAINED: to assist in reviewing EPMI data.

Procedural Issues:

 We are investigating to see whether there are any California
defendants to consider removal.  Because we  attended  the press
conference (momentarily and obtained a copy of the complaint) we should
assume that  the removal clock is ticking.
News Reports

 We have identified a service that has recorded the news reports
about this lawsuit.  There are 28 hits so far for TV reports.  It will cost
$300 per clip to obtain them.  Do you know if Enron is getting these clips
from the public relations firm?  Should we get them?

Anti-Trust Law School Professors.

 We have identified Tom Campbell (ran against Diane Feinstein for
Senate.  We have a number for him in Washington good until tomorrow.  He was
former Director Competitive Compliance Division FTC, has Harvard Ph.D. in
Economics.  Should we contact him?

Thanks
Gary

		 Subject: Eastern District of Texas Gas Royalty Cases

This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas 
royalty cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before 
Judge Hannah.  Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a 
defendant.  Both cases are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The 
allegations are similar to those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The 
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil 
Oil Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing 
Southeast, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and 
Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. 

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs 
are Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, 
WI.  The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production 
Company, Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading 
Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the 
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of 
Houston, signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at 
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested 
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker 
told me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped 
as defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were 
named in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again 
named as defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed 
on June 13, 2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the 
plaintiffs, had a conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron 
and EOG to preserve the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 
13 complaint is not yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.

I don't know the Merit case. As for Badack, ENA has filed suit and moved for 
Summary Judgment on liability.The hearing will take place in the next month. 
On Thursday  Oct 12th, I met with  Badack's outside attys re settlement. 
Badack offered $2.375 mm. ENA's last offer was $5.0mm. We agreed to exchange 
additional offers. Is this update enough?

Attached is a brief memo from Rogelio-Lopez Velarde concerning the Court of 
Appeals that will hear the appeal of the Amparo proceeding in which Enron 
Energia Industrial de Mexico is an interested party.  We are fortunate that 
this Court has heard, and denied, two prior appeals of virtually-identical 
Amparo proceedings.

The meeting yesterday among Rogelio Lopez-Velarde, Jorge Canals (Enron's 
litigator) and Bill Wieland went well.  Bill indicated that he hoped to be 
able to provide his opinion by this afternoon.

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.

After further thought, it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation 
w/ American Coal, we should keep the documents. To further insulate the Coal 
Group and you from any claim that Enron misused the information,I suggest 
that you transfer the information to me and I will hold it for safekeeping.

Jay,

As I mentioned, I had met with Richard Sanders and Andy Edison earlier today, 
and they recommend that we respond to Ron's latest letter.  Richard tells me 
that, in litigation, much is made of the fact that a party did not respond to 
another's correspondence.  As you can see, I have kept the response short 
rather than rehash and contradict once more each of Ron's numerous 
inaccuracies and self-serving statements.

Pete

Project Stanley tapes were destroyed.

NGX is covered - we continue to negotiate a commercial solution which will 
see EOL data included in the index - had a meeting Friday and we are getting 
closer.

The shaved head is Powell's deal - can you believe a guy shaving his head 
just to suck up for a promotion?

Peter.

Did we ever destroy these tapes?
Also-- I am assuming that NGX is well covered and that you don't need any 
help. If not, please let me know. Perhaps I can get info from Mark Powell--by 
the way is there some sort of fashion trend in Canada invoving shaved heads?

Talked with Tom Deen today. He wants to depose either Miller or Virgo on 3/9
and the other of them the next day, Friday 3/10. I said I'd check their
availability. Can you advise? He also said he wanted to depose another Enron
employee whom he claims actually went to Korea: one Harry Moltreu (sp.?)
Any idea who this is? He agrees on mediating the last 2 weeks in March, and
to a continuance of the April setting. He also confirmed that Natole had
sold either all or part of his business, but retained all interest in the
lawsuit. I said we'd want to go through this in Natole's deposition, and he
said they would have the details then. Natole is on for next Friday 2/18.

I spoke w/ Steve Hamilton (Pres/CEO) about co-signing the letter and although 
he agrees with the content, etc... he's a bit reluctant.  His concern is that 
if JB somehow pulls together the money to take us out, he will be 
ostracized.  What are your thoughts?  Is it still ok for me to send it as a

Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
place.

Here is yet another request for e-mail from a long time ago.  Apparently EI 
has these old tapes somewhere (at least Roberto and the users think they 
do).  Any word from Richard Sanders?

Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill 
Gage
today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think they are
shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had talked to
you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made and that I
would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's # is

Richard -

I understand we'll be meeting next week.  I figured one of the first things 
you'd be asking me for is an accounting on what Enron spent on the power 
plant, so I thought I'd pre-empt you and send it in advance. 

Chris

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,
Frank

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

		 Subject: Power Systems

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Regards
Delainey

I have not heard  from Barbara about Eitan, but my reaction is that he is not 
a great fit because of his lack of legal experience. Typically, we don't hire 
first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) 
them. I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings 
might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced. However, I know  
that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical.

Richard:

My view is that TVA will likely use the FERC ruling to attempt to
retroactively bless their treatment of the Enron control areas last summer.
Although my understanding is that Entergy used a different method than that
employed by TVA to restrict the use of a no-load control area, TVA will
argue that the result is the same and that NERC has, thus, approved
differing treatment for load and no-load control areas.  The FERC ruling
will likely create a greater sense of unease on the part of the judge to
enforce the rules of NERC, a voluntary association, in the face of what
appears at first blush to be a contrary position taken by FERC, a federal
agency.

Bob

P.S. T.O. Helton has suggested that he sit in on the upcoming depositions of
Richard Shen and the 30(b)(6) rep. on TVA's alleged damages to get a better
feel for the case.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to
the
control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that
although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron
has
no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of winning?

 By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to
comment
on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

Do you think we should appeal Entergy source and sink FERC order?  While I
think
it is a poorly written order that shows a lack of understanding of the
issue,
I'm not sure that we can win on appeal or that it is worth appealing, since
we
would not recover our damages against ComEd and TVA for this summer while
the
order is in effect.  It would be helpful next summer to be able to park in
ComEd
and TVA, since the RTOs will not be running in all likelihood.

Elizabeth/Richard -- Is there a reason in the TVA litigation  that we need
to
appeal the decision?

Otherwise, Joe, should we get Dan W. to draft a memo on chances of success
or
other reasons for filing an appeal?

Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron

engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be

It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or
why it is being made at this time.  I thought that we had gotten over this
hump.

Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them
that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the
temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we
will be back in touch further.

Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will
allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet
wet.

Agree?

Richard,
 I contacted Al Alexanderson at Portland General as you suggested to
set up a meeting with the Portland General traders to learn about their
trading strategies.  This will probably happen some time next week.  In my
discussion with Al, they have taken the approach of creating a supply stack
for all of their OOM and bids over $150 and are applying a most expensive
first approach to establishing cost basis for FERC and other requests.  I
think it makes sense to look at what they have done and see how their
proposal would work on EPMI data and vice versa.  Do you concur?

Thanks
Gary

Richard,

Bob is taking John and Bill to Damien's for lunch on Thursday, May 24.  He 
wanted me to find out if you would like to go with them.  It will have to be 
at 11:30 a.m. because Vicki Sharp has a 1:00 p.m. meeting.  Thanks.

Memorandum

Enron's performance has been exceptional.  This performance is reflected in=

To this end, we are initiating a number of organization and staffing change=
s=20
in these businesses and related changes in the Enron Office of the Chairman=
,=20
in Corporate Staff groups, and in a number of management/personnel=20
committees.  Other business units, EOG, GPG, PGE, and Azurix, will not be=

immediately.

Enron Office of the Chairman

Joe Sutton will join the Office of the Chairman as Vice Chairman.  In his n=

on Enron's Board of Directors.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses=
=20
and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an=20
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation=
=20
and performance review across all units.  Each global function will provide=
=20
its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these=
=20
functions is a new technology function, which will focus on information=20

General Counsel
 Risk Assessment and Control:  Rick Buy, EVP
 Accounting and HR:  Rick Causey, EVP and Chief Accounting Officer

 Other Staff Groups:  Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff
 Corporate Development:  To be determined.

Committees

=20
and Operating Committees.  Membership will be as follows:

 Ken Lay, Chairman
 Jeff Skilling, Alternate Chairman
 Joe Sutton
           Stan Horton
Jim Bannantine         Kurt Huneke
 Cliff Baxter         Larry Izzo

Subject: Conversation with John Flory-CalPX -- Attorney -client Privilege

As requested by Joe Hartsoe, I put in a call to John Flory yesterday.

John called me back today.  He said the view in the PX is that Enron is 
stalling.  I gave him the other side of the story.  He thinks nothing will be 
done until the next Market Monitoring COm meeting later this month (the PX 
web site does not list the date),  He says the matter will likely be 
discussed in Executive Session.  He also believes that the PX wants to meet 
with Enron and isn't likely to do anything publicly until after that meeting.

Unfortunately, from talking to John, the perception at the PX appears to be 
that this matter should be handled like the Chicago Board of Trade where they 
monthly release a list of offenders and what they have done, and nobody 
thinks much about it.  It's routine.  That's the wat they want these to be in 
the future, but they realize that this one -- the first -- will seem much 
bigger than that because it is first.

He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really 
didn't have any process set up to handle these things.  He said the 
compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov 
(although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).  We also 
aren't being picked on.  Other people are being investigated, but we're 
coming through first.  I asked about utility pressure.  He said he has been 
asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has 
caused any undue pressure on the PX.  He said, if they were being pressured, 
the investigation would have been completed by now.

He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it 
has, but they can't ignore it.  A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just 
can't be ignored, he said.

I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I 
feel I can call him for updates at any time.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=
e=20
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=
=20
carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=
ne=20
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=
he=20
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits=
=20
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=
=20
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years=
=20
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=
=20
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =
or=20
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=
=20
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=
=20
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=
=20
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=
=20
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=
n=20
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=
 =20
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=
e=20
OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=
n=20
its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20
authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=
n.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=
=20
Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20
proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=
=20
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=
=20
indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20
elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=
y,=20
due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,=
=20
with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=
ng=20
PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=
o=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
=20
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=
re=20
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=
=20
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to=
=20
result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses=
=20
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position=
 or=20
results of operations.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=
=20
potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant=
=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=
=20
ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=
 and=20
sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=
=20
were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these=
=20
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=
=20
subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly=

located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November=

Dan O'Malley returned my call today. He was very cordial. He advised that 
there had been no response to your letter of November 22, 1999, since the 
project was not moving forward. According to O'Malley, "Bechtel could not get 
the machines."

As you might recall, I have been given the lead on the volumetric production
payment issue in the Wright case in general, and in dealing with EOG in
particular.

As you know, I have heard the long story from EOG.   You suggested that the
next time I was in Houston that we try to meet with Julia Heintz Murray to
get the more to point version from the ECT / Enron perspective.

I will be in town next week for the "measurement summit."  I could come
earlier, stay later, or carve out some time during to talk to Julia.  This
might be a good introduction for Andy as well.  (Of course, Barrett is also
included if his schedule permits.)

>From the viewpoint of my schedule, I would suggest Thursday afternoon,
Tuesday afternoon, or Friday morning, in approximate order of preference.
Let me know.

Janice:

After his trip to Singapore, Mike McConnell recently requested that Bob 
Williams (and possibly Mary Nell Browning) get up-to-speed on the First Gas 
contract issues to see if Bob can help in any way. As you may recall,  Bob 
(and Mary Nell) had assisted Mike on the J-Block contract litigation and 
settlement.

Bob has set up this call to get some background. Matt has prepared a note on 
the background, which I have forwarded to Bob. Matt has also prepared a 
package for Bob, which is supposed to arrive by courier in the next few days. 
I will forward Matt's note to you as well.

Thanks in advance for your participation in this matter.

Richard --

Just spoke with Sheila Tweed.  She said the company filled the slot for
which we presented George Bernhardt and suggested I contact you about
the company's attorney needs.

We have an attorney who did a clerkship at Marathon Oil (Houston) while
a University of Connecticut law student.  Since graduating in '94, he
has gained legal experience solely in Moscow doing energy work while at
international firms (including the London-based Denton Hall firm).  He
has a project finance background which made me think of your team at
Enron.

Are these credentials which interest you and the company?  Please give
me a ring or drop a line letting me know when you get a moment.  I
appreciate.

Best regards,

Gm.

We wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $250,000 and asked for $1 
million. It might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out. We 
would certainly take less than $1 million. What do you think?

I talked to Mark Palmer last week about some other issues and casually 
thanked him for talking to you. His response was somewhat disapointing: " I 
really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our Gov. affairs office, 
too bad they have no openings." Sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering 
on rude behavior. Take the transmission wire job, come repackage the deal to 
Enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from Enron.

John

I am in receipt of your letter concerning Mobil's election not to process its
gas through Bushton for the month of January, 2001.  Below is a copy of the
email received from Mobil concerning their gas election.   We are developing 
an
estimate of the processing costs for ECT.  Will forward under seperate cover.
In the future we will forward the Mobil notification when received.

Thank you for your patience.

Attached is a redline of the letter to Enerstar.  Both Peggy and I have made 
some changes.   When you have a chance let's talk.

1.  I'm not sure the address is correct anymore for Enerstar.

2.  I did not change it in the letter, but I have a question about the 
sentence in the last paragraph where we say that "... , Enron is not seeking 
to recover its considerable expenses from Enerstar Limited".  Do you think 
that we need to say this?

		 Subject: In re ICTS[MG Metals]


Richard,

Marcus told me that wanted to refer to you and me the above-referenced new MG 
Metals matter.  Briefly, ICTS of Athens, Alabama, one of MG Metals' shipping 
agents, has reportedly gone into bankruptcy, without paying about $80,000 
owed to various motor carriers (truckers) for transportation here in the U.S 
of MG Metal's aluminum.  No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone 
into bankruptcy.  

MG Metals' offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers' 
demand letters for these freight charges, some of which are from attorneys 
threatening suit.  These letters state that as consignee of the various 
cargoes, MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges.  I 
think that this is generally correct as a matter of U.S. law, given the usual 
motor carrier bills of lading, although I am having this double-checked.  

Since we have already paid most (but not all) of the money we owed to ICTS, 
MG Metals is looking at a double-payment exposure.  Also, even to the extent 
that ICTS has not been paid, it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended 
itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough to 
cover both ICTS's commission and the trucker's freight charges; in other 
words, a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than 
MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS (which amount should have covered 
both freight and commission).  

I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is $15,000.  
Bob Klide of MG's New York office and Nicole Dion of MG's Canada office (no 
relationship to Celine--I asked) will be shortly sending me their files.  

To complicate things a bit more, many of the letters Nicole has received deal 
with shipments made in March, at a time when Nicole and her office were 
employees of a trading division of Barclay's.  Some time afterward, they were 
acquired by MG Metals.  As a result of this, Barclay's may (depending on the 
agreement between Barclay's and MG Metals) be on the hook for some of this 
liability.  Nicole advises she has place a Barclay's representative on notice.

I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like.  
Obviously, it is a small dollar case and we don't want to pay any money to 
anyone unless we absolutely have to.  Let me know.

Britt

Power-company profits climb along with prices=20
=20
=20
 By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
October 18, 2000=20

A power company executive yesterday boiled California's ongoing electricity=
=20
crisis down to the bottom line.=20

"Prices are rising, and I know that's hurting consumers =01) but it certain=
ly=20
has been beneficial for Enron," said Jeffrey Skilling,=20
president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy and tradi=
ng=20
company.  Enron declined to specify how=20
much it earned from California during the past summer, when the state's=20
deregulated electricity market sent power prices=20
soaring. But the Texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic=
es=20
unit =01) which trades California electricity and o
ther commodities =01) increased 135 percent to $404 million.=20

Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, reported that income from its marketing=
=20
and trade unit soared more than 300 percent to $142 million.   Steve
Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, said California was perhaps only the=20
third-biggest contributor to that surge. But industry analysts said the=20
earnings
 reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks.=20

"California clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies,=
"=20
said Carol Coale, senior analyst of Prudential=20
Securities. "And you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong=
=20
reports (from the power industry)."  She and others=20
say they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the=
=20
state, where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases.=20

Companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from=
=20
the deregulated market. Enron produces no electricity in California=20
but is the nation's largest electricity trader, buying and selling the outp=
ut=20
of power plants owned by other companies.=20

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, said the big profits should be seen in=20
something other than a business context.  "These massive profits=20
by the energy companies translate directly into thousands of San Diegans=20
losing savings that were planned for education, mortgage=20
payments, health care and other . . . necessities," Hunter said.=20

When the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter =
of=20
hours, "it was clear that predatory pricing was producing=20
massive profits for someone," Hunter said.  Hunter insists that recent powe=
r=20
prices violate federal law mandating that rates be "just and reasonable."=
=20
He is calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds=
.=20
FERC is scheduled to issue a report on the California market by Nov. 1.=20

The political fallout from the price increases, meanwhile, appears to weigh=
=20
heavily on power companies, which are reluctant to tout successes in=20
California for fear of being singled out for profiteering.=20

After noting that Dynegy's recent acquisitions in Illinois contributed=20
strongly to the company's success last quarter, Bergstrom was reminded that=
=20
he=20
had omitted mention of California.=20

"Illinois is not as politically volatile as California," Bergstrom said.=20

He acknowledged that Dynegy did "pretty well" in California because its pow=
er=20
plants produced far more electricity this year than last. Bergstrom=20
also sought to correct an earlier report that Dynegy had quickly recouped t=
he=20
cost of power plants it recently acquired in the state.=20

He said that was true only of the plants it owns in Long Beach and El=20
Segundo, which it bought in 1998. Bergstrom said the cost of Dynegy's half=
=20
interest=20
in the former San Diego Gas & Electric Encina power plant in Carlsbad =01)=
=20
acquired at the end of 1998 =01) had not been recovered.=20

Typically, plant operators assume that it will take as long as 20 years to=
=20
recoup such costs.=20

In comments to financial analysts, Skilling, of Enron, suggested that power=
=20
companies could help provide a solution to California's power problems.=20

"Supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in California and oth=
er=20
locations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like Enron=20
to provide reliable power and stable prices," Skilling said.  He predicted=
=20
that California's utility companies =01) which now buy much of their power =
from=20
other companies =01) would sign long-term contracts to stabilize prices,=20
following an approach suggested by many power generators and traders.=20

"If they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to 10-year=20
contracts, then they could get contracts for $50 a megawatt, which is not=
=20
much=20
different than they were paying two or three years ago," Skilling said.=20

But consumer advocates have noted that long-term contracts at those levels=
=20
would lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little=20
choice about suppliers. Advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted=
=20
that introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs=20
and to greater consumer choice.=20

Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said he=
=20
was skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry.=20

"Any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged=
=20
in faking out the California public and price gouging when there=20
are shortages," said Snyder, who advocates an end to deregulation.=20

"They do not have consumer interests at heart."

Richard:  I must admit I feel like a real pain in the ___ since I know how 
much stuff you have going on, but I wanted to see if we could set up a call 
with you with some of our folks working on the Infineum lawsuit so that we 
are in a position to file responsive papers in the case shortly.  As we 
initially discussed, the factual situation relating to East Coast's history 
of dealings with Infineum (formerly Exxon) is incredibly complex as are the 
various contractual and other documents.  Jon Mostel, our principal 
transactions lawyer who has been working for more than a year with East Coast 
Power on the contract with Tosco (i.e., Bayway Refining Company), has been 
instrumental in providing the factual, legal and regulatory predicates for 
the East Coast deal and how Infineum fits into or is affected by that.  We 
have given significant thought over the past few weeks to the underlying 
issues in the case, the relevant precedent as well as the likely strategic 
moves at this point, taking into account the particular federal judge 
assigned to the case.  We would like to walk through our thought process with 
you to obtain your input on the case strategy at this point, particularly if 
Enron has a general policy or pre-disposition on the litigation side to go 
one way or the other from a procedural standpoint subject, of course, to the 
specific facts present in the case.  Could you let me know if there may be a 
convenient  time when you could speak with us.  You could call me or Steve 
Levitsky (212) 424-8309, one of my litigator colleagues here in New York who 
is assisting Stuart in preparing the case.  As I noted in my v-mails, Stuart 
recently has been involved in an ongoing trial in Federal Court in New Jersey 
and Steve has been taking the laboring oar on the necessary research and 
factual investigation and is fully familiar with the case.  Hopefully, we 
could do it before next Wednesday, but if it would be of any help I will be 
in your offices next Wednesday and with a little juggling I could probably 
visit you in your office sometime in the a.m. or afternoon and then plug our 
litigators in by phone.  Perhaps you could reply to this and let me know what 
might work for you.  Thanks.  I hope that you have a good holiday weekend.  
John

Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person
concerning a possible investment by Enron in some reorganized form of the
project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
so, who?

We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
first.

Steve, I have received notice of service in a lawsuit styled:  The People
of the State of California, etc. v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., et al.
(including Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc.)
that was filed in the California Supreme Court, County of San Francisco
(#318189).  I know that this is not in San Diego, but wanted to make sure
that it was not the lawsuit that you were tracking earlier.  It is a
complaint for unfair, unlawful and deceptive trade practices regarding the
deregulation of the California electric power industry.  Let me know if you
think it is the same.  thanks, Becky

Gail's participation has been very helpful to this effort.  Her presence in 
Bombay will help us with the likely "real time" India action to be taken in 
the next week or so.

Gentlemen -

We are currently in the processing of serving/delivering the GOM Guarantee 
demand and the PPA Meet and Discuss Letter.  Ken Lay approved the delivery in 
a conference call this morning.  Our attention will then turn to the GOI 
Guarantee demand (can be served a week from today), the Notice of Arbitration 
under the GOM Guarantee and anticipation of injunctive relief being sought by 
our counterparties to stay any arbitration and collection/payment on the 
guarantees.

We are scheduled to meet with the lenders in NY tomorrow.

Subject: Dabhol - An Update on Legal Efforts

Jim/Mark -

I know that Rob has been keeping you generally apprised, but I thought that I 
would update you both on the quickly evolving Dabhol situation.

The commercial situation at Dahbol Power Company is deteriorating pretty 
rapidly.  MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October 
invoice.  They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.  
Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.  The MSEB Chairman says 
that MSEB can't pay these invoices.

At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage 
in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 1400 MW 
that will come on line as part of Phase II.  They say that they recognize 
their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested 
in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).

Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even 
their own ongoing interest obligation.  At present, they are refusing to 
continue funding any other Phase II draw request.  The India banks have a 
great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing 
to fund Phase II.  It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive 
or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future -- perhaps there are 
other reasons for their current position.

We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.  Our main goal 
is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have 
the India banks do the same.

The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 1995 India 
legal crisis team.  The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and 
international) are continuing to play much the same roles.

We have not identified any particular "holes" in Dabhol's legal position.  
While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow 
MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.  
No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.

In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and 
(2) a "meet and discuss" letter under the PPA.  The current plan is to serve 
these next week.  We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the 
GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against 
MERC.  MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.  They have 
issued "orders" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB 
buys from Dabhol.  We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.  
We may or may not ultimately file this action.

Let me know if I can provide any further information.

Bruce

The employee in question in Bill's e-mail is Harry Moulton.  Harry is an 
employee of EECC's construction subsidiary, NEPCO.  Harry was in Korea to 
survey the machines at the Kunsan site.  Harry is currently the NEPCO site 
manager for the construction of a sixth unit at East Coast Power's Linded 
project (Enron owns 25%).  As far as the depositions go, it would certainly 
be better if Bob and I could do them back-to back, but that is a lawyer vs 
lawyer issue, let us know.

Steve this is a classic example why  we have to push and push for progress 
and results.
There is no explicable reason why it can have taken this company so long to 
come up with this conclusion/report.
The discrepancies are very large and not having seen our claim I cannot judge.
The only way you are going to make progress is to get a meeting organised  
immediately and as Ted says go over it point by point. A $900,000 claim 
reduced to $ 150,000 is a serious issue .
>From what I can gather from Ted Rosen's note is that  Baytank appear to admit 
to some form of liability/responsibility on the off spec which  I suppose is 
some progress.
I'm copying Graham on this now because he has plenty of experience in Europe 
with these claims .
This must be  sorted out and treated as high priority.
Call me to discuss
Thanks

Stuart

Subject: Re: Cargo/Storage Claim - Styrene at Baytank  

I guess that we all expected such a reply from the Insurance company.  
Apparently we need to have a meeting to discuss the letter that I just 
received because I am very curious where all these numbers and information 
have come from.

1) What does a contract with Enron and  Philchem have to do with a cargo 
claim?  The product in the tank was owned by Enron and only Enron.  

2) On November 5th we discovered that the product was off-spec.  The 
beginning inventory that day was approx. 6.6mm pounds.  Where does 2mm pounds 
come from?

3) Baytank would not admit to a problem with the tank in which Enron is bound 
by contract.  Enron, under contract, is still obligated to pay costs 
assoiated with the tank.  In order for the tank to be used, it must be 
cleaned since it is considered off-spec.  Enron had nothing to do with the 
tank going off-spec and should be compensated for any and all out of costs 
and expenses incurred while the tank was considered off-spec.  

4) The tank agreement stipulates that a minimum of 3,104 mtons will be paid 
every month for thru-put no matter how much volume goes thru the tank.  
Again, Enron is bound by a contract and is still responsible for these costs 
until Baytank is proven at fault.

Richard, further to our previous discussions on how we should address Enron 
Canada Corp. in the ENA tape retention policy, I have prepared the attached 
rider which could be inserted as a separate heading for Enron Canada into the 
schedule identifying who has authority to access and approve the listening to 
of tapes.  Subject to any comments you might have, I think it works and 
properly identifies the parties Rob Milnthorp wants to have such authority 
here.

I would think that Lavo is now the other person besides yourself that needs 
to approve this.

Cheers.

Greg

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the 
issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Gentlemen - two items.

First, HPL has been sued (filed but not served) in a very minor right-of-way 
matter.  It is so minor I expect it can be resolved before plaintiff ever 
serves.  What type of information/involvement, if any,  would you like to see 
on this matter?

Second, the big picture.  Since Mr. Hammer has moved on to better hunting and 
fishing grounds, I now have overall responsibility of the GPG Law Operations 
group.  What types of information/involvement would you like to see on any 
HPL litigation that would be handled by operations?  We will, of course, keep 
Mr. Schneider well informed since he is the client.  

Thoughts??

Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for
Enron's motion to compel.  As you may recall, they say they want a
deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

Thanks.

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)

Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 
84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how 
hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to 
him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any 
offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very 
seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press 
on.

hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?

2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to

I will copy the writ to each of you immediately.

Mr. Sanders, as you now have the privilege of handling our litigation, I am 
looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point 
of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the 
courtroom work?

FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis 
Delewski against CIGSA, did a fine job, and knows the players, and I would be 
glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do. 

Randy Pais will work it from within EEOS legal. 

I have not yet notified Jim Derrick, thinking that either you or Mark might 
want to. I am quite happy to call him if you like.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

All three arbitrators are okay with the week of August 20th.  How does it 
look at your end? Also, do we want a "reasoned opinion" or just a "decision" 
from them?  Since there are few, if any grounds for an appeal, McDade 
recommends a "decision". Ileana
>>> <Bonnie.White@enron.com> 02/13/01 11:07AM >>>
Ileana,

As of now, my calendar is clear for August 20th.  I will pencil this in,
although I think we should make sure that everybody also has the 21st open
in case the arbitration takes more than one day.  We will, of course, need
to have Max Yzaguirre available.  Even though we are posturing the case as
a summary judgment case, I think it would also be helpful to have Dwight
Beach and Steve Irwin available.  They would be the two best witnesses, I
think, to discuss all of the things that McKenna had not done in order to
have a viable project.  I believe this type of testimony would be helpful
to the arbitrators so that they would know that, in ruling on the contract
interpretation as a matter of law, they are also ruling in a fundamentally
fair manner--neither the law nor equity is on McKenna's side.  If you
agree, I will contact them about their availability.  I agree that we
should despose McKenna fairly quickly.  We will need to nail down what he
might say as to contacts with offtakers, etc., so that we can determine the
necessity of getting them involved.  If we do need to get them involved,
perhaps we could do so by way of affidavit rather than live testimony, or,
at most, by deposition.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
possibility is out there.

Tom, I don't know if Carl has had a chance to let  you know that Brazos would

Richard--

We have agreed to depose Ron Natole on Feb. 18 at 10 a.m., at his lawyer's 
office.  I will copy you on the amended notice we are sending out today.

We have not rescinded our depo notices for the 2 Korean gentlemen, but have 
agreed to reset the dates.  I expect Plaintiff's counsel will de-designate 
these men rather than bring them here for their depos.  The only other notice 
we sent out last week was for the designated expert from the Wood Group -- 
Robert Harrison.  I will attempt to obtain available dates directly from him.

With respect to the depos of Enron personnel, please check with Mike Miller 
and Bob Virgo regarding their availability during the 2 weeks we discussed -- 
Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 -- March 3.  Of course, we will also need a block of time 
in advance of the depos to prepare with the witnesses.  Bill has a trial 
setting the 2nd week (Feb. 28), which may be postponed in the near future.  
If it is not, I can present them for their depos.  Plaintiff's counsel has 
not mentioned any other Enron personnel by name, but has generally requested 
dates for anyone else we may be presenting at trial as a fact witness or 
corporate rep.

The only other name that I recall having potentially significant involvement 
was Dave Marshall, an ECT risk management guy who appears to have had some 
discussions with IBC's Ron Anderson about Enron's requirements with respect 
to repaired/refurbished parts.  Bill believes there may be other Enron 
witnesses, and that Miller and Virgo will know who they are.

We are also working up a list of proposed mediators -- preferably with strong 
commercial litigation experience.  Gary McGowan currently heads the list, but 
I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have.

Lastly, I agree with your suggestion regarding our question as to why the 
Wood Group (Robert Harrision) has appeared on Plaintiff's expert list.  It 
would certainly be helpful to have Miller's thoughts on that subject.

The following two invoices don't have work orders setup:

1.  Bracewell & Patterson Re:  Berry Group, Ltd. and Berry Contracting, LP v. 
Enron North America Corp.
 Amount:  $6,900.00

2.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges Re:  ENA/Perry Gas

                   $352.50  (Invoice #10013082B)

Should these be coded to General Litigation or do you want me to set up new 
work orders?  If so, who should they be allocated to (Team Leader)?

Subject: havmann - lpg claim with underwriters


john,

sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co 
which you passed to me some time ago.

basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in 
lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a 
sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides 
could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during 
the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this 
position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's 
case. 

the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an 
unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of 
loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships 
reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other 
reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as:

a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,
b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,
c) the use of unclean inert gas, and
d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper 
cleaning procedures.

i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's 
technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned 
ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the 
gastech 1988 paper.

it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper 
issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check 
their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears 
the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers 
into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on 
spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was 
loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.

in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, 
especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim 
stands and again apologize for the delayed reply.

regards

As discussed, I received a call this morning from Bill Redmond (440/893-0338) 
who indicated that he is currently representing John Schultes (former CEO of 
NSM) in connection with certain litigation.  He explained that he was trying 
to coordinate depositions from Enron related to this investment.  

His view of appropriate Enron team members included:  David Leboe, Brian 
Vass, Brian Barth and Kevin McConville.

He mentioned the existence of a certain memorandum regarding a visit to 
Thailand that Vass and myself performed during late 1998 to address 
accounting and reporting concerns.  I did not comment on the existence of the 
memo.

Please find this memo included as an attachment.  Vass and I performed this 
review at the request of the Origination unit (McConville and Barth) and my 
former boss (Drew Lynch).  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards.

Richard,

I am forwarding an e-mail that I received today from Durango Petroleum re the 
Collins matter in Hardin County.  I spoke with the company president today.  
He believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the 
matter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to 
defend it.  I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to 
pay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.  I am 
concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a 
year ago to remove the pipe/valve.  I asked him if he had any correspondence 
or other evidence of that .  He will check and get back to us.  Lisa 
Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its 
file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.  
If we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to 
a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove 
intentional trespass.  However, I still believe that Collins will have a 
difficult time proving any actual damages.  We need to be cautious about not 
getting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping 
Collins to prove his case.  

Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two 
weeks.  We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 
17.  Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.  He 
sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for 
production along with the notice of trial setting.  Lisa Robichaux will work 
with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.  We also intend 
to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return 
(July24).  In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for 
continuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of 
his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.  
However, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not 
granted.  I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Bonnie

Hi,

We can not agree to the modifications. However, we can agree to exclusive
jurisdiction in New York.  Pls. let me know if that will work for you.
Leaving jurisdiction and venue open is not an option.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

 Mark,

I received a call from Pryor Counts Inc. regarding a valuation of HEOF.  I
gave them some vague responses, but wanted to confirm that these inquiries
are legitimate and I can fully answer any of their questions.

Thanks

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

As many of you probably know by now, our chargeback case is scheduled for 
next week's FERC agenda.  Thus, if its not too late already, it is imperative 
that we file our answer to the PX's answer ASAP.  In this regard, no party 
filed a reply yesterday in opposition to the PX's motion to the bankruptcy 
court to lift the automatic stay.  It is my understanding that a proposed 
order is circulating among applicable bankruptcy counsel.  If all counsel 
sign today, the PX intends to file it with the court tomorrow and we could 
conceivably get an order from the court tomorrow modifying the stay.

I am advised, however, that if not all counsel are available to sign the 
proposed order today, the PX intends to simply file the proposed order with 
the court tomorrow.  In this event, under local rules, the court must wait 
seven days before entering an order modifying the stay.  Of course, this will 
be after FERC's meeting next week.

Assuming that an order is not issued tomorrow, the question for the group is 
whether we should file our answer tomorrow in any event.  The theory would be 
that since the debtor itself sought to modify the stay so as to permit 
litigation of the chargeback proceeding to continue, no party opposed the 
motion, and the debtor filed a proposed order with the court to modify the 
stay, any violation of the automatic stay would be technical at best, and 
unlikely to be raised by the PX in the bankruptcy proceeding.  (This argument 
would be enhanced if the PX requests the court, when it eventually enters its 
order, to do so retroactively to April 6).

I would like to hear from the parties (including bankruptcy counsel) whether 
they endorse or oppose this approach.  Thanks.  Ron

P.S.  if you are aware of any members of our group that have been left off 
this email, please let me know.

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida 
law. Have you looked at Fla. law?

With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point. Please 
look at the limitations issue in light of what you know. An extensive review 
of the depositions doesn't seem warranted to me. I would also suggest we 
enter into a Tolling Agreement w/ Power systems ASAP. Call me to 
discuss--853-5587

Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.

My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
Enron may have are protected.

Thanks.

Richard,

You and I have spoken about the costs in this case previously.  Matt and I 
have asked our various attorneys/experts to bill us monthly from this point 
forward, in order to get a better handle on those costs.

Matt has offered to be the "billing contact" for all our attorneys/experts.  
I am also available to do the same thing, although I obviously would have to 
charge my time for it.  I do think that a central billing contact is a good 
idea.

Please let Matt and me know how you want to proceed with this.

I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first 
time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain 
check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am 
here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am 
in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am 
and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy 
in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about 
lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

josepgr@ffhsj.com


Norm Kleinberg
Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP
One Battery Park Plaza
NY  10004
212-837-6680
kleinber@hugheshubbard.com


In addition, VE has a lateral partner whom I have not met:

James Serota

Jamie's bio says that his area of practice is antitrust and business
litigation,particularly concentrated on industries
that are evolving fromregulation to competition, including electric
utilities.  It says he chaired the Fuel and Energy Industry Committee of the
ABA Antitrust Section from 94-97.

When are you in town, so we can have dinner?

Ron

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

Richard, did you ever have a chance to pull the July, Aug. phone tapes for

 Do you have lunch plans today? If not, do you want to meet at the new Post

Kirsten,

As I mentioned to you this morning by phone, we are advised that Brazos 
Electric
Power Cooperative filed a cert. petition on Friday with respect to the  Fifth
Circuit decision in the QF case.  We will send the papers to you (or to 
whomever
Enron or Ponderosa designates) when they come in.

I believe that someone in our D.C. office has informed the Solicitor General's
office that we no longer represent the partnership.  However, I don't think it
will not be necessary for us to file a withdrawal as counsel for the 
partnership
since the cert petition starts a new proceeding.

Regards,

Bart

I think Richard Sanders is managing this litigation.  The other party is

you don't want to give Richard any reason to transfer it to you (or to me).

John - I knew that this was tickling my memory and suddenly I remembered!  
Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of 
liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same 
entity to which you refer).  

By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened 
to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how 
can we get copies of the liquidation evidence.

Hi, Kate. It surely can wait that long. 

By the wasy, we have another company that somehow has been allocated to us, 
Enron Gas Liquids, a French Company, that EECC was surprised to find it owns 
and has no use for, so we would like to liquidate it as well. Is that 
something your gang would handle as well, just to make sure that no other 
Enron entity needs it?

How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from 
leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at 
the school schedule for the first time in several  weeks. Now mind you she 
had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a

funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?.

Subject: Furlow Services, Inc. v. Ecogas Corp.



Britt and Bonnie:

As I discussed with Britt this morning, I represent Furlow Services, Inc., 
which is owed substantial sums under two general construction contracts with 
Ecogas Corp., one in Dallas (the McCommas Landfill) and the other in San 
Antonio (Nelson Gardens Landfill).  (There are two "Ecogas Corp."s, one a 
Texas corp. and one a Delaware corp. It appears that Furlow's contracts are 
with the Delaware corporation, but I have not been able to fully verify that.)

Tom Hall, the general cousel of Ecogas (512/347-1441), tells us, in general 
terms, that Ecogas has been acquired by Enron (ECT, I think) and that we will 
get paid when Enron puts up the money.  Mr. Hall has mentioned that his 
contact at Enron is John Lambert.  I called Mr. Lambert yesterday, but have 
not yet received a response. Mr. Hall also disputes our invoices, although we 
have not been able to get him to set out his disputes in any detail.

I have been corresponding with Mr. Hall, trying to get this worked out, since 
August of this year, and we are now at an impasse.  Furlow Services has filed 
mechanic's liens and desires to file suit.  I have prepared lawsuits for 
recovery of the Furlow accounts on the two projects and to foreclose its 
liens on those projects.

There are two reasons why I am contacting you before filing the lawsuits:

     1.  I need to verify what (if any) relationship there is between Ecogas 
and Enron.  Since I have represented other Enron subsidiaries, and would like 
to continue to do so, I will not file any lawsuit against Enron or any of its 
subsidiaries.  If we confirm that Ecogas really is an Enron subsidiary, 
whether direct or indirect, then I will obtain new counsel for Furlow 
Services on this dispute.

     2.  Since Enron regularly pays its bills, something doesn't seem right 
about this entire scenario if Enron has in fact acquired Ecogas.  If Enron 
does have responsibility for Ecogas' construction costs, perhaps this all can 
be worked out in a meeting rather than a lawsuit.  If I can facilitate 
working this out, and if both Furlow and Enron consent to my continuing to 
play a role in settlement discussions, I would continue to represent Furlow 
solely for purposes of settlement discussions.

     I sincerely appreciate your help on this matter.  I know it is hard to 
get anything done this week, and I will be leaving this afternoon for the 
Thanksgiving holiday.  No lawsuits will be filed this week, and I will follow 
up with you next week before taking any action.  In the meantime, thanks 
again and have a great holiday!

Subject: Litigation report

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on 
behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we 
summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases 
as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside 
counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will 
need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have 
been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. 
Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have 
been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile ("Codelco" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG 
and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state 
copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but 
also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts 
on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the 
main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim 
from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, 
which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has 
NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document 
and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made 
subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 
5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, 
High Court proceedings take place in public.

2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client 
contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 
2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. 
Solicitors: Clyde & Co.


3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses 
believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as 
preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar 
inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with 
Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally 
(and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent 
offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to 
unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  
LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being 
established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and 
have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent 
basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by 
Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume 
possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting 
advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become 
sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known 
to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME 
warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves 
significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in 
arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH 
(and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed 
the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in 
November to the "ENA Legal Department" that he suspected had been laying 
around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with 
Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They 
threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned 
this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have 
slipped his mind.  Can you help me?
Thanks.

Britt

I will copy the writ to each of you immediately.

Mr. Sanders, as you now have the privilege of handling our litigation, I am 
looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point 
of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the 
courtroom work?

FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis 
Delewski against CIGSA, did a fine job, and knows the players, and I would be 
glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do. 

Randy Pais will work it from within EEOS legal. 

I have not yet notified Jim Derrick, thinking that either you or Mark might 
want to. I am quite happy to call him if you like.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the 
issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial 
lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money 
becuase Schwab began charging a $15 per quater account fee. Does anyone have 
any suggestions about where to put it--other than in Doug Hester's college 
tuition. The account is up to(down to) $8500.

there has been an HSE incident at Redcar in relation to a stockpile of Enron 
coal. We are still awaiting details and I will report as and when more 
information is available. I have discussed this with Michael, and it seems 
that almost certainly we will need to involve outside counsel. The firm that 
springs to mind having both coal and litigation experience is Linklaters. If 
anyone has any thoughts on this perhaps they wd let me know. tks

I agree with your comments that we cannot get out of our resposibilities and 
as such were obliged to provide the information.  Not to do so could have 
looked suspicious especially  when it is highly unlikely that their will be 
anything in the analysis document to show our coal to be more problematic 
than anyone else's.  As I said this morning, all fumes from coal fires are 
toxic and prolonged exposure will cause headaches, sickness etc..  This is 
not a function of the coal quality but of the combustion of the coal causing 
toxic gases. Consequently Mark Patten is concerned that Corus are not open to 
criticism for inadequate safety procedures and is trying to protect their own 
position.  Certainly the heating in the stockpile is to an extent due to the 
delay in moving the pile.

George, tks for this. I understand from Scott that the certificate was sent 
anyway this morning. The delivery terms under the confirm provide for site 
delivery so that the coal belongs to Enron. To that extent we cannot evade 
our responsibility. However, if the problems with the stockpile have arisen 
as a result of Mission not taking the coal, then we have an argument to say 
that the issue has been caused by EME not Enron. Let's find out more, and we 
may need to put Mission on notice. tks

Mark Patten has just phoned me back regarding the hot coal.

One of their shovel drivers apparently felt ill on Friday and it is believed
it was due to fumes being emitted from the pile. He needs a copy of the Cape
Oceania coal quality analysis for health and safety reasons. Could you
please send one up to him. I explained to him that coal contains just about
every element you can think of and the fumes from the pile are toxic, as
from any coal fire, but he feels he needs the information to protect
himself.

I just got back from vacation and  read your e-mail regarding this 
bankruptcy.  Keeping that in mind, no bells are ringing about this 
bankruptcy.  If a POC was filed, it was done by Bonnie.  She handles most 
everything (inhouse) for us.  Please check her files.  I assume that Britt is 
stepping in for her while she's on vacation????  Let me know if you find a 
POC (if none was filed, then the ballot issue appears to be moot).

Linda,
 Bonnie White asked me to work with you on gathering information about this 
bankruptcy.  The following sets forth the deadline schedule that I obtained 
from Pacer regarding this matter:

 1)  6/12/00   - Voting Record Date to determine which creditors or entitled 
to vote to 
       accept or reject the Plan
 2)  7/21/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Objections due to Confirmation of the Plan
 3)  7/21/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Deadline for ballots to accept or reject the Plan

 4)  7/27/00 @ 9:30 am  - Confirmation hearing on the Plan
 5)  7/31/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Objections due to assignment by Adair Supply
 6)  8/14/00 @ 11:30 am  - Hearing re objections to claims of Enogex Expl.


I obtained from PACER a copy of the Claims Register Report and it lists ECT 
as having filed a claim on 3/23/00--but it does not reflect how much is the 
total claim.  Also, included in Debtor's 2d Amended Jt Disclosure Statement, 
it reflects that  Class 4 Creditors consists of all Allowed Unsecured Claims 
including ECT's claim arising from the termination of an Option (Corridor) 
dated 5/28/99 between MPC and Enron and the Confirmation of an Option 
(Collar) dated 11/6/98 between MPC and Enron (the "Enron Swaps").

I would appreciate your help with answering the following questions:

1)  Was a Proof of Claim filed on behalf of ECT and for how much?
2)  Who is the person who will handle filing out and signing the Ballot on 
behalf of ECT either rejecting or accepting the Plan
 [which is due to be filed on or before 7/21/00].
3)  If we are not owed any monies by Michael Petroleum, or have not asserted 
a claim against Michael Petroleum, then we
 can disregard sending in the ballot on behalf of ECT.     

I have copies of all these documents, so if you need me to send you anything, 
please let me know.  I appreciate your help with this and please call me if 
any of this information is confusing.  Brenda x3-6536

I believe I had sent to you a reply earlier this month to your memo to me 
regarding how to allocate the outstanding inovice to cost centers (e.g., mine 
or Richard's). In my reply, I indicated that I thought that since all of the 
work done by Watson Farley in the attached invoice was in anticipation of an 
arbitration, the bill should be paid from the litigation RC. If you would 
like to discuss, please let me know.

Please confirm that the invoice has been or will be paid soon. Thanks for

Would appreciate if you could help with the processing of WFW's bill. The 
bill is not small, but not unexpected. I've spent quite a lot of time 
reviewing it with Neale and already expended quite a bit of goodwill between 
us to get the bill reduced. We shouldn't delay payment further.

Thanks for your help.

I have sat with Neale Gregson to review WFW's bill and confirmed that it does 
not include independent FGH work. Although I have found the bill in order, I 
negotiated for WFW to reduce the bill by S$5,000 based on Enron Singapore's 
goodwill with WFW.

Matt,

This will follow up on my recent e-mail regarding the substantial initial 
bill from WFW.  Given my statement to Richard that I thought a substantial 
portion of that bill related to resolving the FGH issue, Richard has asked me 
to review and apportion that  bill between his R/C and Alan's R/C.  Subject 
to Richard and Alan's thoughts, however, I wonder if it makes more sense to 
ask Neale Gregson to do that for us, given that he was the one that spent the 
time.

I await your response.

I shall be forwarding WFW's bill (which includes PacMarine's bill) to Houston 
(for Joya Davis' attention) for payment of a reduced sum (SGD112,000 for 
WFW's legal fees). A credit note will be issued to us upon payment.

Britt - I don't have any comments on Clyde & Co's bill. If you are OK with 
it, I'll similarly forward thier bill to Joya to process payment. Please let 
me know.

Thanks and regards

I met with Neale Gregson this afternoon to discuss WFW's bill. We went 
through the bill item by item and I am satisfied that it is fair given the 
amount of work actually done. It is nevertheless  a hefty bill, so I did ask 
Neale for some accomodation. He has agreed to reduce the charges from 
SGD120,000 to SGD112,000. I should be xpecting a credit note from WFW. I 
trust this is acceptable to you as well. Please let me know.

Regards
Matt

regarding withholding of payments to creditors of monies the ISO has
received from PG&E.  We are interested in whether any of your clients have
received this communication, are interested in this issue and, if so,
whether you have any thoughts about how to proceed.

You are invited to participate in a conference call to discuss this issue on

ISO Market Participants:

On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market
settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a
total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding
November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as
shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the
December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the
preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative
November pay-out was 24.22%.

Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action
in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v.
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central
District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an
order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred
to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's
Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a
segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that
court.

Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements
and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6.

The following table provides an overview of the cash settlement:

Illinova remain in default for GMC obligation.

The distributions were made in accordance with the following tariff
provision:

 11.16.1 Pro Rata Reduction of Payments.
 If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a Payment
Date because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO Reserve
Account or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other credit
support provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shall
reduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amounts
payable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary to
clear the ISO Clearing Account.  The ISO shall account for such reduction in
the ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISO
Debtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.

As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations to
the ISO.  The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.  As a
result of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISO
reduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59
to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.  This action was consistent with
Settlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.  Additionally, for those
parties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were to
receive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflect
their GMC default.

 SABP 6.3.1.3
 The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISO
Clearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient funds
to pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day in
priority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days out
of the ISO Clearing Account.

Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party's
oldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4:

 SABP 6.10.4
 The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing to
ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation of
such debts.

Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/2001, were distributed to November 2000
and December 2000 creditors.  Payments received from parties who defaulted
in November were first applied to their November balances.  The $352,693.64
was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.

In accordance with Section 11.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISO
will assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate
(currently 10.5%:  prime plus 2%).

Certifications are required by Section 11.20.2 of the tariff.  Accordingly,
the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors.

 11.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount.
 The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by an
ISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts are
owed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary and
Final Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which the
ISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISO
Creditors.  An ISO certificate given under this Section 11.20.2 may be used
as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditors
in any legal proceeding.

The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.

We are still in litigation with them. We are the plaintiff but we are not 
interested in pursuing it. The outside atty is Phil Bruns 650-8805.

Travis,

 I reviewed an "Agreement for Project Services" having an effective
date of May 20, 1999 and a "Project Work Description" (PWD) with a date in
the title of May 27, 1999, which includes an Attachment A.  The PWD and its
Attachment A apparently modify the 5/20/99 agreement, but reference it as
the 5/21/99 agreement in the preamble and above the signature line.  The
5/20/99 agreement conveys (in paragraphs 4.8.1 and 4.8.2) any intellectual
property rights that Agency.com may have acquired to Enron Corp.  Attachment
A, however, added a paragraph 4.10 that begins with the following sentence:
"Company shall obtain no intellectual property rights to the Work unless it
has made timely payments of all reasonable and undisputed fees."

 Please confirm that "reasonable and undisputed fees" were paid and
that there is no 5/21/99 agreement.

 Thanks.

Have/are you implementing a document which the head trader and legal counsel

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders.

Richard, we have several form contracts being developed and used in EBS that 
include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting 
agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with 
any questions or comments.

Administrator v. ECT

This is the new matter that we received a notice of default judgment in the 
amount of $23,579.17 against ECT on Friday, 10/06.  I spoke this morning with 
David Reed, an associate with Harter, Secrest & Emery LLP in Rochestor, New 
York, who is counsel for the Plan Administrator.  He said that he will speak 
with the partner in charge of this matter re whether they will voluntarily 
agree to lift default judgment, but he expects that they will so that neither 
side has to go through a hearing.  He will let me know sometime this week.  
This is apparently a bankruptcy preference action.  He said that he will send 
to me today copies of the complaint, as well as any proof of service 
documentation.  I will forward it to you when I get it.  We can then get 
accounting documentation to determine whether we have valid defenses to the 
preference action.  Let me know if you'd like me to handle this, or if you 
want it handled in some other manner.  I don't anticipate that this will 
require a lot of time to evaluate and answer.  Thanks.

		 Subject: Settlement


Natwest, McDonald, and PaineWebber have collectively offered the
Farallon/Oaktree plaintiffs (and maybe Legg Mason, I am not sure) $13 million
to settle.  It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron to
contribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that they
would fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.  Hennegan is asking
for something in the "high $20s"  I am advised that the settlement group is
prepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.

I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,
except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as one
might expect.

If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron to
contribute.

attached.  The cover letter indicates that the Attorney General agrees to
abide by the confidentiality provisions outlined in an October 25, 2000
letter from the Attorney General which is also attached.  The CA ISO will
mark as confidential documents it produces to the Attorney General that
contain information subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential
treatment in accordance with the AG's October 25 letter. Concerns related to
the subpoena should be relayed directly to the Attorney General. The AG
contact related to the subpoena is Richard Rochman who can be reached at
(415) 703-1404.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any
concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol, at jsole@caiso.com

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

Gary,

The agreements we spoke of yesterday are being fedexed to you today.  After a 
more comprehensive look, it turns out that only the first few agreements had 
the unfortunate wording.  As the form of the agreement evolved with 
subsequent reviews and drafting, the problem disappeared.  At Richard 
Sanders' suggestion we interviewed the trader involved, and he was able to 
confirm that actual practices did not support the negative implications of 
some of the language.  Please call Steve and me with your comments after you 
have had a chance to review these documents.

Although I normally do not seek out conference calls, I think it would be
helpful for the four of us to get together by phone for 15 to 30 minutes for
a general update on the Grynberg and Quinque cases and to preliminarily
consider some of the tactical choices with which we may be confronted in the
near future, depending on how Judge Downes, Judge Murguia, and the MDL Panel
rule.

Would 4:30 or 5:00 p.m. Houston time on Monday or Tuesday work for you?

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting 
convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the 
litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

Richard,
 I have been working with Jeff Richter to solve some of the issues
concerning the bid data and questions that have arisen about the outcome
information we have already turned over to the experts.  Based upon a
conversation that I had with Jeff this morning, I believe it makes sense for
me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems.  I
want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it
will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the
information at his fingertips.  I am also scheduled to meet with the
Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading
practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland.  I also plan
to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information
he might have about my understanding of the trading practices.  If you need
more details, please let me know.

 Hope you had a pleasant 3 day weekend.

Thanks
Gary

and informed me that the $2.2 million HEOF committed to Cynet was in
escrow as of September 9, and not actually invested in cynet itself as
the escrow was pending the rescission financing.  The actual financing
closed in December of 1999.  It turned out that HEOF THEN (not before)
invested not only the $2.2 million that was in escrow as of the valuation
date but an additional $220,000.

I think the valuation implications are obvious.

I took the liberty of handling this directly with Greg; if you have any
other questions, please feel free to call him.

This just leaves Creole Shack (Roland Curry) who has never gotten back to

Subject: Grynberg - March 17 hearing


In the past couple of days, I have been deluged with
last-minute requests to videoconference into the March 17
hearing on the motions to dismiss.  We are well past the
deadlines Sprint asked us to comply with (February 25 for
private sites and March 1 for public sites).  At this stage,
adding new sites to such a large, nationwide
videoconference is extraordinarily burdensome, requiring
Sprint to move the entire conference to a different bridging
system, change the dial-in numbers, etc.  Also of importance
is the fact that the bridging system has space limitations.

Please e-mail me with all videoconference requests no later
than 12 p.m. Mountain tomorrow (Friday, March 10).  After the
noon cutoff, we will no longer be able to entertain additional
videoconference requests.  In the meantime, I will do my
best to accommodate the late requests we've received.

I will be sending out a detailed memo tomorrow afternoon
that lists all the sites that have been booked, along with
those who've made reservations.  Each of you planning to
videoconference will need to check carefully to be sure your
reservation is reflected in my memo.  In addition, many of
the sites have extremely limited seating, so please do not
plan to show up at a public site without a reservation.

Thanks to all of you for your consideration.

it.  Can you send it to Lucy Marshall and to me, so that we can work with Jim 
to try to get this out today or tomorrow.  I believe we need to move forward

Subject: 



I have just learned of another lawsuit involving CGAS.  This had been
handled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is why
neither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.

This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.  The style is
Kilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.  In the Court of
Common Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio  Case No. CH96-0311.

CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.  Eastland Energy had a lease on an
adjoining tract.  Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill a
well on a unit formed by the two leases.  CGAS agreed.  Eastland was
designated operator.  Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.
Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.  Eastland thought Kilbarger
negligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half the
drilling cost.  Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit against
Eastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)
and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.  Kilbarger was not
seeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless since
CGAS has since released its lease.  Thus, we have no pending claims from
Kilbarger.

However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.  During
the drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work for
Eastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.  Those
contractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGAS
paid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.  Eastland did not
pay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for
$7,139.69.  No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.

I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.
There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case is
set for trial on December 16.  I am hopeful this will be resolved before
trial.  If there are questions, please call.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Additional Writs of Garnishments served on 
EEPC and EPCC

We were just served with two additional writs of garnishment in the same 
case, naming Enron Power Construction Company and Enron  Equipment 
Procurement Company. 

The advice below applies in full with respect to these entities.

In response to questions I have received,  "CIGSA" refers to "Contrucciones 
Industriales Del Golfo SA de CV",  "CIGSA Contrucciones Industriales Del 
Golfo SA de CV" and their affiliates.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

Morris has re-set the hearing for August 22-24.  Final briefs are due August
15.  Up to the parties to negotiate revised discovery deadlines.

I assume witness designations and summaries are still due this Saturday,
meaning Monday.

Please let Brian Redmond (and anyone else who needs to know) know about the
change.  In particular, please advise our witnesses (unless you want me to
call them directly).

Please send me Andy's email address, as I do not have it.

Please keep us posted as to the developments on the business side re
commercial solution.

CFP and I discussed my question, posed
to both you and her, about whether I
needed to involve others at my firm in this
case.  Her view was no, and I do not
disagree.  But I did not hear from you
and, still scarred from my prior error in
assuming that CFP spoke for Enron, I
would like to have your view.  So, again: do you want Geoff Harrison, Vineet 
Bhatia
or Steve Susman involved in this case? Right now it is being handled by a
Bracewell team, a V&E team, and me as
the sole SG contributor.  That's fine with
me if it is with you and JVD.

Subject: NSM Suits in CA



I spoke with Legg Madson's lawyer today.  He said that his complaint was
done in haste and that he had not really thought everything through yet.  He
said he would be glad to consider any written or oral showing we may wish to
offer as to why ECT should not be in the suit.  (I made a brief pitch about
why would we invest $30m just to get $750K as a fee for defrauding
ourselves.  The lawyer seemed to understand.)  Richard, we should now decide
how to proceed.  I would suggest a phone call with Legg Mason's counsel that
you participate in, going over the facts and offering to supply documents to
support what we say.

Lisa, could you fax me a copy of the signed agreement with Oaktree in which
ECT/Enron agreed to some continuing cooperation with Oaktree in the
litigation.  Mike Swartz is calling us about that

I have reviewed a copy of the notice and summons which were served on ENA by 
Blue Grass Synfuels, et al.  I notice that there was no complaint served with 
the summons.  I assume you will be engaging counsel in New York to represent 
ENA in this matter.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to assist.  
Also, if the complaint is ultimately served on our outside counsel (rather 
than through ordinary service of process) after ENA serves its Notice of 
Appearance, please make sure to send Corporate Risk Management (Jim Studdert) 
a copy of the Complaint, so that it can be reviewed for possible coverage.  I 
know the matter sounds like breach of contract, but it's worth having the 
insurance review done if any quasi-tort claims are made.

Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

In case you have not seen this case, it talks about class certification of
unfair competition claims in California -- even allows a national class
based upon California Law.

Kirsten,

As I mentioned to you this morning by phone, we are advised that Brazos 
Electric
Power Cooperative filed a cert. petition on Friday with respect to the  Fifth
Circuit decision in the QF case.  We will send the papers to you (or to 
whomever
Enron or Ponderosa designates) when they come in.

I believe that someone in our D.C. office has informed the Solicitor General's
office that we no longer represent the partnership.  However, I don't think it
will not be necessary for us to file a withdrawal as counsel for the 
partnership
since the cert petition starts a new proceeding.

Regards,

Bart

I didn't talk to them expressly but Rob told me at my review that Jim wanted 
him to tell me that I was "on the line" for the International litigation 
until you and Mark told him that I was "relieved of duty."   So I have sort 
of reverted back to feeling primarily responsible for it since I know you are 
leading the charge in California.    But whenever you and Mark are ready to 
relieve me I'm ready to be relieved.

Subject: Cuiaba Call--legal issues

1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) 
reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's 
letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to 
sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There 
are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows 
whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it 
is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask 
our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  
Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, 
Electronorte. 

2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the 
ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, 
Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political 
avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, 
however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek 
assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political 
battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to 
seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to 
progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has 
expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong 
message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we 
proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 
of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at 
the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little 
time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate 
proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what 
reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure 
how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the 
commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure 
what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may 
affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look 
at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or 
express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would 
advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with 
respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand 
every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix 
developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own 
way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have 
traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who 
represents them. 

3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE 
does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the 
contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm 
told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that 
we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine 
Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our 
force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our 
position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both 
parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  
I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.

4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration 
concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what 
it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. 
Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to 
consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of 
proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a 
number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It 
needs to be subject to review as we go along.

5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going 
to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and 
get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best 
advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the 
Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so 
I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in 
the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position 
that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.
Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. 
John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I 
may be unaware of with any strategic plan.
Regards,
Michelle

		 Subject: Proposed Agenda

Attached is a preliminary agenda for the LeBoeuf meetings this week.  

I would like to propose that we have the LeBoeuf lawyers in the office midday 
Tuesday to meet with us Tuesday afternoon and then as much as Wednesday as 
necessary. I would assume we would want a core group of lawyers to attend all 
or substantially all of the meetings and then we would bring in business 
people as appropriate. I would also try to arrange the schedule to handle EES 
only or EWG only issues  in blocks.

1.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW  ASAP IF THIS SCHEDULE IS A PROBLEM. I know getting on 
everyone's calendar on short notice is a challenge.  Thanks in advance for 
your attention to this matter. 
2.  John, can you highlight for me any areas where you expect business 
participation so we can start arranging our business people's schedules.
3.  EWG - who will take the lead on discussing the commercial agreements?
4.  Let me know if you have additional agenda topics. 
5.  Jim, should we arrange some time on your calendar with the LeBoeuf 
lawyers?

Please get me any suggestions, etc. Monday morning and we will work toward  
developing the final agenda for the meeting.

Subject: Proposed Agenda


Vicki:

Attached is a draft of a proposed agenda for your consideration.  It has more 
things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be 
a little more inclusive in the "bullets" to make sure we cover as much as 
possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all 
of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we 
have everyone together at this kick off meeting.  I would view the primary 
purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and 
to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations 
that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context.

I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some 
additional comments or topics in the morning.  I also will send to you at 
that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through 
some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations 
on Friday.

Please call me when you wish to follow up.

John

Other than Grynberg, the only active case that involves the above-named 
entities is the Enterprise Products case, in which Enron Storage Company is a 
defendant.  My understanding is that that case has settled, but the 
documentation is not yet complete.  We have recently settled the Reeves, 
Poirier and Fontenot cases in which Louisiana Resources was a defendant, and 
those matters are now closed.

Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks.

Richard,
As I mentioned in my phone mail message to you, we are compiling info on the 
above-referenced entities in connection with a due diligence request by a 
potential purchaser. The prospective purchaser has requested information on 
the entities' litigation, whether complete, existing or pending including any 
eminent domain proceedings and insurance litigation. Could you let me know as 
soon as possible if you can provide me that information. The goal is to have 
all requested information in the data room early next week . 

Thank you,
Sandi

Sounds great--   but there aren't "provinces" in UK; and didn't she murder
some kid in Massachusetts?

>>> "scooper@bracepatt.com" 08/02/99 02:32pm >>>
I have a friend here from the UK who came to this county with a British
family as a nanny for their two girls.  She was told this weekend that
due to some financial difficulties they would no longer be able to continue
her employment.  She does not wish to return to England at this time and
is seeking to find another position with a family here ASAP.  The family
she is currently with would recommend her highly.  Her name is Elizabeth
Nugent and she comes from a very good family in northern England. (Her
father is governor of a province there.)   She is university educated in
child care and elementary education.  She is also NVQ (National
Vocational Qualification) Level 3 qualified and has taught in both the
private and public systems there in England.  She is twenty four years
old.  She has excellent references and letters of recommendation.  If you
or someone you know is seeking a well qualified British nanny please
contact me at (713) 221-1361 for more information.  Thank you.

It's a two way street, of course.  Have they expressed any interest in
negotiating?  There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing
particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.

Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?

As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is
not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that
our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke
clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen
ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP
(the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an
economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye?

Mike Diamond (for PaineWeber) has negotiated an agreement with Mike Swartz
that none of the defendants need respond to the pending discovery at this
time.  We will be having further discussions.  I think some of the
defendants "demurred" today rather than answering.  A demurrer is roughly
the state-court equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

I will keep you advised.

Subject: Pintail Production Company, Inc., New Contract Effective 1/1/2000

Attached is a copy of the Pintail Agreement you asked me to prepare.  The 
contract is effective 1/1/2000 for a term of 3 years at a price of 85% Inside 
Ferc HSC with a meter fee of $250 per meter.  Please take note of section 7.6 
of the agreement.  This section terminates the 70% Letter Agreement effective 
1/1/2000 and also states that Pintail is not a party to and has never been a 
party to the 1984 Conoco Agreement.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  If there are no changes to 
this Agreement, it is in a form that is ready to send to Pintail.  It is my 
understanding that you will send this with a release letter to Pintail.

Thanks,

Bob.\

Why don't I start sending you a brief e-mail every Friday summarizing
activities in the case for that week and what is coming up soon.  Nothing
fancy or time consuming, just a brief update

For example:

Today:

          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have to
disclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even about
March 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of
counsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred ruling
whether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998
concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find out
what this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)

          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by
Natwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don't think
Natwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am not
planning for  ECT Securities to take a position.

          (3)  We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, after
removing a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch's
statement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT
Securities.

Later this week:

        Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY.
 I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or not
say, about ECT Securities.


Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (and
also her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enron
for something concerning related party transactions?

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt

		 Subject: In re ICTS/Alabama Carriers vs. Scottsboro and ICTS

 This morning, I executed and telefaxed Enron Metals' agreement to defend and 
indemnify Scottsboro in this matter to Scottsboro.  I just received a 
voice-mail from Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, who said that the 
agreement looked fine to him.  He has referred me to his attorney, Tom 
Walker, of Walker, Johnston, Barton and Powell, out of Birmingham.  Walker is 
Scottsboro's usual attorney.  I have left an urgent message with Walker, who 
is out of the office in a seminar today, and won't be back in until tomorrow, 
to call me immediately about getting an extension of time to answer in this 
matter from the plaintiff.  The answer date is Monday.

 Richard, given that Walker is not defending us, but Scottsboro, and the 
small size of this case ($15,000), do we need to pass this by Jim Derrick for 
his approval?  Given the short time frame before an answer is due, I will go 
forward with retaining him provisionally, at least to get an extension of 
time.  I would be strongly inclined not to substitute any other counsel in, 
as it might give away that it is Enron Metals who is funding Scottsboro in 
this matter.

Your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money. The other 
thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two 
transactions as well.

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping

We are tangled up with all our regular clients, including SCE banks, SCE 
bondholders and other industry players like the power exchange etc.? We had 
along discussion this morning and concluded that we could not be exclusive to 
Enron without running afoul of other existing representations.? We appreciate 
your inquiry about our availability as we always enjoy working with you, but 
we do not want to hang you up because of our other directly related client 
engagements.? As I said last night, Ralph Maybe is a good choice, the others 
you mentioned not anywhere near as good.? There are also two other very high 
quality lawyer suggestions I? would make, and I would be happy to facilitate 
and introduction if you desire, although the firms are insolvency boutiques,? 
they are Howard Weg and Ken Klee both here in LA.? Call me when you get a 
chance.

Richard: 

Ahab Garos, a young intern at McDonald during 1997-98, was deposed in New 
York this week.? We concluded that this particular deposition was not worth 
the expense of our attending personally, but we will be obtaining a rough 
transcript tomorrow and a final one later.? It is unlikely that Garos had any 
significant contact with Enron, and Mike Swartz advised us before the 
deposition that he did not intend to ask any "Enron questions."

Next week Aaron Izowar of White & Case is being deposed.? We think we should 
attend that deposition, and Roland is planning on doing so, unless you 
disagree.? Izowar coordinated a lot of the work in preparing the offering 
memorandum and is likely to be asked about Enron's role in that process.

Brad:

First, let me say yes, if you want me to, I can write the company and "put
them on notice" that you will invoice them. Also, alert them that we would
consider court action if it occured again.  Let me know and I will proceed.

Second, yes, we could file an injunction if necessary Obviously that would
involve more time and expense, hearing, probably opposition by the other
company and see what a court would do.  We could use as grounds they have
already done it, are working in the area and, unless under court order to
stay a distance away, would be likely do it again.  Also, we could ask for
damages for everything involved by EBS, repair, disruption, etc.

Both of these are things that Richard Sanders would have a view on I am
sure, so I am cc'ing him on this.  Again, let me know what you would like to
do re court action.

I will await hearing from you.

John

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

Further to my discussion with Tim Nakaska, I confirm that we have $84,508.39 
in
out trust account as at March 28, 2000.
We have retained an amount of $47,000 relating to the Canada Customs & Revenue
Agency's trust claim, pending final determination as to entitlement.
We prepared a wire transfer of the US dollar equivalent of $35,000 CDN to the
same account as we transferred  funds to in September 1999.
The balance of  $2,508.39 has been retained  in our trust account to cover
incidentals. I am faxing our standard enclosure letter to your attention.

If you require any further information, please advise.

Regards,

Tom

Richard -

I have a company with whom we are negotiating a non-disclosure agreement.  We 
have been working off of their form, but have inserted our arbitration 
language.  We have put in New York as the operative law and they have 
responded with either Minnesota (their home jurisdiction) or Delaware (the 
state of their incorporation).  I have told them that Minnesota will not work 
and that we prefer NY, but they are holding the line on having Delaware.

Do we have a problem with Delaware for jurisdiction?  Also, this is a 
non-disclosure agreement and any subsequent  agreement would have to be 
negotiated as to forum.

Thanks for your response.

SDG&E is planning to file a motion in Judge Moreno's court requesting an
Order vacating (as moot) paragraph 6 of the Preliminary Injunction (which
permits participants to withhold amounts previously paid in charge-backs
from payments owing to the PX in connection with the normal invoicing
process) and stating that SDG&E is entitled to the amounts it has withheld
pursuant to paragraph 6.  SDG&E will argue that FERC clearly ordered the
charge-backs to be rescinded, and accordingly, that the reason for the
escrow no longer applies.

Please let us know whether you have any comments and/or would like to join
in this motion.

SDG&E is planning to file a motion in Judge Moreno's court requesting an
Order vacating (as moot) paragraph 6 of the Preliminary Injunction (which
permits participants to withhold amounts previously paid in charge-backs
from payments owing to the PX in connection with the normal invoicing
process) and stating that SDG&E is entitled to the amounts it has withheld
pursuant to paragraph 6.  SDG&E will argue that FERC clearly ordered the
charge-backs to be rescinded, and accordingly, that the reason for the
escrow no longer applies.

Please let us know whether you have any comments and/or would like to join
in this motion.

Richard,

I spoke with Leroy Lambert re Transammonia today.  He has not yet received 
the packet of information which you sent up to him, but if he doesn't receive 
it by Monday  he will call me and I will FedEx a copy to him.  Our answer 
date is July 6.  New York requires federal court style answers.  I have a 
meeting scheduled with Kim Godfrey at 11:30 am, Monday, June 28.  Please feel 
free to attend, if you would like.  I plan to e-mail a draft answer to Leroy 
by Wednesday, which he will check to make sure I have followed New York 
procedure & style and will then file before the end of next week.  I'll keep 
you advised of events as they occur.  Thanks.

Bonnie

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=
e=20
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=
=20
carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=
ne=20
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=
he=20
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits=
=20
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=
=20
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years=
=20
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=
=20
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =
or=20
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=
=20
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=
=20
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=
=20
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=
=20
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=
n=20
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=
 =20
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=
e=20
OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=
n=20
its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20
authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=
n.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=
=20
Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20
proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=
=20
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=
=20
indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20
elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=
y,=20
due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,=
=20
with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=
ng=20
PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=
o=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
=20
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=
re=20
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=
=20
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to=
=20
result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses=
=20
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position=
 or=20
results of operations.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=
=20
potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant=
=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=
=20
ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=
 and=20
sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=
=20
were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these=
=20
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=

Limor and Richard,

I would like to recommend that we use Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn & Stifel as 
our local counsel in Honolulu, the port where the M/V OBOD, and her cargo, 
are under arrest.  Although I do not have any personal experience with this 
law firm, I got their name from local admiralty attorneys who have access to 
the books published by the various P&I Clubs, which list what maritime 
attorneys each club has certified for use in each port.  The Goodsill, 
Anderson firm was mentioned by two different admiralty attorneys here in 
Houston as being listed by a number of different clubs for the port of 
Honolulu.  It is not at all unusual for admiralty attorneys to choose local 
counsel in this manner.

I have not yet received Goodsill, Anderson's proposed engagement letter, but 
will send it to you when I do.

I will call each of you tomorrow to get your thoughts on this firm.

Britt

		 Subject: Information Re Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel



Dear  Britt:
?
Per your  request, I am forwarding you copies of our firm's resume and 
billing  policies.? I am also forwarding personal resumes for two of my 
partners,  John Lacy and Mark Desmarais, both of whom do maritime work.? For 
reasons  discussed hereinbelow, I suggest that Mark and his associate, Randy 
Baldemor,  would be best suited to work on this matter.? The billing rates 
for Mark  and Randy are $245/hour and?$130/hour, respectively.
?
Two issues  turned up during our conflict check.? First, our firm represents 
Hawaiian  Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and its subsidiaries, including its 
three public  utility subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), 
Hawaii Electric  Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Company, 
Limited (MECO).?  Although we are not aware on any actual conflict between 
ENRON and HEI, HECO,  HELCO or MECO, we are cognizant that ENRON is a major 
player in the power  producing industry.? Accordingly, we would need to 
confirm that our  representation of ENRON in the present maritime matter 
would not preclude us  from representing HEI, HECO, HELCO or MECO in other 
matters in which such  companies' interests may be adverse to ENRON.? Please 
let me know as soon  as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable.
?
Second, as it  turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been 
tracking the M/V OBOD  and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.? 
The Seattle firm  retained our firm strictly to monitor the vessel and any 
actions with regard to  her arrest, but has neither asked for legal advice, 
nor disclosed who their  client is.? Mark does not believe that our firm's 
monitoring the status of  the vessel presents any conflicts with our 
representing ENRON.? He has  placed a call to the Seattle firm and expects?to 
hear back from his contact  later this afternoon.? Assuming our firm is 
engaged by ENRON, given that  they already know about the vessel, its recent 
history and the parties and  counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear 
best suited to assist you on this  matter.
?
Finally, I  passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be 
viewed  (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having 
abandoned its  interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.? Mark checked (on the 
premise that  our firm was being considered to be retained as Hawaii counsel) 
with Bryan Ho,  attorney for Nordic Technical Development, Inc., who 
indicated that he was not  aware of any passed or pending filing deadlines.
?
I will call you  tomorrow morning, Hawaii time, to discuss the two issues 
that came out of our  conflict check.? I look forward to resolving these 
issues to our mutual  benefit and to assisting ENRON on this matter.
?
Best  regards.

The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will 
hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack 
is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I 
predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack 
has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 
million.

Badak is still in dispute.  Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is

to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect

Aleck --

I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I
sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes,
almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked
Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard
from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind
Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San
Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I
told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he
offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the
appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just
approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I
still have seen nothing.

My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that
Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems
unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me
directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this
matter.

Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.

Larry



assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would
pay a retainer in advance.

		 Subject: PCA




Liz Austin, our  Connecticut counsel, has been asked to represent Arizona 
Public
Service Company and Griffin Energy Marketing, both of whom have recently been
sued by the PCA Trust.  As discussed below, we do not believe that there is 
any
adverse interest between Enron and these two companies, but Liz wanted you to 
be
comfortable with her concurrent representation of these two other defendants.
(As I may have mentioned before, many of the defendants in the joint defense
group are represented by one law firm.  There is a commonality of interest in
the defenses to the Trust's claims.)

The complaint against Arizona Public consists only of preference claims in the
amount of $300,000 and an objection to its $420,000 proof of claim.  Griffin
Energy has been sued for breach of contract, turnover, unjust enrichment,
fraudulent transfer, etc.  Total amount of claims equal $530,000.  With 
Griffin,
PCA failed to deliver power in May and the Griffin terminated its contract 
with
PCA before the energy spikes began to occur.

Liz has review the complaint against Enron and our draft answer and is aware 
of
our issues and defenses.  None of our defenses would be in conflict with the
defenses asserted by Arizona Power or Griffin.  If fact, many of the same
defenses would be raised.

Both Arizona Public and Griffin would agree that if any sort of issue conflict
came up in the future or if Enron became otherwise uncomfortable with the
concurrent representations, Liz would withdraw from representing Arizona Power
and Griffin and they will waive any right to assert a conflict or seek
disqualification.

Assuming that Arizona Public and Griffin Energy are not otherwise adverse to
Enron in other matters (which Liz did not believe they were), are you
comfortable with these concurrent representations?  I believe that there may 
be
some beneficial economies in the concurrent representations in that Liz's time
at hearings involving all defendants, etc. would be split among the 
defendants.
However, if you're uncomfortable, then that's the end of the analysis.

Liz is waiting to get back to Arizona Public and Griffin, so once you've
decided, please let me know.  Thanks.

Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a "poll" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting 
convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the 
litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on

One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Thanks
Gary

I do not care about the appearance.  There is no jury.  Morris won't care
and will understand why we paid for her to have a lawyer.  I do not want
Duke to have a private shot at her.

Subject: Document Retention Policy

The folks at East Coast Power inquired as to what is our document retention 
policy.  I understand it to be 6 months.  Is that still the case?  Is there a 
written statement of the policy that I can send to them?

I told them that the 6 month rule is a general rule, and would, of course, be 
subject to exceptions for any statutory, regulatory or contractual obligation 
to keep certain docuemtns for longer periods.  I also suggested to them that 
all docuemntation necessary to prove up the QF status of the plants should be 
keep for a substantially longer period, at least for the relevant limitations 
periods.  Do you agree?

Gentlemen:

As I mentioned in my earlier e-mail of this morning, I attach the latest 
versions of the letter to ExxonMobil and the chronology.  Again, I have 
deliberately softened the tone in the last paragraph of page 2 of the letter 
to wire around a potential problem caused by a 1995 letter from us to Mobil 
in the past about the role of ELSC.  We have also redrafted both the letter 
and chronology to reflect that the ELP, LP was a publicly traded company, so 
KN acquired only Enron's interest in it, not all of it.  We last redrafted 
the chronology to reflect that the partnership never actually owned the 
hydrocarbon recovery plant.

Mike has briefly reviewed these drafts and I understand has no problem with 
them (although I am resending them to him for him to review again if he 
wishes).  

Jim and Richard, once I have your respective comments/go ahead, I will send 
this to Eric Nichols by telefax this afternoon.  I will also give Nichols a 
heads-up that it is coming.

I await your response.

Britt

Brian's deposition is now firm for 1/18, 1/19, and possibly 1/20 in Houston. 
Let's plan on prep on 1/16 and 1/17.

McConville's deposition seems to have fallen off the radar screen again.

Hennegan also wants  to depose Julien Smythe at Akin Gump, which may be a
little troublesome fo us.

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)

		 Subject: CalPX FERC and Informational Meeting


Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation

Here is the list of counsel that attended today's conference call regarding
public events involving the California Power Exchange Corporation.  I
delayed publishing this list until 6:00 p.m. because I kept receiving emails
from interested parties.  I also received the following report from John
Stamper at O'Melveny & Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing the
California PX.  Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebacks
will be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable by
Thursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.  John asked for February 9th
rather than the 8th.  John raised again the possibility of a standstill
agreement.  Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstill
agreement if everybody agreed.  They are worried, however, about being sued
for failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.  John
pointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entities
that had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.  Bob then reported
that the number one option that the  CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.
It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.
They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedure
themselves.

We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 11:00
a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 2001.  The call in number is 1-800-205-3434,
participant code: 653687

I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for
1:00 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.  This would include
litigation alternatives.  We will distribute the dial in number and access
code for that call on Monday morning.

Proposed Agenda for 11:00 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:

I. Current Status of any proposed filings.
 Note:  Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me a
copy of a filing they made  with FERC on January 29th.  I will send a
copy under separate email cover.
II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violated
the tariff with respect to  specific PX Participants.  The purpose of
gathering these examples is to be able to  demonstrate that CalPX is
acting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.  This could
include identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PX
Participants or  inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant.

 For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads the
tariff, if you look at the  chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,
Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant  appears to be a fixed number
that  does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.     In
Phil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the gross
MWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%
of the default is paid through  chargeback because there is no provision for
recalculating the chargeback formula.

III. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back is
inconsistent with  tariff.
IV. Impact of Governor Davis' "commandeering" of SCE block forward
contracts.

Governor Davis Blocks Liquidation of Edison Contracts


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT: E. Jesus Arredondo
Friday, February 02, 2001
626.537.3155

Beth Pendexter

626.537.3154


Pasadena, CA- California Governor Gray Davis issued a last minute Executive
Order prohibiting the California Power Exchange from liquidating Southern
California Edison's forward positions.  The liquidation proceeding is an
attempt to recover approximately $250 million Edison is in default on to
CalPX market participants.

Davis' Executive Order nullifies a Los Angeles County Superior Court
decision that earlier today authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forward
market positions. The following is excerpt from Governor Davis' Executive
Order:

 It is ordered that the contracts and trades in the market for the
sales and purchases of forward contracts and trades for electricity (known
as the "Block Forward" market) for the delivery of electricity possessed by
Southern California Edison Company*is hereby commandeered by the State of
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State
of California.

CalPX will transfer the Edison contracts to the State of California. State
law requires that the state shall pay "the reasonable value thereof," and
based on competitive market conditions today, CalPX determined the value of
these contracts, for 2,846,000 megawatt hours, at over $651 million.


- 30 -

CalPX is a non-profit public benefit corporation established in 1998 with
the passage of AB1890, which restructured the electric utility industry
within the state of California.

> sound legal grounds.  Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing
> on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is
> supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes
> sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its
> motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
> from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
> hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the
> motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially
> different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application
> to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.
> Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a
> tentative order as of November 1, 2000.
>
>  Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept "most
> favored nation" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests
> by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that
> was available.  However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need

> objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's
> threatened motion to compel before FERC.

>  We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission
> has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been

> delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=

impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.
 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=

state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan), an Enron subsidiary, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity.  Although San Juan did not=
=20
provide service to the building, the National Transportation Safety Board=
=20
(NTSB) concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin=
g=20
from San Juan=01,s distribution system.  San Juan and Enron strongly disagr=
ee. =20
The NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan=01,s system to=

building and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion.  Enron=

San Juan, and four San Juan affiliates have been named, along with several=

third parties, as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District=20
Court for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico=
. =20
These suits, which seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, busine=

and its affiliates, among others, caused the explosion.  Enron, San Juan an=

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=
n=20
of Trojan.  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon,=
=20
found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling fr=
om=20
the same court.  The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1=
995=20
general rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of i=
ts=20
remaining investment in Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon=
=20
Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1=
995=20
order.  Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling,=20
which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at=
=20
the Oregon Court of Appeals.  On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the=
=20
State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG=
E=20
to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan=
=20
generating facility.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s authorization of PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=

investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=

of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati=

facility.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=

I have had several more conversations that convince me that FERC will provide 
very helpful answers to the three quesitions that Robin sent to me regarding 
FERC's jurisdiction over the issues in the California cases.

You should be aware of timing issues.  Two of FERC's five positions (both 
Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated 
candidates.  Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be 
helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court 
judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the  two new nominees are seated, there 
may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations 
hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.

I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that 
she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our 
timing.

Plaintiff has canceled the hearing on its motion for summary judgment, which 
was set for this Friday.  Since I am sure they will re-set it if immediate 
settlement progress is not made, Ecogas has a window of opportunity to work 
out an acceptable deal.  However, I suspeect the window is not a very big one.

Our goal was to buy time.  Whether we bought it or not, we now have it.  I 
will get together with Randy and Jerrel to make sure we use it effectively.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Jeff,

I attach an affidavit in support of MG's claim against Base Metal Trading Ltd 
to release an escrow order over aluminium cargoes held in the Port of 
Baltimore - this also gives a brief description of the facts.

In short, Base Metal Trading have obtained an attachment order in respect of 
the goods; however, MG is claiming that title to the goods is vested in MG.  
I will send you separately other correspondence, and will keep you posted as 
to progress.

Richard,

We plan on sending this demand letter (and an identical one to the other 
co-owner) out today.  
Ann Elizabeth wanted me to run it by you before we send it out.  Please let

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)

Subject: Can Fibre Lackawanna Letter of Credit

Attached is my first attempt to frame the applicable provisions regarding 
Enron's obligation to increase its Stabilization Fund letter of credit by 
$4.5 million on the Completion Date.  It appears that the major issues are 
(1) can they pass the Endurance Benchmark (24 day test) and (ii) that the 
estimated cost to complete the facility is in excess of amounts in the 
Interest Subaccount, Construction Fund, and Equity Contribution Account.  I 
am currently thinking that if it cost more than $4.5 million to complete the 
facility, senior lenders may not want to pursue completion in order to obtain 
our $4.5 million.

Robert/Richard - Montauk called yesterday and they've reached a tentative 
settlement w/ WMI at Davis St.  They sent the most current draft but I can't 
open it.  I've sent a message back asking them to resend but thought (at 
least Robert) y'all might be able to open it and provide feedback.  Please 
call/advise asap.  Thanks!

Plaintiffs are available to mediate on Aug. 25, and so is Mike  Miller.? I am 
just waiting to hear back from IBC's lawyer on his client's  availability.

I assume that day is OK for you, as you had indicated that you  could do it 
any day that week.? If so, I will send around a confirming  letter just as 
soon as I hear back from IBC.

I need a referal to  oppose Susan Myers.? Evidently she is very aggressive

Dear Mr. Sanders - 
?
While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, 
I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well...
?
We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such 
as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our 
educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to 
the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the 
Protocol.

I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American  
Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for 
eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small 
working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial 
service  offerings.

Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology 
consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a 
day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, 
legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about 
our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief  
description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for  
discussion at the meeting.

The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services 
to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very 
concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment.

We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction 
of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, 
and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004).
?
Thanks.

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).



Thanks,
Alan

Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: SGSI litigation threat:  our response

Eric, here is my response to the paragraph (in SGSI's letter concerning the 
money due for SGSI's work on the GeoQual web map project) which is underlined 
on page 3 and which takes the position that if we did not have a written 
Statement of Work in place, then SGSI owns all the work it did for us and we 
must cease use of it.  You and Laura might want to use this paragraph in your 
response to all his other business-related arguments.  (I might add, for the 
record and as a point for the future, that we can easily get into this kind 
of trouble when we don't take care to obtain signed Statements of Work before 
the work starts.)

Here it is:

Mr. Schlosser, your letter states that the ePower Locator, GeoQual, Hamachi, 
and Mountain Top applications are SGSI's intellectual property because the 
parties do not have an executed Statement of Work.  This argument is 
incorrect.  Both parties are bound by the fully executed professional 
services contract, which clearly states in Article 17 that all material 
developed by Consultant (SGSI) "shall become the property of Company (EBS) 
when prepared."  Because the work, whether or not covered in a written 
Statement of Work, was requested by EBS and performed by SGSI (subject to 
EBS' concerns about such performance),  the work is clearly covered by the 
Professional Services Contract, and the foregoing statement of ownership 
applies.  Accordingly, EBS respectfully refuses your requests concerning such 
work.





Eric and Laura, I would be happy to look at the balance of the letter, once 
you've written it.  You have my permission to go hard on these folks, if 
their work was poor and there was no EBS authorization for them to run up 
such high charges.


Kenton

Richard,

I have attached an e-mail forwarded to Claude Chandler (FM Global) in 
response to an earlier e-mail from him and another e-mail received last 
Friday stating their new position.  I will also send to you the e-mails from 
Claude I mentioned in the preceeding sentence.  

I will follow this with a phone call to you this morning so I can bring you 
up to speed on the activity associated with this insurance claim.  One item 
that needs your immediate attention is a provision in the Insurance Policy 
that could hamper our ability to litigate if this becomes our only viable 
alternative to resolve the differences.  There is a deadline for litigation 
tied to the date of the initial failure (one year which would make it June 
15, 2001).  It also requires that prior to litigation, the parties need to 
first resolve through dispute resolution/arbitration.  It has been my 
experience that arbitration normally takes 90-120 days.  There is only one 
defined action with days attached to it in the policy (60 days to establish 
reps for each party).  I think you see the dilemna.

I look forward to our discussion.

Thanks, Ron.

Claude,

In regard to your e-mail dated February 7th, we will be sending to you 
(tomorrow for overnight delivery) documentation in support of our claim and 
responses to address other open issues as stated in your e-mail.  The 
information will address the following:

Previous detail and summaries of the original insurance claim amount of 
$6,452,318.02
New detail and summaries for Enron's current position, including --
detailed labor breakdowns for services provided by Elliott and NEPCO.  This 
will identify labor hours and charges by: day, craft, individual, rate 
classification if applicable (i.e., straight time, over time and double 
time), etc.
Support for overhead charges applicable to NEPCO's billing
Support for other charges associated with Unit I claim not previously 
identified (i.e., insurance for the repair period for Unit I)
Detail and summaries of other NEPCO services provided but not associated with 
Unit I repair/claim
Letters or documentation in support of major scope differences

Note: The detail related to the NEPCO charges will follow (by end of this 
week). 

In addition, I spoke with Grady James, the Doyle Facility Plant Manager, and 
he indicated that the "System 700" documentation prepared by NEPCO was made 
available to you at the site.  This documentation was provided along with the 
Unit 1-3 refurbishment documentation.  Fortunately, this information 
continues to be maintained at the site and is available for your review (at 
the site) if you wish.  In regard to other documentation or notes, the 
information forwarded by Russ Porter in early February should have satisfied 
all previous requests.  If there is a specific request beyond what we have 
already forwarded, we will respond accordingly.

You also indicated in your e-mail a desire to directly contact 
sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work.  As a result of 
confidentiality provisions within the service agreements, I would request 
that you indicate to me who you would like to contact and we will provide the 
necessary waivers to those parties.   

Last, we just received your e-mail (dated Friday, Feb. 23) related to FM 
Global's current position.  Obviously we are disappointed that the two 
parties are this far apart.  Can I assume that this position reflects 
everything you characterized as outstanding in your e-mail (i.e., awaiting 
signoff from Charlie McCorckle and others)?  I assume we will have questions 
as we continue to review the material.  Should we forward those to you?  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments on 713-853-9298.  
Thanks, Ron.

Richard:
      I spoke to Healey last night about this.We arre in agreement that one 
lawyer should argue this and it should be a local lawyer. Healey's firm did 
the papers. Bob Steiner is a the most senior lawyer at that firm, is highly 
regarded, former Bar President and I would assume is well known to Moskowitz. 
As such this is acceptable to me, particularly with Healey providing the 
back-up. I suspect it was my call to Healey that prompted this e-mail.

I have instructed Jerry Odom, our FVP site representative, that all accidents 
reports he receives regarding the injury accident of the Jomax employee last 
week are only to be provided to myself, Jake, or Sheila.  Jerry received 
reports today from Jomax and CIG but NEPCO is still refusing to provide 
theirs.  Please let me know if there is anyone else you would like on

Richard,
 Please let me know what, if anything, I can do to assist you all in 
determining when to make the settlement payment in this matter.  As you know, 
if the payment is made before January, the interest is avoided.  I will keep 
you posted if I receive anything from Clyde & Co.  Otherwise, please call if 
I can do anything further to help out.  Thanks.

		 Subject: CalPX FERC and Informational Meeting


Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation

Here is the list of counsel that attended today's conference call regarding
public events involving the California Power Exchange Corporation.  I
delayed publishing this list until 6:00 p.m. because I kept receiving emails
from interested parties.  I also received the following report from John
Stamper at O'Melveny & Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing the
California PX.  Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebacks
will be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable by
Thursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.  John asked for February 9th
rather than the 8th.  John raised again the possibility of a standstill
agreement.  Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstill
agreement if everybody agreed.  They are worried, however, about being sued
for failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.  John
pointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entities
that had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.  Bob then reported
that the number one option that the  CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.
It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.
They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedure
themselves.

We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 11:00
a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 2001.  The call in number is 1-800-205-3434,
participant code: 653687

I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for
1:00 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.  This would include
litigation alternatives.  We will distribute the dial in number and access
code for that call on Monday morning.

Proposed Agenda for 11:00 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:

I. Current Status of any proposed filings.
 Note:  Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me a
copy of a filing they made  with FERC on January 29th.  I will send a
copy under separate email cover.
II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violated
the tariff with respect to  specific PX Participants.  The purpose of
gathering these examples is to be able to  demonstrate that CalPX is
acting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.  This could
include identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PX
Participants or  inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant.

 For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads the
tariff, if you look at the  chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,
Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant  appears to be a fixed number
that  does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.     In
Phil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the gross
MWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%
of the default is paid through  chargeback because there is no provision for
recalculating the chargeback formula.

III. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back is
inconsistent with  tariff.
IV. Impact of Governor Davis' "commandeering" of SCE block forward
contracts.

I will copy the writ to each of you immediately.

Mr. Sanders, as you now have the privilege of handling our litigation, I am 
looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point 
of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the 
courtroom work?

FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis 
Delewski against CIGSA, did a fine job, and knows the players, and I would be 
glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do. 

Randy Pais will work it from within EEOS legal. 

I have not yet notified Jim Derrick, thinking that either you or Mark might 
want to. I am quite happy to call him if you like.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a 
messaging system that won't let me leave a message. That's ok today because I 
need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of 
you when I need to. I wonder if Bracewell's Wash. office has the same 
problem?

Hi Richard,

I wanted to discuss with you two open items with you re: our voice recorder 
policy.

On the authorization to listen to conversations, we cannot comply with the 
requirement that an MD authorize it because we have no MD on site.  Given the 
size of our office, etc. I can suggest some people that would be appropriate 
in lieu of an MD.  Insofar as who should be present, we are suggesting that 
the IT person be present to run the playback, together with myself and the 
person who authorized the playback.

On the retention policy, the policy presently applicable is fine for most of 
our personnel.  One of our companies, Enron Trading Services Inc. is 
regulated by the CFTC and the NFA, who impose a 5 year records keeping 
requirement.  We can purchase a separate system for the traders in that 
company for a cost of about $20,000.  

Please let me know when you will have a moment to discuss.

Thanks,

Limor

Richard,  we have heard nothing definitive.  The clerk at Brick Court 
Chambers did mention recently that due to backlog at the court we may not get 
there until May of 2001, but we certainly cannot rely on that.  The new term 
opens October 1, so in principle we could go any time after that date.  I am 
predicting toward the end of 1Q 2001.

wanted to send you the draft for your interim consideration and understanding.

My trial obviously is running longer than anticipated.  I do not have a good
sense of when it will end.  It will be at least several more weeks.  It
obviously is nearly impossible to do any real preparation for the next trial
while I am still in this one, although Carrin and I have been speaking
regularly and materials have been shipped here for me to review.  Let's
discuss.

Are we running into a problem with the Nov. 3 trial setting?

Read the attached affidaviot which Steve Schindler faxed me.  Glatzer seems
to create interesting and exotic jurisdictional issues wherever he goes.
And to think I never had known there was a Mrs. Bernbie and, apparently, a
little Bernie Jr. and Bernadette.  As to your question, Steve, who knows?
Perhaps this will become the new outlet for Bernie's pro bono talents.  But
with him you never know.  The negative view would be:  he is still
litigating his 1986 divorce decree 15 years later, so why do we think he
will leave us alone now or next decade?  The only thing I am looking forward
to is his Complaint against Hayes....

 Are you guys aware of this case?  Is this "the" antitrust case? It is filed

Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron
affiliate and they are likely aware of it.  Just in case, I am forwarding
this message to our Houston headquarters for their handling.  Please do not
engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be
controlled by the business unit attorney responsible for that affiliate.
Thanks for your awareness of this filing.

Don - the draft looks good. My only thought is that we may not need to
require that the posted copies be file stamped. It seems to me that this
requirement could cause some delay. Moreover, the hard copies people get
by ordinary service are not file stamped. Given that my client is
continuing to incur copying costs, I ask that you  try to get this
proposal circulated as quickly as possible. Thanks- Barrett

In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be 
admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It 
is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the 
following language:

The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in 
any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for 
those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable 
jurisdiction.

It is really not the record retention policy that drives this decision, it is 
the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued. Gary 
Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.

we are about to move a bunch of desks up here.  as people move their desks,

stooping so low as to hurl infantile insults at your youngest and

corporate slavin', too big house buyin', Hilton Head Renaissance
Weekend wannabe attendin', power tie wearin', Houston rationalizin',
adult-oriented rock easy listenin', chilluns with mutant voices
sirin' and coke bottle-itis lookin' knucklehead!

the matter of the telephone # is one of some confusion at the moment,
for mama claims she cannot reach me.  for a long while the following
was it:

001 81 06 696 2566

but this year osakatown added an extra number, a 6, making it:

001 81 06 6696 2566

it should be no worry, and inside merry old nippon it has not been.
mama has problems, but they should not be from this side.  joel
reached me two weeks ago.

would like to hear from you, brotherman, but hurry not.  i am going
nowhere anytime soon.  later for you -

Richard:

Enclosed is a draft of the Affidavit that I believe conforms to what we
discussed with Brian this morning.  Please let me know if there is anything
that is not correct.  If it is fine, please have Brian sign it and have his
signature notarized.  I will then send a messenger to pick up the final,
signed affidavit.

Thanks,

Subject: NSM Suits in CA



I spoke with Legg Madson's lawyer today.  He said that his complaint was
done in haste and that he had not really thought everything through yet.  He
said he would be glad to consider any written or oral showing we may wish to
offer as to why ECT should not be in the suit.  (I made a brief pitch about
why would we invest $30m just to get $750K as a fee for defrauding
ourselves.  The lawyer seemed to understand.)  Richard, we should now decide
how to proceed.  I would suggest a phone call with Legg Mason's counsel that
you participate in, going over the facts and offering to supply documents to
support what we say.

Lisa, could you fax me a copy of the signed agreement with Oaktree in which
ECT/Enron agreed to some continuing cooperation with Oaktree in the
litigation.  Mike Swartz is calling us about that

Item #11 (retained) has changed and needs to be updated on the schedule.  
Pintail has elected not to accept our proposal and has submitted termination 
under the contract.  Their future actions are unknown at this time.

The potential arbitration proceedings with Shanghai needs to be added to the 
list as a retained litigation.  Contact Britt Davis for details.

Item #3 (unretained) probably needs to clarify the current situation.  In 
this proceeding, it is my understanding that HPL has already condemned the 
property and posted the appropriate bond as per the Court order.  The 
landowners were not satisfied with the findings of the Commissioners and have 
filed suit seeking a higher value.

It is unknown at this time whether there will be any litigation that comes 
out of the A/S pipeline rupture incident in Mt Belvieu.

 Richard,

 Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product ("Elang 
Crude, fit for export"), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
with a transmittal letter signed by him.

 Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.

 Britt

     "I attach an amended draft with the amendments highlighted in black."

I attach the draft hereto and apologise for the delay.

		 Subject: CATS litigation

The House of Lords have notified us that they will give their decision in the 
CATS litigation on Wednesday 4 April.  The decision is being handed down 
approximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan 
Sumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  
(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to 
do the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning 
the Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the 
individual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a 
decision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not 
writing the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the 
ruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently 
likelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are 
unlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we 
believe we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up 
value by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not 
make an offer of settlement.  

We expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement 
will be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each 
of you is contacted as soon as possible with the result.

		 Subject: Wright case  --  VPP

As you might recall, I have been given the lead on the volumetric production
payment issue in the Wright case in general, and in dealing with EOG in
particular.

As you know, I have heard the long story from EOG.   You suggested that the
next time I was in Houston that we try to meet with Julia Heintz Murray to
get the more to point version from the ECT / Enron perspective.

I will be in town next week for the "measurement summit."  I could come
earlier, stay later, or carve out some time during to talk to Julia.  This
might be a good introduction for Andy as well.  (Of course, Barrett is also
included if his schedule permits.)

>From the viewpoint of my schedule, I would suggest Thursday afternoon,
Tuesday afternoon, or Friday morning, in approximate order of preference.
Let me know.

Yes I have.  He's a very nice guy who is anxious to see his daughter.  I've
tried to contact Michael Coury but he has not called me back yet.  I have
tried him again today.  Hopefully he has seen the light since you talked
with him last.  Felix told me his story and from his perspective, there
doesn't seem to be anything that would allow the grandparents to maintain
custody of Alexis.  I'm going to work through HVLP to hopefully resolve this
matter in the Texas court.  I will be happy to keep you updated with my
progress.

Richard Bianchi has proposed August 20 for the arbitration, which he believes 
will not last more than a day..  Does that work for you and our possible 
witnesses,if any? Short of the offtakers, which Max is concerned about 
involving, who would you have in mind--since we are posturing  this as an msj 
case?  If the date works, I would suggest that we try to depose McKenna as 
soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we really need. 
Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the other 
arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind of 
scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.

I am familiar with one active case and one threatened litigation involving 
the companies on the Investment Portfolio list.  Steel Dynamics has been sued 
for securities fraud involving the NSM transaction.  Cgas has been threatened 
with litigation by Jerry Jordan, the former CEO.  Jerry Jordan disagrees with 
Cgas' evaluation of the stock he retained (which is subject to a buyout 
provision).  We think it is worth +/- 500,000.  He thinks it is worth +/- 1.5 
million.

ECT is willing to pay 25%,but we will not agree to pick up any of EOTT's 
share.

Subject: Re: DOJ Royalty Inquiry  

Britt, I did receive a copy of the V&E invoice, but EOTT has not agreed to a 
25% cost allocation for this matter.  EOTT is not a party to any of the 
contracts involving the "sample leases" that are referenced in the subpoena, 
and the subpoena does not appear to be directed to the types of business that 
are conducted by EOTT.  As indicated in memos from Charles Tetrault,  the 
document requests are focused on EOG and ECT.  EOTT is not going to pay 25% 
of the legal fees associated with EOG's and ECT's response to this subpoena.

I do not have a problem with paying 25% of this first bill ($1,250.79), 
because it was worth $1,250.79 to learn that EOTT probably will not have to 
provide any documents that are responsive to this subpoena.  However, until 
someone can convince me that the DOJ is actually interested in some EOTT 
transactions, I will not advise EOTT to contribute more than 5% to this 
effort in the future.  If we cannot agree on an allocation to EOTT that is 
less than 5%, then EOTT will need to make separate arrangements with respect 
to the minimal representation that it will apparently require with respect to 
this matter.

Of course, should circumstances change such that EOTT becomes a focus of this 
investigation, then we would be willing to pay a greater share of these legal 
fees.  Currently, however, EOTT transactions do not appear to be of interest 
to the DOJ, and EOTT should not be allocated 25% of the legal fees associated 
with responses by other Enron affiliates to this subpoena.

Please call me next week so that we may discuss EOTT's participation in this 
matter.

Go ahead and order the computer battery for Gail Brownfeld.

You  need to get approval from Richard Sanders by e-mail so you will have a 
record he approved it (because he is the cost center owner) before you order 
the flat panel for Michelle Blaine.  Please note, the standard flat panel for 
our department is a 15" panel, definitely not an 18".    When Richard 
approves it you can go ahead and order the flat panel through iBuyit.  

The usual procedure for our department is the cost center owner needs to 
approve any requests for computer equipment before they are purchased.

Thanks.  I hope you are doing well.

Richard and Elizabeth,

At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of 
the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the 
memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our 
Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to 
analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these 
strategies.

Steve

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

       Tom Nicholas and Steve Williams for Wright Case
       (others who received earlier message)
From: Don Schultz
Re: Joint Defense Meeting - progress notes.

We received several votes in favor of Charles Tetrault's suggestion to
meet the week after the Feb. 22 hearing, rather than on Feb. 23-24, and
that makes sense to us as well.  Tom Nicholas advises that the Wright
group would like the meeting to be held February 27-28 in Houston,
rather than Denver.   Jay Barrymore would prefer the meeting be held
March 5-6 in Denver.  Clay Latimer is available February 27-28 and would
prefer the meeting be held in Denver.  I was unable to reach Clay this
afternoon to determine if March 5-6 would work for him.  We have
confirmed availability among hotels in downtown Denver to host for
either date window.  Some of the Wright folks are reportedly checking on
availability of Houston hotels for February 27-28.  The Kansas Steering
Committee is meeting by phone tomorrow morning, and we will need to come
to a final decision in the next day or two on which to base meeting
plans.  Wright lead defense counsel are concentrated in Houston, and so
it might make sense for the Wright group to meet independently and in a
different location; however, there are a number of counsel who will need
to attend both meetings, so the meetings probably should not be at the
same time in different cities.  Thus far, we have not announced plans to
any of the JDT groups at large.

Liz/Richard

I suggest that we seek to rely upon Section 18(c) which says that 
"....pending resolution of the disagreement by arbitration, Seller shall 
continue to operate the Plant in a manner consistent with this Agreement and 
Consumers shall continue to pay all charges required in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of this Agreement."
 
Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed 
by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until 
any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each 
stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute 
resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers 
should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few 
years.
 
Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with 
a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of 
specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that 
they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute 
resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to 
seek such equitable relief.
 
We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always 
playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be 
out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not 
get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be 
no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them 
to delay any resolution of this dispute.
 
I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of 
documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our 
case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better 
understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made 
against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be 
collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved 
in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Sandy-

I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power
Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the
capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak
= $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus
Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh,
Off Peak = $43.60/MWh.

Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward
it others in your shop.

Thanks,

Ketan

Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if
Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January
2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of
February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should
be sent to Consumers Energy.

In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct
capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and
requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the
correct capacity charge.

Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further.

Kind regards.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Richard,

With regard to the removal of the Pier 23 case, it is unclear whether Enron
Corp. and EES were properly served.

We have the following documents:

* Memorandum from Becky Stephens indicating "Simultaneous service on
Enron Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc."
* A CT System Service of Process transmittal form verifying service on
EPMI on 1/30/2001

However, we do not have CT System Service of Process transmittal forms
verifying service on either Enron Corp or EES.

If these forms exist, please have someone forward them either to me or Jane
Chen.  If not, we need to discuss whether these entities waive any defects
in service and join in the removal.

Sorry about the delay in getting back to you. I would do a separate heading. 
I am not sure who needs to approve this other than me. When Whalley was head 
trader and COO, he approved. I do not know if it should be Lavo or Delainey. 
If you know, send it to me and I will get it signed. If you are uncertain, my

Richard, further to my voice-mail, I was just following up as to how you 
would like to proceed with addressing Enron Canada Corp. in the new tape 
retention policy.  As I had indicated, Rob Milnthorp has requested that the 
following two Enron Canada positions have authority to approve the listening 
of voice recordings in the Calgary office, on behalf of Enron Canada Corp.:

Chief Executive Officer
Head of Trading

Rob's preference is not to specify particular persons but to identify the 
titles instead.

Can you let me know how you would like to address this issue.  I would think 
it is merely a matter of adding these two positions to the schedule 
identifying who has authority to approve the listening of the tapes.  The 
only problem is that the "Managing Director" wording could conflict with the 
title identification that Rob wants to use for Enron Canada.  Perhaps in that 
schedule, we could add a separate heading for Enron Canada.

Thanks

Greg

Max-- I asked Bonnie White to assist me on this matter because I have been 
swallowed up on another project. Bonnie is with the Enron Litigation Unit and 
spends most of her time on ENA litigation issues. I know what is happening 
and I am still very much involved. If a lawsuit  is filed Ileana Blanco at 
Bracewell will be our trial atty. Her role is small at this stage.

As I indicated in my voice mail message to you, Bonnie White is an Enron

They are trying to learn more about the history of the McKenna project to be

effort to prevent the filing of litigation by McKenna.

Good job on your conversation. Unless Max wants to pay some nominal amount of 
money to simply get rid of them, I would advise that we do nothing. We could 
write a letter confirming the substance of your conversation and warn them

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Subject: Enterprise Rent-A-Car/ENA (Mark Van Scoyk); DOL: 2/9/00

I received a telephone call this past Friday from a Mr. Jes Jensen 
(406-238-1900) who is located in Montana and who claimed to be the insurance 
agent for the propane tanker which was struck by Mr. Van Scoyk.  He was 
wanting me to participate in a 9:30am conference call this morning with his 
clients as the claims that they are getting the run around from the rental 
company and he was hoping we could do something as we were Mr. Van Scoyk's 
employer.

I called him back and advised that Mr. Van Scoyk was not our employee, but 
rather an independent contractor who was performing Land Man services.  He 
wanted to know why he had an Enron North America business card, and that the 
number that was on it was to an ENA office in Denver, I believe.  He said 
that he certainly was holding himself out to be our employee.

He said his clients have sustained both property damage, and loss of use for 
not being able to deliver propane; yet, he could not tell me if they have 
mitigated their damages by having the vehicle repaired (I find this strange 
since he is their agent).  I told him he needed to look to Enterprise 
(although Mr. Van Scoyk) did not purchase liability coverage, and after them, 
Mr. Van Scoyk's personal auto carrier.  He said Enterprise had no 
responsibility to handle this matter as he did not purchase any liability 
coverage.  Also, he intimated that the personal auto carrier for Mr. Van 
Scoyk has (or was in the process of) denying the claim since Mr. Van Scoyk 
was using the rental vehicle for "business purposes" (he also advised that 
Mr. Van Scoyk worked this area all the time, had used his personal auto in 
the process, but that it was in the shop that day for repairs).

I advised Mr. Jensen to forward me whatever information he possessed that 
would assist me in this matter, to include a photocopy of the aforementioned 
business card.  Do you know if ENA obtains business cards for independent 
contractors such as Mr. Van Scoyk?  Is there any chance of obtaining the 
actual signed copy of the CONSULTING SERVICES AGREEMENT sent to Mr. Van 
Scoyk, short of going to his family?  Does anyone from ENA validate the 
insurance requirements of the aforementioned AGREEMENT, such as obtaining a 
copy of the pertinent declarations page or the policy itself for review?

Who in the field can I discuss this matter with futher as I am interested in 
further exploring our relationship to Mr. Van Scoyk and would like to speak 
with someone first-hand.  Mr. Jensen was told to call me by a Ken Choice 
(Joyce?) or Jessica Winthrop when he called the number on Mr. Van Scoyk's 
business card.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be appreciated.  I will forward to 
you whatever is faxed to me by Mr. Jensen.

Thanks,

Rob

Subject: DOJ Indiana Investigation: Privileged & Confidential



Richard -- Yesterday, I received a call from Jill Ptacek, a lawyer from the
DOJ's Antitrust Division, regarding the remaining aspects of the DOJ's
Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next
week.  Please let me know who we can make available for 60-90 minutes.
Thanks. -- Paul Yde (202-639-6685)

 In looking at the Natole file today it was brought to my attention that we
have an outstanding bill for legal fees and expenses unpaid from February.

 The bill is invoice 00020782 dated 2/29/00 in the amount of $17,312.28.

 Could you please have someone look for this one and see if it can be
approved for payment?  Thanks in advance for your help.

this part of the Ice Drilling settlement?  Should we expect any future cash 
proceeds?

Thanks,

Mike

In case you haven't heard, the Supreme Court has granted cert of our and the 
state of New York's cert petitions on the extent of FERC's jurisdiction over 
transmission facilities.

Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's 
grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888 
on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a 
grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate 
Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory 
in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are 
asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be 
noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. 
petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  
Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next 
week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

Richard,
 Mike Day just told me that he has obtained a 60 day extension for
all proceedings before the PUC in the SCE case.  Thus, there will be no
hearing on Thursday on our motion to dismiss.

Thanks

I called Lowell last week to see which Enron entity  was involved with this " 
friendly transaction" which created the potential conflict. I have not heard

I did not participate in the call last week because I thought it was only 
concerning financial consultants. Shortly before the meeting,a more detailed 
agenda arrived by e-mail(which may be par for the course but I find 
irritating). Please find out 1) what was decided and 2) what is the agenda 
for tues. Thanks

		 Subject: Power Exchange


The Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.  The list included 
PriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.  The 
preference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in 
creation of the Power Exchange systems.  There was an obvious concern about 
the potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.  In that 
regard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants 
than attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a 
problem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases, 
(4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the 
underlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and 
challenging numbers in claims litigation).  We've asked PW for assurances 
that if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the 
participants' position.  We're waiting for a response.  For the moment, no 
second choice has been identified.
Before the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.  He's frustrated with Joe 
Eisenberg.  Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer 
litigation responsibility to the participants committee.  Consequently, Cohen 
went ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.  Evidently Eisenberg is about 
to sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on 
shortened time.  I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to 
prepare a liquidating plan.  In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the 
creditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of 
available cash to support a plan.  Not surprisingly, the creditors came back 
asking for $18 million.  Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10 
million range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the 
participants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.  Cohen is 
giving thought to how we make that case.  If we can agree on a number, we can 
get rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a 
liquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.
Cohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE 
committee.  He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a 
seat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as 
Enron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of 
Power Exchange participants.  Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that 
comes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than 
encouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the 
PGE case?  Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in 
that regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that 
particular issue, we'd abstain.
I see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to 
release collateral.  Is that something we'd consider joining?  Bob Nelson

Richard,

     The only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis.
 The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained by
Robins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named.  Mr. Cobb's
report did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not
designate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his
deposition.  We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.

     Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and
damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.  Roland has a scheduling
conflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.  The subject on which we want to
ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the
initial offering.  This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and
Jonathan is on top of it.

     I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.  Gerry
worked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he
thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.  He is
very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30
days.  I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best
effort going forward.  I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.

     Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to
interrogatories from us.  It is much ado about nothing.  We just want to deal
with it in the least expensive way.

     Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including
in CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee
conversations.  My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,
and Natwest is trying to limit their losses.

     We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. 
It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. 
The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro
rata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law
doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault.
 The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against
ECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation causes of action.  How all of this works together is
virtually uncharted.

     With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the
defendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a
determination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the
current pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.  If Enron goes
to trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could
collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other
defendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether
such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.  We are working on a
memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.  I think you will
find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can
get the price low enough.)

I spoke again with Ely Goldin of Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev & Marks, who
represent Base Metals.  I told him we have paid for the material and have
clean
bills of lading.  He said they weren't looking to "jam anybody up" and woul=
d
try
to resolve the situation upon receipt of our paperwork (which I have just
received from Keith Whitehead) indicating our payment for the material and
our
rightful ownership of same.

Unless this matter is otherwise resolved, their intention is to let the
vessel
continue discharging and seize the material thereafter.
Rukert Terminals advised me that a U.S. Marshall and two lawyers have
already
been onboard the vessel and have confirmed this.  Discharge is continuing
with
our cargo expected to be completed by next Wednesday.  I've conferred with
our
lawyer, Arthur Taylor, and will fax the documents to Goldin this afternoon,
who
will look them over and get back to me tomorrow.

Regards,
Bob Klide

Bob, Nicole and Jean,

WELCOME BACK !!!

Following received from Orwell............. (Plse see attached below)
...............

Now we have to act quickly, but all moving in the same direction.

If we assume the entire cargo will be attached once the discharge operation=
=20
has
finished, then we should all realise that this represents $5,000,000.00 of =
our
money tied up on the quay, not to mention the inability to deliver against =
our
existing commitments.

We have couriered about 60 pages of further documents we received from=20
Aluminium
of Siberia proving the chain of ownership from the smelter to Aluminium of
Siberia and with copies of the RWB showing the metal was all despatched wit=
hin
April from the smelter.

Have we placed Base metal on notice that now they have attached the metal w=
e
reserve the right to counter sue for all costs and expenses WE may suffer a=
s a
result of their attaching metal to which we have clear title ???

Talk to the court in Maryland and establish what additional documentation t=
hey
actually require for us to prove beyond doubt that the metal is ours.

Speak to our lawyer and ask 'What should we do next ???'

For the avoidance of doubt no correspondence should be sent
to any of the counterparties unless it has been approved by the
lawyers.Martin Stanley is coordinating our response and should
be appraised of all correspndence,either verbal or written.

Marc Rich/Novarco are some way further down the track in their
similar problem and expect to have their case heard over the next
few days in New jersey.We should keep appraised of their progress.

As regards our stance I think that we should now take steps to hold
the plaintiff responsible for any costs incurred due to the attatchment
and we should ask the court to require the m to post a bond against
such costs.

Any comments welcome

Spoke with Sandra Torres this morning.  She advised me we've had no further
correspondence from the Base Metals attorney, Ely Goldin, and a copy of an
e-mail from you indicates that the material is definitely being seized.  I
told her to speak with our attorney, Art Taylor, to determine what steps he
wants to take next.

I'll be reachable most of the day if you need me.  My home phone numbers ar=
e
516-489-3116 or 516-489-9291.  An overseas call to my private cell phone
would be prohibitively expensive, but Sandy Torres has it if I need to be
reached.

I'd appreciate copies of any e-mails on this subject to this e-mail address=
,
bobbyk0829@aol.com, so I can keep on top of this.  I've also told Sandy to
check with Rukert Terminal to determine when discharge is complete and to
advise you accordingly.

Subject:  M/V Salvador




It's 10:30 PM here and I haven't seen any correspondence relating to the
"Salvador" from anybody.

Martin, I managed to finally get hold of Ely Goldin at about 5 PM.  He said
he was going to e-mail me a copy of a fax he was sending but I never saw it=
.
I told him in no uncertain terms that he was indeed "jamming us up" and tha=
t
if our material wasn't released to us, we'd have to cover our nearby
commitments from other sources at huge cost and would hold Base Metals
responsible.  He said he needed to establish some link between Aluminium of
Siberia and the Russian smelter and he wondered why the shipper on the bill=
s
of lading was Unimetal (or Uni something - I don't quite remember the name)
and what was their relationship to Alum. of Siberia.  I told him we bought =
it
in good faith and there may have been any number of companies in the chain
who were really of no concern to us.  At that point, Art Taylor was calling
him on the other line.  I decided that call was more important so we ended
the conversation.

I trust you have since received an e-mailed update from Sandy as to the
contents of their phone call with Goldin (which someone please e-mail to me=
).

I'll be out of the house all day tomorrow but will have my cell phone with
me, although I expect to be out of range most of the time.  I'll call the
office late morning/early afternoon to get an update.  Sandy, since Art is =
on
vacation, did he suggest that Greg Clausson might be of assistance?  He mig=
ht
be more readily available to file any necessary legal papers, unless he's
also on vacation.

Subject:  002671 - 3,582.548MT ALUMINIUM TEE SHIPPED PER 'SALVADOR' -
      S.PETE/BALTIMORE

Pleased to recap CURRENT situation as follows:

On Friday 7th July, Judge Garbis (District of Maryland) ordered that the
attachment of our metal be vacated (i.e. released), but that ANY proceeds f=
rom
any sales be paid to:

Bank of America,
10 Light Street,
Baltimore,
MD 21202

Account name: Miles and Stockbridge P.C.

Account number: 00 200 382 2806 (Escrow).

We intend to challenge this condition immediately - hopefully Tuesday /
Wednesday (11th / 12th July).

Judge Garbis appears to be on our side, but since this was a 'Friday=20
afternoon'
judgement he has allowed Base Metals a little more time to try and prove we=
=20
were
involved in some 'fraud'.

The Judge told their lawyers that he could see NO indication of any such
evidence and that they had to 'put up or shut up'

 Sorry I was unable to catch up with you on Monday; I tried your office and

 I think we should keep pushing here. I'm inclined to send Ely and company =
a
letter suggesting that they now have enough documentation to show them that
MG does, indeed, own the metal and that they should voluntarily release the
escrow arrangement. I would combine that with a representation that both MG
Corp and MG Ltd are quite solvent and more than able to cover a $5MM loss i=

the extremely unlikely event that Base Metals could ever prove to a court

then I feel we should go back to the court, probably no earlier than Monday
so as not to make it look to Judge Garbis that we are being excessively

 Our easiest argument to the court at this early stage is probably one base=
d
on our solvency, i.e., "Judge there is no need for you to escrow MG's money=
,
because MG is by no means a credit risk by any definition."
 The only other document relating to the metal that I would like to have is
evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?
 I will attempt to send you a draft of the proposed letter to the Bad Guys
later this evening in the hope that we can discuss on Tuesday.

evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?
 I will attempt to send you a draft of the proposed letter to the Bad Guys
later this evening in the hope that we can discuss on Tuesday.

Pleased to recap CURRENT situation as follows:

On Friday 7th July, Judge Garbis (District of Maryland) ordered that the
attachment of our metal be vacated (i.e. released), but that ANY proceeds
from
any sales be paid to:

Bank of America,
10 Light Street,
Baltimore,
MD 21202

Account name: Miles and Stockbridge P.C.

Account number: 00 200 382 2806 (Escrow).

We intend to challenge this condition immediately - hopefully Tuesday /
Wednesday (11th / 12th July).

Judge Garbis appears to be on our side, but since this was a 'Friday
afternoon'
judgement he has allowed Base Metals a little more time to try and prove we
were
involved in some 'fraud'.

The Judge told their lawyers that he could see NO indication of any such
evidence and that they had to 'put up or shut up'

Mark,

Thanks your e-mail and proposed 'draft letter' to Egorov,Pirginsky and
Afanasiev.

We are in agreement to all your suggestions, but would ask your views on th=
e
following:

1) Do you think it would be advisable to return to the court say on this
Thursday, 13th July, and ask Judge Garbis what he considers 'reasonable tim=
e'
for the Plaintiff to react ???

2) We are all determined to keep the pressure on Base and must ensure we ke=
ep
them on the back foot - whilst we agree with the content of your draft we f=
eel
it could be harder hitting - lets discuss.

3) In regard to proof of payment by ALS to Unimetal we have the following
situation - ALS can show they made a number of large payments to Unimetal a=
nd
can supply a spreadsheet showing details of their account with Unimetal. It=
=20
may
be harder to show specific payments against specific invoices, but I am=20
pushing
ALS for such evidence.

4) In your draft letter plse note MG Metal is part of MG plc, a publically
traded company with a market cap of $450.00 million.

Lets discuss on your opening

Martin:
 Sorry I was unable to catch up with you on Monday; I tried your office and
"cell" phone, but called too late in the day.
 I think we should keep pushing here. I'm inclined to send Ely and company =
a
letter suggesting that they now have enough documentation to show them that
MG does, indeed, own the metal and that they should voluntarily release the
escrow arrangement. I would combine that with a representation that both MG
Corp and MG Ltd are quite solvent and more than able to cover a $5MM loss i=
n
the extremely unlikely event that Base Metals could ever prove to a court
that MG owed that amount to them. I would couple this with a request that w=
e
have an all parties conference call no later than Wednesday to discuss our
respective positions. If we can not achieve a result satisfactory to us,
then I feel we should go back to the court, probably no earlier than Monday
so as not to make it look to Judge Garbis that we are being excessively
aggressive.
 Our easiest argument to the court at this early stage is probably one base=
d
on our solvency, i.e., "Judge there is no need for you to escrow MG's money=
,
because MG is by no means a credit risk by any definition."
 The only other document relating to the metal that I would like to have is
evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?
 I will attempt to send you a draft of the proposed letter to the Bad Guys

 Dear Arthur and Martin:
 I received late this evening a rather outrageous letter from Ely Goldin in
which he takes the position that our documents "raise more questions than
they answer." He also indicates that he sees no purpose in having a
conference call unless it is to discuss our responses to his discovery
requests served upon us earlier today, which, incidentally, are completely
void and of no effect under the US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in my
considered judgement.
 I will separately attempt to email to you Goldin's letter, but, in the
event technology fails me, will also fax it to you first thing Friday
morning.
 I believe we should go forward with the conference call among ourselves to
agree upon the next actions on our part. As we suspected, the Base Metal
people are plainly going to be anything but reasonable and, unfortunately,
we will almost certainly be forced to seek our relief from the Court, rathe=
r
than through business like discussions with them.
 I believe you already have dial in instructions for the 10:30 am EDT
conference call. If not, let me know and I'll get them to you.
 I look forward to speaking to you in the am.

Arthur and Martin:
     We've taken a quick look at the papers in the South Carolina case.
It turns out that Base Metal dismissed in that case because they had seized
the wrong metal. As they told the Court: "Upon seizure of the cargo by the
Marshal's service, inspection of the seized cargo and associated transfer
documents, Plaintiff is satisfied that the cargo seized was fabricated at
the Krasnoyarsk Plant, which is not Defendant's plant".

Dear Arthur and Martin:
 Scott Haiber who, as you know, has done virtually all of the brief writing
in this matter, was called about an hour ago and told that, very
unfortunately, his mother fell down the steps while visiting her sister in
London and fractured her neck. Scott and his father are leaving for London
this evening to be with her. We will, obviously, continue to work from this
end on our Court filing, but I wanted to let you know our situation here in
that Scott's absence will slow us down a bit.

Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says
11/23/0 9:44 (New York)


     Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau
raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron
Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity
prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both
companies.
     The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two
companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on
Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both
Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and
denied they had broken any laws.
     Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the
investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the
bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.
     On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy
trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian
power project valued at $136 million.
     Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British
Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

(Globe and Mail, B1, 11/23)
Report on Business: Canadian 
Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing 
sought in Enron , Powerex offices, warrant shows 
LILY NGUYEN AND PETER KENNEDY 
? 
11/23/2000 
The Globe and Mail 
Metro 
Page B1 
All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights 
reserved. 
The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by 
the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price 
fixing by the two companies. 
In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the 
summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of 
electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity 
exchange, Dow Jones reported. 
Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have 
been laid and denied breaking any laws. 
Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based 
Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. 
Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about 
the files. "It remains just allegations," he said. 
"We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the 
Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws." 
Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of 
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their 
companies are still being investigated. 
"Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the 
company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool," Mr. Cousins 
said. 
A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to 
confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the 
bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. 
While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the 
regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. 
Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not 
established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with 
the system, sources said. 
According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two 
companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for 
a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100. 
In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the 
following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most 
expensive unit needed to meet demand. 
Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could 
change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the 
hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from 
June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. 
Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating 
markets. 
"It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's 
happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation 
occur," he said. 
He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever 
there are allegations.

No on #1. Yes on #2. One thing we may want to add in light of #2 is a 
confidentiality agreement so that Jung Ho  doesn't find out about the 
settlement.

		 Subject: Natole


I have spoken with Kirk Fulk for IBC, who has no changes of substance to the
settlement agreement. I also spoke with Tom Deen, who wants to send
revisions after Natole has read the document, which Natole can't do now
because he's travelling. Deen says they will want at least 2 changes of
substance:
1. Natole is asking for an indemnity from Enron and IBC for anyone who
claims through them. I told him this was not something we had talked about
before, and I wasn't sure how Enron would react to it, but my own reaction
was negative because Enron had no claims back against Natole (other than
financial offsets) so I fail to see why it's necessary. IBC is a different
matter because IBC filed a counterclaim against Natole.
2.  Deen wants the Natole indemnity to be capped at the amount of
settlement. In other words, Natole indemnifies Enron & IBC from claims by
Jung Ho (or others) only to the extent of $385,000. This again is not what
we talked about, but as a practical matter I'm not sure how much difference
it makes. Everyone seems to view the likelihood of further claims as remote.
Let me know your thoughts, and I'll forward any further proposals when I get
them.
 Best regards,

 Bill Ogden

.After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: 
senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to 
be independant. We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands. 
There is no "standard" promotion track. If a senior counsel is successful, a 
promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is 
the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. 
There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC.

My trip has been postponed so I will be in the balance of the week.

I would like to secure an affadavit(s) from payroll (stating he was not our 
employee) and human resources (stating no employment file exists for this 
gentlemen and that no employee benefits were offered/paid to him).  Is this 
something that you can assist me in obtaining or would you prefer I work with 
our Litigation Unit in order to obtain? 

In the meantime, I am writing back to the attorney requesting the Wyoming 
cases he is relying upon.  Also, I am going to request his clients damages as 
a result of this incident and a copy of their commercial auto policy.  Thanks,

Rob

Kathy: 

I notice that a number of parties to one or more of the NSM cases have 
jointly entered into an agreement with Esquire Reporting concerning 
deposition reporting.

Just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to confirm that ECT Securities was 
not consulted with respect to this agreement and is not a party to it.? In 
the event that we notice our own depositions, we will use Esquire as a 
convenience to the other parties.? We will make our own arrangements with 
Equire to obtain copies of transcripts of depositions noticed by others.

Thanks. 

See you in Fort Wayne.

Hi Richard.  We are close to finalizing a sale of our Pastoria project in 
California to Calpine.  I've got you listed as a "knowledge" party of ENA for 
purposes of making a rep regarding litigation.  Could you please take a look 
at Section 4.1(i) of the attached draft, and let me know if there are any 
actions required to be scheduled for the rep to be accurate.  At this point, 
my proposed Schedule 4.1(i) says "none", and, hopefully, that statement is 
still accurate.  We're on a timetable that requires me to ask for your 
response by the end of theday tomorrow (Thursday).  Thanks. --  kj

be dissolved, but I don't want to respond to Pam without your feedback.

Steve,

I am currently working on the SAP project, and need to know if the following 
ENA legal entities can be dissolved, or if there is a legal reason to keep 
them around.  Deb Korkmas mentioned that you may be able to help me with 
these.

18 Intratex Gas, Co.
51 Panhandle Gas Co.
54 Enron Industrial Natural Gas, Co.
58 Houston Pipe Line Marketing, Co.
72 Enron Texoma Gas Co.
446 Enron Administrative Services, Corp.

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss.  If there is a legal 
reason to keep these entities, we need to get them set up in SAP as soon as 
possible.

Thank you,
Pam

We left at 10:30 and went to Kenneally's Irish Pub to get something to eat( 
they ran out of food at the gala) I did bid on a piece of art, but I don't 
know if I won. I doubt it, it was a popular item.

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

		 Subject: Defense Group Internet Site


I am writing for your approval to enter into an agreement on behalf of Enron
and the Enron outside counsel to enable all of us to have access to the
joint work product website for the Gordon Hendricks group.  The Website will
have the following information:

Event Calendar
Docket and pleadings for Electricity Litigation around the West
Pleadings in the major cases we are all in
Repository for all working drafts of documents
Repository for letters that are now circulated as attachments

In the future, some defendants may use this system for actual document
productions to government agencies etc.

As I see it, we really have not choice but to join this system if we are
going to participate in the joint defense group.  Shortly they will stop
circulating work product etc. via email and will rely upon this website
instead.

The costs are somewhat unclear but it is intended to be an economy of scale
cost sharing concept.

They cannot start the program until we all sign up and so they are asking
for a quick response.

Thanks
Gary

		 Subject: FW: Draft Responses to Chairman Hoecker's Questions


FYI.
Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still
missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I
believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.
He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.
Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate
the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get
it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal
court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our
preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to
preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be
difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one
chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the
finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the
likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether
it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit
analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  "if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs."

 Talk to you tomorrow.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Draft Responses to Chairman Hoecker's Questions


As you will see, the attached draft incorporates Sue's and Mary's drafts as
well as additional text from me.  The comments filed on Nov. 22 are
literally one foot high. If the Commission is serious about getting an order
out by mid-December, it is thus highly unlikely that it will carefully
review any of the Comments other than the major players (CPUC, Gov. Davis,
the UDCs).  I do believe, however, that Chairman Hoecker, the Commissioners
and the high level Staffers will be more likely to review the responses to
Hoecker's questions.  Thus, if we are to have any realistic hope that they
will focus on our arguments, I thought it advisable to use these responses
as an advocacy piece rather than a mere discovery response.  Hence, I
suggest a lengthy rather than minimalist response.

I thought that Gary's concern in an earlier email about Alan's rebuttal to
the J&K piece was well taken.  I have thus taken out all references to a
need to do more analysis on the market abuse issue, and recast his write-up
as simply a rebuttal of the J&K Study.

Finally, the draft (which I have included in Word and WP formats/ the WP
format may paginate more accurately) is no doubt in need of wordsmithing;
any suggestions would be well appreciated.

I would like to file this tomorrow, so please call or email me as early in
the morning as possible.  (I am not sending this email from my computer, so
please create a new email to me when you respond rather than simply hit the
"reply" button to this email.)  Talk to you tomorrow (Friday).

Ron

Just to notify you that we have a dispute with the above company regarding 
purchase from Globoil of gas condensate. The issue in dispute is a point of 
construction of the agreement. The amount in dispute is around USD500,000. 
Michael has agreed that we use Linklaters as the litigation lawyers; Globoil 
is using Herbert Smith. tks

Attached please find the revised summary for Antara.  Please delete the 
previous file you received and replace with this version.

Pricing has the biggest impact on valuation from where we were 6 months ago, 
as depicted in the operations cash flow section for the Gulf Coast.

As discussed, risk factors are estimates and are subjective.

The Proved Undeveloped (PUD) reserves in the Rockies are based on the 
Netherland and Sewell (NSA) 1/1/99 reserve report and do not reflect what 
Enron thought 6 months ago.  Our in-house estimates of the PUD reserves are 
50-75% of NSA and would indicate a current unrisked value for the PUDs of 
perhaps $4-5 million.  However, a potential acquirer may just use the NSA 
numbers and risk adjust as I have done in the spreadsheet.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jim Ledlow

		 Subject: Playoff Tickets


I received an invoice this week from the Rockets for playoff tickets. We
need to make payment for the first two rounds by March 30 and decide whether
any credit should be refunded or applied to next year's tickets. The cost
for the first two rounds (which assumes 6 games) is $2,944. This calculation
is based on $944 for Round 1 (2 games with no home court advantage) and
$2000 for Round 2 (4 games assuming home court advantage). Based upon the
existing split, I need to collect the following amounts from each of you by
March 30:
Gage (25%): $736
Roten (25%): $736
Ballard (12.5%): $368
Doherty (12.5%): $368
Sanders (12.5%): $368
Eggleston (12.5%): $368
I suggest that any credit for unplayed games be applied to next year's
tickets. If anyone does not want playoff tickets or wants to opt out of next
year's tickets, let me know as soon as possible so I can make other
arrangements. Anyone not buying playoff tickets for the first two rounds
will not be entitled to buy tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 in the unlikely event
that the Rockets survive. By the way, tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 will cost
$4,976! Call me at 713/659-5100 with any questions. Max

Bob,

Currently, the Litigation Unit is providing advice and counsel.  At the 
suggestion of Richard Sanders, Grant Harvey of Gibbs & Bruns will be 
attending the meeting scheduled for Friday between ExxonMobil and Enron, 
given his representation of ENA in a suit with KN over the Bushton plant.  No 
decision as to outside counsel, however, has yet been made.  Bob Vote recalls 
hearing that Richard Sanders has advised Jim Derrick of this matter, and one 
of us will provide a short voice-mail report of the Friday meeting to Jim 
afterwards.

Let us know if we can answer any further questions.

Britt

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the "non-walkers")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

I left Twanda several messages last week about trying to schedule a conference
call to start the settlement discussions in the PCA case.  I know that last
message was to her direct voice mail, but the earlier ones may have been to a
wrong number (number dialed:  713-853-9042).  Sorry if they didn't get through
to her.

Nonetheless, the Trustee and counsel are available for a conference call on
Thursday, Oct. 26th in the morning after 10:30 CST and up until 2:00 pm.  Do 
you
have any time on Thursday.  I know it is late notice, but if you do, then I'd
say let's get the ball rolling.

I am available on Wednesday to sit down and review the issues, numbers, etc. 
in
preparation of such a call.  If we go forward on Thursday, let me know what
works for you on Wednesday.  Thanks.

I'm in the office Monday morning, but will be traveling on Monday afternoon 
and
am out on Tuesday in a deposition.  Thanks.

One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in 
a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG 
contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million. As you will recall, this 
representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we 
were in CA last month.

Jim - Happy New Year!  While I am no longer on the legal side of the fence, I 
want to pass on to you my strong recommendation for you to consider using 
O'Melveny & Myers, in particular for California litigation,  but perhaps in 
other areas.  Over the past 2 years, we used O'Melveny in connection with the 
wind cos dispute with Florida Power & Light, and they did a great job.  
O'Melveny is one of the 2 or 3 largest firms in California and probably one 
of its oldest and finest.  One of their litigation partners (and good 
personal friend of mine) is named Brian Curry, and if you have any interest 
in meeting these guys, they would very much like the chance to meet you.  
Please let me know if there might be any interest.  I hope all is well with 
you and your family.  Best regards. Adam

I am sorry I am so late in getting back to you. It has been a rough week. It 
looks like SoCal Ed. and PG&E are really going to file for bankruptcy. We 
have been working around the clock to review all our contracts with them and 
attempt to minimize the damage. I will call you tomorrow to talk about how to

>It's 8:20pm right now and it sound like there is a bad storm outside
or a disturbance that the law would be summons to and if this was a party
making that much noise there would be people in jail for it but good grief
that noise that the power plant makes would wake the dead and that is the
truth and yes i would like to get away from this but we dont like much
paying for our home but no one would dare buy it.

I have lived here for 3 peaceful years and every one said how beautiful and
peaceful it was and now they are glad they dont live here and that is sad

Richard:  I must admit I feel like a real pain in the ___ since I know how 
much stuff you have going on, but I wanted to see if we could set up a call 
with you with some of our folks working on the Infineum lawsuit so that we 
are in a position to file responsive papers in the case shortly.  As we 
initially discussed, the factual situation relating to East Coast's history 
of dealings with Infineum (formerly Exxon) is incredibly complex as are the 
various contractual and other documents.  Jon Mostel, our principal 
transactions lawyer who has been working for more than a year with East Coast 
Power on the contract with Tosco (i.e., Bayway Refining Company), has been 
instrumental in providing the factual, legal and regulatory predicates for 
the East Coast deal and how Infineum fits into or is affected by that.  We 
have given significant thought over the past few weeks to the underlying 
issues in the case, the relevant precedent as well as the likely strategic 
moves at this point, taking into account the particular federal judge 
assigned to the case.  We would like to walk through our thought process with 
you to obtain your input on the case strategy at this point, particularly if 
Enron has a general policy or pre-disposition on the litigation side to go 
one way or the other from a procedural standpoint subject, of course, to the 
specific facts present in the case.  Could you let me know if there may be a 
convenient  time when you could speak with us.  You could call me or Steve 
Levitsky (212) 424-8309, one of my litigator colleagues here in New York who 
is assisting Stuart in preparing the case.  As I noted in my v-mails, Stuart 
recently has been involved in an ongoing trial in Federal Court in New Jersey 
and Steve has been taking the laboring oar on the necessary research and 
factual investigation and is fully familiar with the case.  Hopefully, we 
could do it before next Wednesday, but if it would be of any help I will be 
in your offices next Wednesday and with a little juggling I could probably 
visit you in your office sometime in the a.m. or afternoon and then plug our 
litigators in by phone.  Perhaps you could reply to this and let me know what 
might work for you.  Thanks.  I hope that you have a good holiday weekend.  
John

Dear Doug,

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

Thanks. Frankly, at this point, it is anyone's guess how this will develop. 
Given your distance to Spokane, Is there a local counsel that you would 
recommend---one with good ties to Jugde Whaley.

Maybe it goes without saying, but to dispel any doubt:  if the class action
suit that we discussed yesterday remains in front of Judge Whaley, and if he
handles the case out of Spokane, and if you decide that it makes sense to
retain co-counsel from Washington (a lot of if's, I know), I hope you will
consider our firm, and more specifically our office here in Seattle.  I have
defended numerous class action suits over the years, including, on behalf of
Northwest Airlines, a claim of price-fixing among major air carriers in the
setting of travel agent commissions.  As I mentioned, I also have some
knowledge about the roots and consequences of the current power crisis on
the West Coast, and I have some experience with Judge Whaley as well.  A
detailed personal resume along with a list of recent cases I have handled is
available on the firm's website (www.susmangodfrey.com).

Whether it ultimately makes sense for Enron to retain us in this case or
not, don't hesitate to call again if there is any other way I can be
helpful.

I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate 
Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing 
with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because 
we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be 
brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are 
about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various 
Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those 
was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that 
issue.  Someone please advise me or Jim Bouillion what this is about.

We are tangled up with all our regular clients, including SCE banks, SCE

Enron without running afoul of other existing representations.? We appreciate 
your inquiry about our availability as we always enjoy working with you, but 
we do not want to hang you up because of our other directly related client 
engagements.? As I said last night, Ralph Maybe is a good choice, the others 
you mentioned not anywhere near as good.? There are also two other very high 
quality lawyer suggestions I? would make, and I would be happy to facilitate 
and introduction if you desire, although the firms are insolvency boutiques,? 
they are Howard Weg and Ken Klee both here in LA.? Call me when you get a 
chance.

Not only no, but hell no.  Once burned (badly), twice shy (exponentially).  
The best and only development on NSM I would like to see is to get out the 
litigation morass and (hopefully) be a little wiser next time.

Seriously, if the project does get reorganized (sans Enron additional 
investment), what does that mean in terms of any potential recovery for the 
existing debt?  Presumably any reorganization would come out of a bankruptcy 
plan.  Any hope?

Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person
concerning a possible investment by Enron in some reorganized form of the
project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
so, who?

We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
first.

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 
20, 2001 
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 


Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing 
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's 
firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more 
aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she 
objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to 
withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her 
aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what 
Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, 
she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are 
doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the 
Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help.

Richard--

We have agreed to depose Ron Natole on Feb. 18 at 10 a.m., at his lawyer's 
office.  I will copy you on the amended notice we are sending out today.

We have not rescinded our depo notices for the 2 Korean gentlemen, but have 
agreed to reset the dates.  I expect Plaintiff's counsel will de-designate 
these men rather than bring them here for their depos.  The only other notice 
we sent out last week was for the designated expert from the Wood Group -- 
Robert Harrison.  I will attempt to obtain available dates directly from him.

With respect to the depos of Enron personnel, please check with Mike Miller 
and Bob Virgo regarding their availability during the 2 weeks we discussed -- 
Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 -- March 3.  Of course, we will also need a block of time 
in advance of the depos to prepare with the witnesses.  Bill has a trial 
setting the 2nd week (Feb. 28), which may be postponed in the near future.  
If it is not, I can present them for their depos.  Plaintiff's counsel has 
not mentioned any other Enron personnel by name, but has generally requested 
dates for anyone else we may be presenting at trial as a fact witness or 
corporate rep.

The only other name that I recall having potentially significant involvement 
was Dave Marshall, an ECT risk management guy who appears to have had some 
discussions with IBC's Ron Anderson about Enron's requirements with respect 
to repaired/refurbished parts.  Bill believes there may be other Enron 
witnesses, and that Miller and Virgo will know who they are.

We are also working up a list of proposed mediators -- preferably with strong 
commercial litigation experience.  Gary McGowan currently heads the list, but 
I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have.

Lastly, I agree with your suggestion regarding our question as to why the 
Wood Group (Robert Harrision) has appeared on Plaintiff's expert list.  It 
would certainly be helpful to have Miller's thoughts on that subject.

<!--TEXT-->

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a
reward of more than $50 million to anyone who has information that will help 
his
office prosecute power suppliers accused of gouging the wholesale electricity
market in the state.

Lockyer's Energy Emergency Task Force has been conducting an investigation for
several months into allegations that generators and natural gas marketers have
engaged in "any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction in the
California (electricity) supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or
electricity."

"My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy
providers have violated any laws," Lockyer said. "It is possible that one or
more members of the public can help with information, and if so, the financial
reward to such a person or persons could be enormous."

Gov. Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer's office can
investigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and other
anticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.

Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) have
vehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale 
electricity
market has already been investigated by federal regulators and various state
agencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate any
antitrust laws.

Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of the
state's electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companies
overcharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and 
early
2001.

Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand 
in
the state and the high price of natural gas.

The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generators
to refund the money to the state's utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generators
the benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate their
electricity prices or refund the money.

Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to a
spokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.

"Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a
false claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award," Lockyer
said. "Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant
could potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of 
dollars."

Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as "greedy 
profiteers"
and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place a
windfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state's
wholesale market.

Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for "greedy business
decisions of generators, marketers and utilities" adding that he will seek
criminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gouged
the wholesale electricity market.

"Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the
expense of California pay back what they owe."

What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core 
performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in 
no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on 
to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose 
at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your 
and Gary's thoughts.

		 Subject: AAA Arbitration


We should discuss Tuesday what our current goal is in the AAA arbitration we 
filed.  (An administrative conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, 
February 21, at noon PST.)

>From our perspective, it would make sense to put the arbitration on hold 
pending FERC's ruling on the charge-backs.  (Based on a conversation with 
counsel this afternoon, the PX is perfectly willing to do this.)  If FERC 
ultimately rules against us, the PX would be able to assert a set-off that 
would wipe out the claim in the arbitration.  If FERC disapproves the 
charge-backs, it may be possible to resolve the excess collateral issue.

Let's discuss on Tuesday whether you agree, or whether there are reasons for 
active pursuit of the arbitration.

you don't want to give Richard any reason to transfer it to you (or to me).

John - I knew that this was tickling my memory and suddenly I remembered!  
Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of 
liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same 
entity to which you refer).  

By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened 
to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how 
can we get copies of the liquidation evidence.

Hi, Kate. It surely can wait that long. 

By the wasy, we have another company that somehow has been allocated to us, 
Enron Gas Liquids, a French Company, that EECC was surprised to find it owns 
and has no use for, so we would like to liquidate it as well. Is that 
something your gang would handle as well, just to make sure that no other 
Enron entity needs it?

Veronica,

I spoke with Pittsburgh Corning about our current month natural gas 
receivables. Per Harry Fleming, they have filed Chapter 11 and are in court. 
He transferred me to Jill Kio who informed me that they submitted Enron's 
invoice for payment before they filed so they do not expect to delay payment. 
However, as they do not know what the outcome of court will be, they can not 
promise the payment will NOT be delayed.

Jill is faxing me some paperwork on their filings and I will forward that to 
you upon receipt. If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to call.

Subject: Documentation retention and Email

Hello Robert and Rob,

I thought I would respond to a few of the issues which were raised in 
Robert's email of March 23rd regarding the email retention policy. 
The overall policy which seems to be now agreed to for European emails 
appears below.  

INBOX- Deletion after 30 days
SENT deleted after 30 days- ( now confirmed that once in folder, it will not 
be deleted s.t comments below)
TRASH- 15 days( same as policy )
FOLDERS- moved to archives/ livelink via OUTLOOK after 365 days after being 
in folder
ARCHIVES 6 years (livelink or Ivault)

However while the above time limits have been 'agreed', IT have also been 
developing project OMNI which as I understand it will replace Lotus Notes 
with Outlook.  The implementation of Outlook, involves limiting the amount of 
email stored ( both in your inbox and the folders) to 100Mb before it is 
removed from the folder or inbox and over into an archiving system 
(hopefully). This technical limitation (100Mb) may or may not clash with the 
day limitations we have proposed above, depending on the amount of emails one 
receives and the type of attachments which are in the emails themselves. The 
ultimate interaction between the technical parameters (100Mb) together with 
the time limitations (number of days) will have to be worked out. 

With respect to the issue of recycling and back up tapes, once we have a 
reliable archive system in place we can move to eliminate the back up tapes 
for received emails and recycle them in a similar fashion to Houston. However 
it should be noted that whatever archive system we decide to use, whether it 
be livelink, Ivault or some other system, we will also have some sort of back 
up system for the archive whether it be tapes or through some other type of 
mechanism.

I have spoken with a few of the IT people on our end and we will be having 
meetings to ensure that we are all of the same mind when it comes to the 
implementation of this policy. Hopefully this addresses a few of the concerns 
which were expressed. If anyone has any further comments, concerns or 
questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me at 0207 783 4084.

Kind Regards,

Ian Brungs

This will acknowledge receipt of the above.  This will be handled as an 
insurance-related matter, subject to any objections by our reinsurer, to 
which we would not anticipate.  The allegations give rise to a "products" 
claim, and as such, pollution related exclusionary language would not be 
applicable.  Thus, we will defend the entire lawsuit, and indemnify with the 
exception of any settlement/award for damages associated with the count of 
"FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT" as such constitutes "intentional" conduct as opposed 
to an "accident".  I trust you will advise the operating company accordingly.

Eileen, please advise as to who you suggest we retain in this matter.  
Perhaps other firms have been retained by the other defendants to which we 
could share in a cost-sharing agreement.  Additionally, it is critical for us 
to determine our involvement and any sale dates of product given that the 
lawsuit is silent as to the time period involved here. The involved time 
period will have an impact on how claim payments will be allocated.

Thanks,

Rob

Enron Metals is considering filing a breach of contract arbitration 
proceeding against Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America.

If you are aware of any reason that Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America 
should not be sued, please call me at 713-345-7105 or e-mail me by the end of 
business on Monday, March 26, 2001.  If I do not hear from you by then, I 
will assume that you have no objection to Enron Metals instituting this 
litigation.

Thanks for your assistance.

		 Subject: Dispute Resolution in Colombia Trading Contracts

Jim,

As you know, Jeff Skilling has approved opening a trading operation in 
Columbia.   The company's open position at any one time will be no more than 
$500,000.  Jeff Hodge and Francisco Pinto-Leite have been working  on the 
trading contracts.  Our businesspeople inform us that they will not be able 
to obtain counterparties' agreement to international arbitration.  We, for 
our part, are unwilling to agree to refer all disputes to the Colombia 
courts.  The best option appears to be arbitration conducted under the 
auspices of the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.  We have obtained a written 
opinion from local counsel, Figueroa Sierra & Asociados, opining that this 
body has a proven record of conducting arbitrations fairly, without bias, and 
free from corruption.  In particular, foreign parties have been treated 
without discrimination, winning their fair share of awards.  We are 
requesting that we be permitted to accept the Bogota Chamber of Commerce as 
the exclusive forum for resolving any disputes that might arise under our 
trading contracts.   I am aware that we have accepted local arbitration for 
trading disputes in Buenos Aries; I am not sure whether we have done so in 
Europe.

Please let me know if this is acceptable to you, or if would like additional 
information.    

Thank you.

I understand we'll be meeting next week.  I figured one of the first things

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

As we have discussed, for the personal jurisdiction and other Rule 12
motions, we would like to prove a negative and show that none of the Enron
companies has had any contacts or relationships with any of the named
plaintiffs.

There is now posted on the Kansas extranet a Dwight's printout showing the
wells / leases in Kansas for which Quinque Operating Company is the
operator.  You might have someone at Northern examine this list and see if
the well, lease, field, and reservoir names trigger any thoughts about
whether Northern has any connection or relationship with Quinque.  Thanks.

If you have any trouble getting it downloaded from the extranet, I can fax
the list to you.

Richard:

I've arranged for both Judge Lacey and Stu Alderoty (both from our Newark, NJ 
office) to join us for lunch on September 27th when you are in New York.  
I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working 
on the Infineum case, can attend as well.  Based on your planned arrival into 
LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:00/1:15 
p.m. range.  I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 
W. 55th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)--19th Floor.  
If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
know.

On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
to facilitate anything for you in that respect.

I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
well.

Best regards.

John

Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
place.

Sempra is the parent of Southern Cal. Gas. It has no relation to So Cal 
Edison.

Is the same Sempra that is SoCal Edison's parent?  Should we work this claim 
(my understanding is that Sempra claims EWS owes it over $150 million) into 
our dealings with SoCal Edison in California?

I am a Sr. Legal Specialist currently with CALME- Enron Caribbean Basin Legal 
Group (I report to Frank Sayre) and due to the circumstances affecting this

other day and she suggested that I send you my C.V.  Thus, I enclose a copy 
of my C.V. and List of Accomplishments with Enron for your review and 
consideration.  I believe that Frank Sayre has been having some discussions

Personal and Confidential
Privileged Solicitor and Client Communication

As many of you know, I met with Chris Calger yesterday in Portland.  I
will be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which I
will ask him to review for distribution.  In summary, Chris was frank
and open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with the
investigation.  I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did not
have direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular trade
during the period being investigated by the government.  Although, in my
view, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken in
connection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself as
spearheading or orchestrating that process.  I hope to prepare my memo
today for review by Chris later in the day.

PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver to
represent their interest.  The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a senior
member of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.  His practice focuses on regulatory
law and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry.

I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him a
very general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgary
office.  He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in the
PowerX office in Vancouver.  Their investigation started at the same
time as ours and ended on Thursday of last week.

Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations with
Enron involving these various trades.  As a result, I suspect that these
tapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes.
 I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may be
contained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized by
the government.  I did get the impression, however, that the government
has taken possession of tapes from PowerX.

He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves are
not the concern but the tapes are.  Again, I did not discuss any
particular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keep
taped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders.

I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I,
and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.  He is open to
entertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters of
privilege and commonality of interest.

He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review the
evidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet and
preferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by the
government before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialogue
with us to see what information might be worth sharing.

I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when we
might meet with him.  We might want to discuss briefly during our
telephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with Lawson
Lundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so.

Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for John
Lavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues.
Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him and
had to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.  Cliff did meet with John
Lavorato for approximately two hours last night.  Cliff called me this
morning and would like to meet with me.  I will meet him at 4:00 today.
Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imagined
and expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades and
nothing else.  I will report to you further on this after I have had a
chance to meet with Cliff O*Brien.

If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.  In any
event, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference call
Friday at 10:30 (central time).

Regards,

Dan

		 Subject: Bad Faith Claims/Stricltly Privileged & Confidential

In the international arbitration between United India and DPC, United India 
seeks to have the parties realigned and force DPC to be the claimant, even 
though United India invoked arbitration.  We'd rather United India remain the 
claimant because we think they will have a difficult time carrying their 
burden. We are fighting this issue in the first hearing to be held before the 
arbitrators in London on Feb.15.  One of the bases on which United India 
relies, albeit weak, is that it commenced arbitration to avoid a suit in 
Texas courts, and that in consulting Texas lawyers, they learned 
"coincidentally" that these lawyers were "defending 3 sets of  bad faith 
proceedings brought by Enron in the face of binding arbitration 
agreements."   That was in November  2000.  I've called everyone I think 
would know, and as far as I can tell,  this is not true.  We are about to 
file an affidavit stating so in the case.  Please confirm (again if I have 
already contacted you) that you know of no bad faith claims of any kind  (not 
necessarily just in the insurance context) brought by Enron against anyone 
that is currently pending or was pending at that time.  We do not know who 
the lawyers they claimed to have consulted were.  Please advise me if there 
is someone else I should ask.
Thanks for your help!
Kind regards,
Michelle

Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Subject: Vibration Complaints at Gleason

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Peter

Derrick can do it.  Could you please give me some more dates?

You will receive this service of process today. I have already spoken with 
Sam Gaufin, Crown Energy's counsel, re the subpoena served on us by MCNIC.  
ENA holds preferred stock in Crown Energy, but, as I understand from talking 
with Dan Lyons, we don't consider it to really have any value.  In any event, 
I will make sure that Sam knows what we are producing before it is produced, 
and I have made arrangements for a protective order with respect to any Enron 
confidential information (although thus far I have seen only a little that 
would fall into that category).  Let me know if you have any 
questions/comments.

Richard, in the future, could you please have your Assistant forward the 
reports to me.  Previously, Mr. Derrick did not have e-mail and his mail was 
diverted to me automatically by the system.  Now, it does go to him and I 
have to go in and send it back to me.  Mr. Derrick reads the reports after I 
take care of the administration of them which involves copying, filing and 
forwarding on to Vinson & Elkins.  This is the procedure he has set for me.  

I don't mean to complicate your life further, but would really appreciate it 
if you could do this.  

Thanks so much,

Steph.

Veronica,

I spoke with Pittsburgh Corning about our current month natural gas 
receivables. Per Harry Fleming, they have filed Chapter 11 and are in court. 
He transferred me to Jill Kio who informed me that they submitted Enron's 
invoice for payment before they filed so they do not expect to delay payment. 
However, as they do not know what the outcome of court will be, they can not 
promise the payment will NOT be delayed.

Jill is faxing me some paperwork on their filings and I will forward that to 
you upon receipt. If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to call.

Christian,

EPMI owes the PX a payment of approximately $25k this Friday for real-time 
charges for December.  It's the true-up payment (volume management calls it 
the "final" invoice).

Query:  Should we advise the PX to take the payment out of EPMI's collateral, 
like we did last time?  I told Brett "yes," subject to check with you.

Brett will wait to hear from you or me before he advises Houston.

Thanks,

Steve

Squires is not going to recuse himself. However,he was not the judge who 
heard the prel. hearing. An associate judge--Brent Burg-- heard the prelim. 
hearing

before I go asking around, it would be helpful to know what judge it is.

squires is wonderful.  judge probably sustained b/c objections were good.
he would be my first choice.

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don
Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is
much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary
hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he
has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my
mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty
pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my
lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone
that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres,
and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
Thanks for your help.

Richard,
  I am writing to request a conflict waiver so that one of my partners Fred
Holden can represent JEA, a water sewer and electrical utility located in
Jacksonville, Florida I connection with the pending PGE bankruptcy.  This
representation would be uder the same terms as the City of Palo Alto.  JEA
agrees we will not repesent them against Enron, they do not believe they
have claims against Enron and if JEA becomes adverse to Enron they agree we
ca represent Enron against them.

Thanks
Gary

Mark & Richard:  Since I have the benefit of reading the WSJ on my commute 
into the City, I thought I would just let you know if you had not see it 
already that there is a follow up article today to yesterday's article about 
the tremendous losses being absorbed by PG&E and SoCalEd due to the spike in 
wholesale power prices.  The article today, not surprisingly, talks about the 
significant 3Q earnings that are anticipated to be reported by the 
unregulated generating companies (E.g., Reliant, NRG and Southern) that 
purchased the plants from PG&E and SoCalEd.  While this "news" is not 
unexpected, it nonetheless is the type of article that tends to excite 
consumer advocates, politicians and regulators since it focuses on what it 
calls the "irony" of the utilities now suffering huge losses (which 
ultimately will be borne by consumers to some, and perhaps a large, extent) 
from having to buy power from assets they once owned.  Obviously, the concern 
is that the rhetoric overtakes a rational examination of the system.  I know 
that each of you are following this situation very closely, but I thought I 
would just drop you a quick note in any event.  John

		 Subject: Project Stanley - Blakes Account

Got your voice mail.  My thoughts are the following:

1.  I always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name, 
hourly rate and task description.  If it is not in this account I do not know 
why and I think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it.

2.  I would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number 
of people involved.  I lost involvement (at the direction of Delainey and 
Milnthorp) early in this project after the initial crisis management stage, 
but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the 
following:  

At the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related 
technical and legal issues in the short term.  Over the longer term, staffing 
requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original 
crisis management stage the file has been over staffed.  At the same time, in 
fairness, I believe Blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements 
of Enron to throw al ot of resources at the project.  If it has not already 
happened, I believe you should speak to Dan Fournier to confirm our 
expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources.  As I say, I was asked 
to step back from this project, but I am happy to have this discussion with 
Dan Fournier if you prefer.

Also, I did not receive a copy of the account, but it seems to me that at our 
direction Blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which 
will also be greatly expensive and which will as I understand be billed to 
Blakes and included in Blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain 
privilege.  If it has not already happened, I also believe the use of the 
consultants also needs to be rationalized.

I also expect that VE will have a not insignificant account.

In summary, since the initial stage I have had limited involvement, but I am 
not surprised (and would have expected) that the account is large and I 
expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll 
in.  I believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that 
the use of all consultants including Blakes needs to be rationalized.  I also 
believe that Blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of 
them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources 
to the project.

Lastly, in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be 
a number of people involved, Rob Milnthorp initially spoke to John Lavorato 
about setting up a separate Houston RC for the project which John agreed to.  
The RC number I gave you may have been a Canadian RC and I need to confirm 
with accounting.  In any event, I will be sending a subsequent e-mail to all 
internal groups to make sure that all expenses, internal and external, are 
billed to that separate RC.

Peter.

Please let me know if I can be of any help.

Gary---I think you should write the PX a letter asking:1) where this $ went, 
2) whether the Core performance bond has been paid and where that $ went,3) 
whether the State has paid them any $ for the block forward positions, 4) has 
a claim been made on the CTS performance bond and is it still active given 
the State's action, 5)How did they calculate the $17mm chargeback they sent 
us, 6)what other $ has been collected to minimize the chargebacks
If anyone has anything else they think we should ask the PX please send Gary 
and me a note.

Just a reminder:  The ISO held a Firm Transmission Right ("FTR") auction last 
month that netted the California IOUs $80 million.  That money is credited to 
their account to reduce their revenue requirement for access charges (it 
reduces the amount of money that the utilities' ratepayers pay for 
transmission access charges).

As creditors, we should have some claim against that money.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Richard-

I just wanted to follow up on my requests attached below.  Additionally, we 
haven't received a response from Gibbs & Bruns.  This isn't a problem right 
now as we are still probably at least a week away from signing an opinion.  I 
just wanted to keep you informed.  Let me know if I can send someone up to 
get copies of the documents.  Thanks for your help.

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.
/ / /
  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;

Jim,

I just tried to call you.  I wanted to get the attached to you before next
week.

Presently, Enron on behalf of Doyle has filed a claim for $6,212,577.54 in
Property Damage as a result of the mechanical failure on 6/14/00.  The
attached 40+ page spread sheet details Factory Mutual's review of the
covered claim with adjustments for overscope or overstatement of repair and
Exclusion E (Defective material, design, workmanship) of the General
Exclusions in the policy issued to Doyle.  The review is based on
information obtained or documentation submitted to date.  All adjustments
are subject to further discussion and submission of documentation, therefore
the adjustments should be considered estimates.  Scope adjustments are
$3,488,310.58; Exclusion E adjustments are $437,865.67, resulting in an
estimated measured claim of $2,286,401.29.

Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss the adjustments in detail
in Houston after next week (I have confirmed that as a group, the four of us
that came down for the last meeting cannot arrange).

Claude

Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to 
coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for 
several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of 
it. Do you think that if I went to Cleveland and talked to Schultes, perhaps 
with a business person, that we could get out?

Does enron have counsel yet in Cleveland?  Counsel for the other defendants
there are anxious to coordinate with Enron''s lawyer once selected.

		 Subject: Grynberg/Quinque

 Charlie Tetrault called me today to make sure we were aware of one more 
billing issue arising out of the above-referenced cases.  A little chronology 
may help.

 Until around October or November of last year, V&E's bills solely referenced 
the Grynberg II case.  Afterwards, due to Northern having removed the case, 
V&E's bills included a seperate category for Quinque time.  Starting in 
January of 2000, however, V&E's bills (the first one being for December time) 
introduced a third category for  "Joint Defense Work" time.  This third 
classification represented work done by V&E on the proposed Quinque motion to 
dismiss for lack of standing, etc.(but not for lack of personal jurisdiction, 
which briefing is being done by Fulbright).  Basically, V&E, Skadden and one 
other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of 
standing, etc.  Substantially all that work has already been done, according 
to Charlie.  The expectation was that, e.g., Enron would pay V&E's fees up 
front, Sonat would pay Skadden's bills up front, etc., then all those who 
"fronted" such fees would recover those payments from other members of the 
joint defense committee, who would be billed pro rata.

 What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50% of the Joint 
Defense Work time category, then the Holland & Hart trustee who eventually 
makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity 
in determining how the reimbursements will be made.  Charlie really left it 
up to us as to what we want to do; we just need to make sure that everyone 
(including, I guess, Holland & Hart) understands that EOG will be one of the 
ones "fronting" the money to V&E and entitled to receive reimbursement.  One 
the other hand, I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if 
Enron paid 100% of the Joint Defense Billing (and accordingly got 100% of any 
reimbursement), so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated

 Frankly, I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50/50 
split after he sees these most recent bills, given that the Jont Defense 
Billing is exclusively for Quinque work.  

 My thought is not to change how we pay the 50/50 split on the bills we have 
already received, but advise V&E that for future bills, they can bill Enron 
100% of the Joint Defense Billing category.

 Please let me know how you all feel about this.

        B.K.D.

As discussed, attached are materials gathered in-house as to ERCOT Summer

product prices for each trading day of the summer, as published in MegaWatt 
Daily, and (ii) articles from the Megawatt Daily indicating unusual price 
movements in the same period.  Our "InfoCentral" employee has indicated as to 
the latter that articles published on August 2, 3, 16, 17 and 19, 1999 made 
reference to "next summer", and may thus on their face be indicative of 
altered forward price curves.  Please contact me with any questions or

The deposition will not take place. I talked to the litigation manager at WM 
about settlement today. We are going to talk again Monday.

If it's not deferred, who's gonna pay for Ecogas employees being deposed to 
go to Oakland?  Ecogas doesn't have any money!

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Just a follow up on the voicemail I left this morning.

I hope you will be able to (1) get Kevin McConville to come to Los Angeles
this week to meet fo a long factual meeting, (2) get us a telephonic interview
with Donna Lawry (sp?), and (3) locate the report on Kuhn Sawasdi done by the
Internal Security Department at Enron (probably in 1997 or early 1998).

Richard,

You reviewed a letter from CMS a couple of weeks ago.  The company's senior 
management called me to ask what we saw that made us turn down the 
transaction.  I told them that I could not get specific because of the 
threatening overtone of their letter.  They suggested that they would be 
happy to send us a letter indemnifying us if it would allow EIP to sit down 
and walk through the issues that killed the deal.

I would like to be able to sit down with them to walk through these issues 
since EIP, as an organization, has been working with the company for almost a 
year.  I think they will sign a broad disclaimer.  Please get back to me as 
soon as possible with you suggestion for language.

Thanks,
Mark

It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again. The real question is 
:did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence 
w/ the future president. Maybe this says alot for Bush. He thinks Pat is as 
much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to  take him 
seriously. Wouldn't that be refreshing. You need to get the real scoop before 
lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana.

This is the asbestos case in which HPL was recently added as a defendant.  I 
spoke with Scott Wert, the plaintiff's counsel today.  HPL was sued as to 
only one plaintiff, Larry Don Williams.  I called to get info on why HPL was 
sued and alleged dates of exposure.  Wert advised me that HPL was added as a 
plaintiff because Larry Don Williams was allegedly exposed to asbestos while 
working for Thomas Construction Company at an HPL facility in Berkclair, 
Texas, during 1963 and 1964.  He also told me that Williams was allegedly 
exposed at a Houston Natural Gas Pipeline facility in Victoria, Texas, during 
1970-72.  (We have not yet been served as to Houston Natural Gas Pipeline.)  
Wert did not have information in his database as to Williams' employer during 
that time period.

Rob, as we have previously discussed, I assume that you will check to 
determine what policies of insurance might cover claims for those time 
periods.

Our answer date on this matter is next Monday, March 26, but plaintiffs' 
counsel has said that we can have a couple of extra weeks if we would like.  
I will send him a Rule 11 agreement to secure the extra time, so that we can 
investigate insurance coverage further.

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
possibility is out there.

The language that Gary Grote proposed for the indemnification provision of 
the consulting agreement is:

5. Indemnification. Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a 
successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that the Certificate of 
Incorporation (the "Certificate") of Enron Milford, Inc. on file in the 
Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary of State, State of Delaware, 
applies to Company, and (iii) that the Certificate previously supplied to 
Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the Certificate.  Company 
hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with Consultant if Consultant makes a 
claim under any of the provisions of the Certificate.

Gary has also indicated to me that alternatively he would agree to accept 
this language:

5. Indemnification. Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a 
successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that Company will abide by 
the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation (the"Certificate") of Enron 
Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary 
of State, State of Delaware, and (iii) that the Certificate previously 
supplied to Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the 
Certificate.

Cliff, Ileana and I all prefer the second alternative.  Let me know when you 
have had the chance to talk with Mark re this.  Thanks.

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

USA: Enron earnings rise 31 percent, beat expectations.

(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

Wakefield's turn, so Pedro's pitching on 24 May.  That means that if
things stay the same, he'd pitch on Thursday, 21 June and miss that
weekend against the Blue Jays entirely.

But heck, 2-0 games are boring, right?

As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been 
remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas. Robin Gibbs had always 
predicted that this was the likely result. We will now proceed with the 
battle over class certification in Kansas, which,unlike Texas, is not 
necessarily appealable. I will keep you posted..

Andy is calling now, but for those of you he does reach immediately, here is
a short report based on a conversation that he had with Mike Beatty.

Judge Downes granted the motion to remand.  A short written order will be
out later today or Monday.

He apparently read from a draft of the order, and Mike Beatty says that it
was written in high level generalities about presumptions in favor of
remand, burden to establish removal jurisdiction, etc. and did not address
the details of our federal jurisdiction (e.g., OCSLA) arguments.  More later
today.

Steve:  Did Hennigan give you any timetable for getting back to you on 
settlement?  We will need to follow up quickly.

Richard:  Hope you escaped from the storm relatively unscathed.  It sounds 
like Tuesday was a drizzle compared to what Houston experienced yesterday.

>>> <showard@agsk.com> 06/09/01 02:51PM >>>
See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.

I received another fax from, and then a telephone call from, Bernard Glatzer
today.  JJR was with me for the call (I felt that he deserved it).

What a bizarre man  The fax, which I will send you,
says to me (and Jerry Pecht, the lawyer for Bear Stearns) that "the
defendants and/or their attorneys breached the settlement agreement with me
in Glatzer vs. Bear Stearns, with whose confidential details Enron is fully
familiar."

I have no idea what this means, or is intended to convey.

Glatzer called and left word for me to call him back; I did.  He told JJR
and I that he was interested in settling his case against Enron.  I told him
that I would pass that on to Enron, but that my sense was that Enron thought
it had already won the case.  Glatzer said that, no, there were still things
he was planning to file, do, etc. and that it might be better for Enron to
settle with him now "before new lawyers come into the case."

I am sure lawyers are just lining up to take this one for him.

I told him that I could either pass on his comments to Enron, or he could
fax me a specific settlement demand.  He said he would do the latter,
sometime next week.

I have omitted all of the truly bizarre aspects of the conversation.  He did
giggle a lot, talk about President Bush's transition team, and ask me
whether I minded if he and I had a social conversation.

I will send you a copy of whatever I receive from him.

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).



Thanks,
Alan

Richard - -

This matter is riddled with insurance law and employment law issues.  If the 
independent contractor is deemed to be an employee under Wyoming law, then 
our insurance may come into play.  However, this has more significant 
implications under the employment arena.  A very valid argument exists if he 
is deemed to have been  an employee, then employment benefits may be due and 
owing.  I am somewhat familiar with these issues as I dealt with a similar 
issue for Enron Oil & Gas many years ago.

Who should I visit with regarding employment related issues?  Furthermore, if 
we have "independent contractors" driving their personal automobiles in 
discharging their duties, if they do not procure the correct insurance we 
will be facing this issue in the future. More specifically, when an 
individual places auto insurance they must tell the insurer that they are 
driving in their vehicle for business purposes, otherwise the insurer will 
deny coverage on these grounds. This is one of the issues that we are facing 
here.  

I await your response.

There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in 
California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon. They did not give us 
releases. The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not 
to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will 
be happy to answer any other questions.

Hi Mary - Do you know where we stand on the release of the orginal lawsuits 
that were filed against ECT Securities and the other underwriters regarding 
NSM?  We put out a Watch Report for Merchant assets and I've sort of referred 
to that issue with a generic comment like  "Negotiations continue regarding 
obtaining releases from the lawsuits that were filed against the original 
underwriting group that included ECT Securities."

If memory serves me correctly, there was one release that was granted - 
either from Farrallon Capital Mgmt, or Oaktree?  Do you know how many others 
are outstanding.

Please let me know at your convenience.

Thnx,

The plans are up in the air. The first weekend that we are all free is the 
weekend of Feb 26.(if you can't make it that weekend, let me know.) If all 
three of us come, there is probably 4-6 hours of work. I would propose that 
we bring Ben,James and Ryan only. I will arrive Fri night and leave Sun 
morning. Let me know what you think.

Doug and Richard,

Is the Perd going to be all work and no play? I'm trying to decide if I'm
going to take Ryan with me. We could leave around 4 PM on Friday. I could
leave much sooner, if I weren't taking him with me (school and all). I
don't think he'll be
much help to what we're doing, but he'd probably have more fun than if he
he
were to stay at home.

So, when do you guys think you'll get there? How long do you think you'll
stay? Are any of your kids going?

John

I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in 
Florida, under which the muni would allow us to periodically test turbines at 
its facilities.  They want Florida law to govern, and I don't anticipate that 
they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for 
arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of 
arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

Richard: I left a message with Twanda this morning, but I understand you
have been a little busy. On Natole: I called Tom Deen again; his client is
reluctant to dismiss Enron without seeing documents to prove that we don't
have any different records on the commission, and that we in fact did not
know about Natole's involvement.  I'm not sure I follow him, but I told Deen
it sounds  like Natole doesn't want to settle yet.  Our document production
is due a week from this Friday, and Alan Ludwig and Linda Guinn have been
gathering the documents for us to review and respond.  On Calpine: I didn't
get to draft a lawsuit before the Thanksgiving holiday, because Michelle and
Haedicke wanted me to rush a draft complaint against Duke, which I did, but
now that seems to have faltered, since we have yet to hear word that we are
authorized to file it.  I have a lengthy series of depositions that are
underway, but let me know if you want to get together on Calpine or want me
to take action, and I'll make time in the schedule for it.
Best regards,
Bill

Tom Hatch asked me today why Enron did not just settle cheap with Farallon 
and Legg Mason and walk away from all these cases.? I told him we were 
considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron 
by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom 
replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else 
would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most 
likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging 
conversation.

Richard,

Has the call been scheduled?  If so, please advise of dial in information.  
Thank you.

>>> <Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com> 04/19/01 10:54AM >>>

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for
Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard
today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that
they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to
challenge our setoffs. Any news?

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the
process of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular
has Enron completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of
the Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more
likely to hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to
file something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know
the possibility is out there.

Dear Fellow UH Law Center Alumni and Friends:

The new dean of the Law Center, Nancy Rapoport, is coming to Enron for a meet 
and greet with Enron's UH Law Center Alumni and friends on Tuesday, March 6 
at 8am in the 50M Dining Room.  

Dean Rapoport has been visiting all of the big law firms and law departments 
in an effort to introduce herself to the Houston legal community.  She has 
promised to give us a briefing on her vision and plans for the Law Center.  I 
have met the Dean already, and she is very impressive.  She should really 
invigorate the place.  

Please RSVP by responding to this email or by calling Jim Grace at x57702.

Also, please examine the address list.  If you see that any UH grad has been 
missed, please forward this on that person.  Thanks.

1. i am getting local thai counsel. have email richard out to bruce lundstrum 
re. we will file a claim even tho not submitted to cedrac procedures.
2.brian is getting a hold of jim ajello to have him call the other c 
bondholders to alert them as to the aug. 7 filing deadline since we were 
holding hands with them.
3.paul is calling cleary to document the handshake deal on what the c holders 
will get from the bs.

bondholders.
5.richard can you have the paralegal working on the case (was it linda?) pull 
the underwriting agreement, the shareholders agreement and the management 
agreement and anywhere else we think there may be an indemnity to file any 
indemnity claim we can think of? also can you do a short description of the 
lawsuit to put in the proof of claim??
6.paul is getting a general update of the status. of the case and the

                      Attorney-Client Privileged Communication


Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
recordings.
It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.

We are currently nearing the end of our audit for EnSerCo, L.L.C. and 
therefore we need to send out an internal legal representation letter.  I 
know that you were the person who signed the letter last year and therefore I 
was wondering if you could sign it for us this year as well.  If could let me 
know, then I can bring this by to you Thursday morning for your signature.

Hello Energyphiles:

OK, perhaps it was inevitable.  But it is now official.  A team of San
Diego's best anti-trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to
take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in
an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San
Diego and the rest of California this year.    A press conference will be
held to discuss the consumer class action lawsuit to be filed today.

WHEN:   11am - noon

WHERE:    550 West C  St.  (b/t Columbia & India)
  Suite 1810
  Law Offices of Levine, Steinberg, Miller & Huver
  619-231-9449

WHAT:  Copies of the filed complaint will be made available at that
time.  UCAN's   executive director and the attorney team will be
available
to answer questions   about the complaint.   We are hopeful that
we can
post the complaint to the   UCAN web site later today.

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,
Frank

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

I am Asst. Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America. As the 
title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America . I also have 
responsibility for litigation in Europe. This job carries great 
responsibilities. Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated 
more than 100%. Need I say more. In this job I am also, on occasion,when the 
mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about 
how she is conducting our litigation. Suggestions are strictly off limits.   
I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am  breakfast 
meetings to answer associate questions. There was a meeting at 7 but there 
was no breakfast served and no questions answered. Sample question: "Richard, 
why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas" Response: "I'm glad 
you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office" 
What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and 
Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed 
Bruce,they  met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.    Personally,since I left the firm 
we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months. Julie has gone back to school 
to get her Montessori teaching certification to be able to teach at Post Oak 
School.

You had left a phone message the other day about reducing the metering fee, 
but you did not state to what level.  Please let me know what that are 
specifically requesting.  Based on the volume information and forecasts I 
currently have, I am not inclined to grant a reduction in metering fees.  How 
do I counter Pintail if they decide to pursue this so as to reduce my legal

I have looked through every Archive Log that I can find & cannot come up with 
the actual contract.  Below is what I have found:

I called in a box from Archives that contains a thick file for the Conoco 109 
contract which is comprised of FERC, NGPA & TRRC filings only.

There is another box with a Conoco 109 file which is entitled "3rd Settlement 
of Gathering System Costs" which is in a storage room down on the 5th floor.  
According to Marianne, it contains worksheets, etc. & no contract.

Also, there is another box that had a Conoco 109 file containing purchase 
accounting information that is in a storage room in 3AC.  But, Marianne said 
that according to the check-out card in the box, the file was checked out to 
Bob Walker on 9/2/99.


Do you want to see any of the above files?  If so, I have the "Filings" File 
at my desk, I can ask Marianne to pull the "Settlement" File or I can check 
with Bob about the "Purchase Accounting" File.

Please let me know.

As most of you know, Enron had some discussions with Euell Energy regarding 
SPR oil.  We ultimately were unable to do any deal with Mr. Euell and 
subsequently, he publicly blamed us for his inability to complete a deal.  
Attached is an article from the Wall Street Journal.  Mark Palmer, Steve Kean 
and I spent most of Friday trying to kill the story.  In addition to numerous 
conversations, we even played tapes of the final three phone calls between 
Mr. Euell and our trader.  While we were unable to kill the story completely, 
we are pleased with the outcome.  If you have any questions, please call me

A Trio of Little Guys
Embarks on Wild Ride
In Global Oil Market
---
Pursuing Business With DOE,
Their Paths Diverge; One
Leads to `a Lot of Money' 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver, Alexei 
Barrionuevo in Tallahassee, Fla., and Jonathan Weil in New York 
? 
10/16/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of 
Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when 
the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from 
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come 
in. 
Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none 
of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as 
winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business -- 
Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., BP Amoco 
PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions 
of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets 
in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an 
additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the 
other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because 
they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. 
There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price 
crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each 
bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to 
present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after 
their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that 
requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. 
They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of 
dollars -- and fast. 
The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. 
Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. 
Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of 
graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek 
out a big business deal. 
The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the 
reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says 
he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as 
much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became 
something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, 
many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. "I thought he [Mr. 
Stroud] was some kind of rap star," recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down 
the hall from him. 
As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential 
buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets 
of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's 
apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. 
Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his 
mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with 
four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, 
amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, 
suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of 
Mr. Stroud's apartment. 
Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and 
the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective 
financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died 
at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. 
Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events 
of his life -- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy 
Department -- occurred almost simultaneously. "I'm saying `there must be some 
reason I'm here,' " he said later. "These things happening like this, the 
odds must be in the millions." 
Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says 
at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or 
$6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a 
representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that 
discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was 
confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. 
But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got 
a call telling him the deal was off. "I was upset," he says. "I mean, instead 
of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly" 
from some other source. 
A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in 
negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. "We invited them to make a 
deal that made economic sense." BP Amoco said it also had discussions with 
Mr. Stroud. 
Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the 
circumstances. "If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to 
grieve?" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, 
which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. 
Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees 
helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, 
he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil 
producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always 
looking for the big score that would make him rich. 
A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. 
district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is "one of those guys who 
shoots for the stars." On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had 
been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a 
year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. 
Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had 
already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and 
chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of 
the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? 
Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in 
charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. 
By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look 
generous. Still, he felt bullish. "I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's 
coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable." 
It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things 
around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed 
higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from 
which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. 
By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $33.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that 
meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective 
partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement 
that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he 
said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE 
required. 
Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who 
was working on the project. "I want to sign this thing up today," Mr. Euell 
told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, 
offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the 
conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under 
way: "Let me see if we can do that today." 
Mr. Euell called backed at 11:30 a.m. and again at 11:45 a.m. Each time, the 
trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were "50-50." When Mr. Euell 
suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: "If you have a bid at 
$1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the 
bush. I just have to tell you that." Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. 
Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it 
appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric 
Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: "At no time was there 
anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell." 
Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours 
and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a 
group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, 
when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper 
paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. "They 
played me," Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. 
Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant "Ph.D." in oil. Next 
time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. 
The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million 
barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. 
As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, 
Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. 
Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where 
Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last 
week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. 
Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an 
e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was 
"working relentlessly to consummate this transaction" and couldn't "entertain 
any distraction at the moment." 
On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had 
successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government 
oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes 
Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few 
details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an 
"arrangement" that resulted in "a lot of money" for Mr. Peek.

I have asked Britt to follow up on this matter. He will attempt to determine 
who are the targets of these letters. He is also doing some research on 
whether the atty violated an ethical duty by sending this letter to Rick 
Causey and others at Enron.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt

		 Subject: Litigation Counsel

Jim, we have a former employee who tried to exercise options which had 
expired on the 31st day after employment termination, as the 30th day 
provided for in the grant agreement was a Sunday.  Paine Webber refused and 
she then asked us to honour the obligation in any event or to change her 
employment termination date.  In consultation with Enron Corp. (Mary Joyce 
and Michael Fauerbacher) the request was denied.  She has now sued both Enron 
Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. in the Alberta courts.  The amount is not large 
($US27,000) but he principle and precedent value is.  I think our position is 
very strong but there are some issues around the calculation of days from 
termination and performance required on non-business days (which is not 
provided for in the grant agreements).  I have a call with Mary Joyce and 
Michael Fauerbacher of Enron Corp. tomorrow and was going to involve 
litigation counsel - Dalton McGrath - a partner at Blake Cassels and Graydon 
who is in my estimation very effective and aggressive.  Is this OK with you 
and/or do we need to involve outside counsel in Houston to monitor Enron 
Corp.'s interests?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards, Peter.

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
you about it.

Are you interested?

I understand that Ed sent the assignment agreement to your attention last
night. As you know, we simply modified the previous document to reflect the
new arrangement. This morning I noted a couple of mistakes (Sec. 6&7). This
draft shows changes from the document we sent last night. Open items include
an appropriate discount rate on the Mieco payment to Enron and whether we
will do 125 MW or 100 MW both items being discussed by Peter D'Anna and Ed
Sacks. We appreciate your cooperation.

I am on the run now, and I have not had a chance to finish the second draft
of the answers to the DOJ questions.  However, because of schedules, I
wanted to put something in your hands as soon as possible.

My secretary will be e-mailing and faxing the draft in progress to you
shortly.

I will do additional work on the draft this evening when I return from my
meeting out of the office.

So, if you have comments on the new draft, please e-mail or fax them to me
so that I can incorporate them into tonight's draft.

Subject: Natole Turbine v. IBC Turbo and Enron


Richard:
 I have spoken again today with Tom Deen, the lawyer for Natole Turbine.
 Deen still wants to mediate the case, but after talking with his client he
wants to depose Anderson, Leather, Virgo and Miller first. He says the
depositions of Virgo and Miller will be short (1/2 day each) and he wants to
try and schedule the depositions for the week of July 10. I am available
July 11, 12, 13 or 14 that week. By copy of this email, I am asking that
Miller and Virgo each advise me as to their availability then, or if
unavailable, the nearest alternate dates possible for each of them.
 I remind everyone that this case has a trial setting on September 4.
If we cannot complete this initial discovery and set a mediation promptly,
we will have the Hobson's choice either to delay the case further, or try it
with relatively little preparation time.
 I ask that Messrs. Miller and Virgo let me know about their schedules,
either by reply email, or call me at 713-844-3001.
 Thank you for your time and assistance.

 Best regards,
 Bill Ogden

It is probanly too late to respond-- but her goes:
1. We like AAA. I don't know how good ASP is.
2. I' d like a more neutral forum. The question to ask yourself--are we going 
to get "hometowned"
3. We do't usually provide for "loser pays" on attorneys fees

I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has 
been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the  
Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin 
McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at 
NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.

Richard, Bonnie White advises me that you are handling this matter with 
outside counsel.  As you are aware, the underwriters denied coverage on this 
matter back in December 1999.  They have now inquired if any Amended 
Complaint has been filed that names a Director and/or Officer of Enron and if 
no Enron or an Enron subsidiary securities are involved.  If nothing has 
changed, they will go on and close their file.  Please advise if there is 
anything new to report.

This is the judge in the Beeson case. Although I am not that fond of Link, I 
think it would be prudent to support him finacially. I suggest $500-$1000. Of 
course he will want more after the primary.

Subject: Appraisers' conference call results and next steps


Barbara Rayner and her team, Marlene Timberlake and her team (except for
Malcolm, who was unfortunately not available) and Randy teleconferenced
this morning as scheduled.  Here is what resulted:

1. We all think we can have values ready by Friday 8/31, but not full
reports which explain how we got to them and which are in formats
suitable for submission.  We need perhaps another week (but not a great
deal longer) to have suitable reports completed.  We believe this will
not be too much of a problem, based on Barbara's and Marlene's
discussions with respective counsels.

2. We all appear to be missing financial statements for Beal's Town car
for the year 1997.  Could Scarlett see if they are available and get them
to us?

3. There was minor confusion regarding Call Center as to which financial
forecast should be used.  There are at least three, but they are not
appreciably different.  Rand used the forecast accompanying the DASH.
Scarlett might want to double check to see which one is appropriate, if
this can be determined.  Not a major issue.

3. With regard to Tim's letter of 8/16 and Scarlett's response on 8/18:

A. None of us were influenced in any way by the Enron valuation numbers
submitted along with the Enron materials.  We are each preparing an
independent opinion.

B. On the Call Center interest, we will all address the issue of the
warrants: Rand pointed out that the warrants did not all vest
immediately, and that the 95.58% ownership assumption would incorrectly
reflect this.  I believe we all agreed that 82.3% is the proper ownership
interest as of 9/5/99, subject to revisiting the issue independently.

C. Everyone is treating Cynet as a separate item.  We all agree that
there is a legal issue as to whether an investment was made as of the
valuation date.  That is not an appraisal issue.

D. On the final accounting and the formula calculations, we would all
like the attorneys to explain to us exactly how these are to be treated.
Rand in particular is unclear as to how the final calculation should be
done.  We can discuss this at our Monday conference call, which Rand will
set up (through AT&T: they will call each of us) at 2:00 P.M. eastern
time, 1:00 Dallas.

4. We were unanimous in deciding that now is not the right time to share
results for several reasons:

A. We do not want to do anything that would contravene the Partnership
Agreement which might cause all of our good work (editorial comment!) to
be tossed out.
B. Sharing of "numbers only" results without final reports giving their
rationales is useless.
C. If we were to share "everything but the conclusions" now, we might
waste a great deal of time and money on minutiae, irrelevant things, or
arguments about issues on which appraisers can have legitimate
differences of opinion.

We propose instead the following:

A. We will each prepare reports and submit them as soon as possible
(relative to the 8/31 goal) as planned.  We will each submit full reports
that detail how we developed our conclusions, as well as what they are.

B. Counsels can then decide what they would like to do.  If they wish to
accept our reports and proceed, we are done.  If counsels agree
alternatively that they would like the appraisers to exchange reports, we
are equally amenable to that.  Each of us could then read the other
reports and (assuming counsels authorize this) reconsider our own
conclusions and revise them (if warranted) and/or comment on the others
in a constructive manner.  Again, we do not want to do anything that
would jeopardize the validity of what we have accomplished so far, but we
all want to cooperate to get this matter resolved.

I will talk with you all on Monday afternoon.

Linda,

Just wanted to follow up regarding signatures on the invoices.  Becky 
Stephens cannot process the invoices without an authorization signature, so 
we need to know how you want to handle this.  Since there were no questions 
noted on the invoices, we have assumed that you found them to be in order.

Please contact me as soon as possible.  I received an email from Holland and 
Hart this morning regarding their invoices and Beatty's office has contacted 
me about their January invoices.

Thanks for your help.

Gail -

To answer your questions, and being brief in this complicated case, I am
optimistic about the changes of a recovery against charterers' liability
underwriters.

Were we to revive the arbitration and it went to a final hearing on merits, I
rate the chances of success as 60:40 in our favour.  Underwriters have pleaded
the defence of inherent vice in the adjourned arbitration but the burden of
proof is firmly on them.  Further, Minton Treharne & Davies, our experts,
believe that the cargo was borderline on spec. and became off-spec. for
transit-related reasons (which cannot be blamed on the ship).  In our favour, 
we
have the Samarec certificate of quality and one loadport sample ex ship 
showing
the cargo on spec.  Against this is the circumstantial evidence of problems on
other ships and what will be a sustained technical attack on the credibility 
of
the Samarec certificate by a chemistry expert.

My instincts tell me we shall never reach a final hearing.  We will have to
revive the arbitration without doubt, but underwriters in my view have not got
the stomach for a fight.  I think they will try to settle for an agreed 
figure,
and will look to Enron to discount their claim.  We shall claim against them 
on
top of the settlement sum (yet to be paid by you), various costs and
disbursements incurred in defending shipowners' claims.  In my view they were
all reasonably incurred.  Underwriters were given every opportunity to settle
with shipowners but choose to do nothing.  They did not even bother to attend
the mediation.

To answer your queries on fees, the amount we are holding on client account is
approximately USD111,000 (Navigas settlement monies plus refund of arbitration
deposit less paid Clyde & Co. accounts).  Unbilled costs are approximately
o7,000 and unbilled disbursements o25,000.

Regards,
David Best.

I hope you will be able to (1) get Kevin McConville to come to Los Angeles
this week to meet fo a long factual meeting, (2) get us a telephonic interview
with Donna Lawry (sp?), and (3) locate the report on Kuhn Sawasdi done by the
Internal Security Department at Enron (probably in 1997 or early 1998).

Rob, Actually I sent out a demand letter, modelled on the demand letter you 
sent in the Glen Rice case, last Wednesday.   I thought that a copy had been 
sent to you, and I apologize if it has not.  (Lisa will be getting a copy to 
you this morning.)  I understood that you were on vacation and that Bob was 
going to be out on vacation on Thursday and Friday.  Because of the problem 
with CT and the possibility that our answer date would be as soon as this 
Thursday, 3/22, I didn't think it should wait until today.  When the service 
of process came in, I spoke with Andy Edison about it, he advised me of the 
Glen Rice matter, I pulled the file which included a copies of the contract, 
the certificate of insurance for Feb 2000-Feb 2001, and your demand letter.  
I asked Lisa to get the 1999-2000 certificate of insurance, which we received 
on Wednesday. We then sent out the demand.  On Friday, I spoke with Chuck, 
who had spoken with Jim Studdert, and I suggested that, with Jim's and your 
concurrence, Bob handle the matter along with the Glen Rice matter, since I 
fully expect that the defense/indemnity demand will be accepted and I suspect 
the same outside counsel will be appointed.  In the meantime, I called and 
spoke with the plaintiff's counsel re the service problem with CT and that we 
had only recently received notice of the suit.  He agreed on an answer date 
of May 1st, which I am hopeful will give enough time for the 
defense/indemnity situation to be resolved.  I have asked Lisa to draft a 
Rule 11 agreement re the extended answer date which will be sent out today, 
and I anticipate that you, Lisa, and Bob will handle the matter from here.

Please let me know if you have any questions re any of the above.  Thanks.

Importance: High

Monique, please recall you previously provided me with a copy of the Nepco 
contract with Morrison Construction for the Lincoln Center Peaker Power Plant 
in Manhattan, Illinois relative to the Gene Rice litigation.  It covered the 
time period of 2/1/00 - 2/1/01.  We know have a new lawsuit with a date of 
loss of 12/21/99.  Can you fax me ASAP a certificate of insurance covering 
that loss date, presumably 2/1/99-2/1/00, assuming Zurich was Morrison's 
carrier for the preceding time period as well.  We would like to sent out the 
attached demand letter ASAP, like we did in the Rice matter, so that 
hopefully Morrison picks up our defense.  Also, does anyone from Nepco have 
any details concerning this incident?  The Plaintiff claims to have slipped 
on muddy trailer steps while exiting one of the job trailers.

Thanks,

Subject: Michael Aussem v. Nepco etal

It is suggested that the above lawsuit be assigned to Bob Vote as its 
practically identical to the Gene Rice matter that we are currently handling 
together.  Like we did in that case, this matter should be tendered 
immediately to the plaintiff's employer, Morrison Construction, whose 
carrier, Zurich, assumed our defense and acknowledged us an additional 
insured.

It appears service occurred on 2/20/01, and that an Answer is due within 30 
days or by 3/22/01.  Please advise - thanks-

Rob

Is this the usual way Freshfield bills? Out of principle, I would ask for 
itemize bills. Please give me your thoughts.

Subject: Interfert

 You may recall that I received a bill from Freshfield's for their work in 
this case in the amount of FF 120,000 (approximately $24,000).  Because it 
was not itemized, I sent it back for itemization.  I have since received from 
Freshfield's a letter of June 11, attaching a description of the services 
performed, but with no mention of the hours spent, either for the whole job, 
or for each item.  I will send a copy of this to you for your review.

 I am not familiar with Freshfield's billing practices generally or whether 
ECT has any agreement with Freshfield's for providing specific billing 
formats.  I do not want to strain ECT's relationship with Freshfield's by 
asking for more information if that is not reasonable to do.

 Richard and Linda, would one of you provide me some guidance as to whether 
you need additional information from Freshfield's or not?  Thanks.

		 Subject: Document Retention


Tim,
 Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of
hard copies of documents.
IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY
 REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
_____ who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish.



Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Havmann

Hi Linda,
I am Director of Accounting/Reporting for the Apachi region (Asia Pacific 
Africa China) and I'm hoping you can help me with something.  We have 
received an invoice from Enron North America for outside legal costs for 
something called Havmann.  No one over here seems to know what that project 
is, but your name appears on some of the correspondence.

Looking at the backup for the invoice did shed a bit of light though, because 
some of it mentions charterers liability I vaguely remember from my EGLI days 
(too many years ago) that the Havmann was an LPG tanker.  Is it the same ship?

Can you let me know how this issue relates to Apachi, and what project it 
is.  I'm hoping you can provide an answer in the next day or so as this is an 
issue for February close.

Thanks a bunch and have a good weekend,
Paula

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Richard and Elizabeth,

At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of 
the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the 
memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our 
Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to 
analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these 
strategies.

Subject: MT Pacific Valour

Stuart / John

I have not heard from you on the matter for some time and didn't get a 
response to my e-mail to you some months ago (16 Nov 99).

I note that we have since resumed trading with Hyundai (albeit with Hyundai 
Corporation and not Hyundai Singapore Pte Ltd which was the counterparty in 
the Pacific Valour case). I also understand that Enron Clean Fuels Company 
has chartered a vessel from Chembuk Trading which our broker advised to be an 
affiliate of MTM Ship Management (the bareboat charterers of the Pacific 
Valour and the likely respondents in an arbitration).

I presume the decision is therefore not to take the matter to arbitration and 
would like to close my file on the matter. However, if my understanding is 
incorrect, please let me have your instructions.

Many thanks and regards

Matt

Subject: Strategy & End Game for FERC Proceeding


As you are aware, FERC's chief ALJ is presiding over administrative
proceedings, ordered by FERC, that ostensibly are intended to provide the
Cal. utilities with reasonable forward power supply contracts, but, in fact,
are being used equally to force sellers to the ISO and PX during the 3d and
4th Q 2000 to refund some of their profits from those sales.  The refund
will take the form of deeply discounted forward sales commitments to the
utilities.  The impetus for marketers or independent generators to play ball
is the threat that FERC may revoke their authorization to make power
wholesales at market-based as opposed to regulated cost-based rates or take
some other punitive step.

My concern is that this is a terribly one-sided negotiation.  Marketers and
generators are being asked to put their profits on the table - profits that
FERC's general counsel's office and FERC itself have concluded they have no
power to touch - and proceed to negotiate against themselves.

Enron has good people representing them in these FERC proceedings - Sue
Mara, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and, when needed, my colleague Ron
Carroll.  What I am concerned about is that they do not have a concrete
strategy or end game to pursue.  Among other things, Enron 's strategy
should include requiring the utilities, FERC  and the CPUC to put some value
on the table together with the marketers' and generators' profits.  As these
values may implicate strategy in the California civil actions, I thought I
should run my thioughts by you.

Specifically, I think Enron (and its allies) should insist that as
precondition of even considering discounted forward sales:

1.  FERC and the CPUC must commit to file in the District Ct. action
pleadings in support of a motion ito dismiss the complaints on the ground of
exclusive FERC jurisdiciton.

2.  FERC agree to vacate on rehearing as unsupported by substantial evidence
its December 15 finding that rates had been unjust and unreasonable.

3.  The utilities and CPUC commit to auctioning off all or some large
percentage of the utilities' retail customer base.

There may be other quid pro quo considerations.  I think it is imperative
that Enron decide now what they should be.   Politically (and quite likely
commercially) it is not an option for Enron to pull out of the FERC
proceedings.  Therefore, we need to start changing what is at stake in the
FERC proceeding and directing it toward our end game.

Please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.

Project Stanley is a unique, sensitive project that is being handled within a 
limited circle within Houston and Calgary.  Nonetheless, the project is being 
handled out of Houston and is incurring significant expenses, only some of 
which are legal expenses.

A separate RC was requested to be set-up under the commercial direction of 
John Lavorato and Rob Milnthorp.  The other principal contacts are from Legal 
- Mark Haedicke, and Government Affairs - Rick Shapiro.  Frankly, I (as well 
as Rob Milnthorp and Enron Canada generally) only have limited involvement in 
this project.

Thanks,
Peter

Peter,

Cheryl (from accounting) spoke to me this morning - she said that they are 
having no luck with their contacts in Houston (Accounting) with respect to 
setting up a Houston RC for Project Stanley - no one seems to know anything 
about it.

Cheryl was wondering if we have a contact in Houston - Legal that she could 
speak to about getting this set up with Houston - Accounting.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Maybe we can have Schwartz interview them on the next day (Friday) so that we

Richard: 

Roland and I are currently scheduled to arrive in Houston (i.e., the airport) 
next week at 12:30pm on Wednesday and depart at 5:30pm on Thursday.? There 
are lots of flights, so we can certainly come sooner and leave later if that 
is desirable.

I talked to Mike Swartz.? He does understand that he is to ask only questions 
designed to prepare him for depostions of Busse and Nolan of Steel 
Dynamics.?? I told him that he might be asking questions by himself, or he 
might be in with other lawyers.? (He seemed surprised that other lawyers 
might be there.)

If we can work it out, I think it would be best to have Kevin and Brian 
interviewed by Swartz separately rather than with other lawyers.? If Mike is 
in the large group interviews, I fear that we will not, as a practical 
matter, be able to draw the kinds of lines that we would like to.? For 
example, I would just as soon not have Farallon's counsel present when Kevin 
or Brian addresses the questions in Robins, Kaplan's letter of 6/13 that I 
just received.

Hello, Mr. Sanders.  I am Marty Sunde's assistant and I am writing regarding 
the 11/22/00 letter from Palmer, Guest & Esses regarding Euell Energy 
Resources.  The letter was addressed to Mr. Lay and Marty Sunde in EES 
received a copy.  We sent the letter to our General Counsel, Vicki Sharp, who 
advises that she passed it on to you for handling.  As the 12/15/00 deadline 
(set forth in Mr. Esses' letter) is approaching, I thought I would follow up 
to see if a response has been provided to them.  If this has already been 
taken care of, would you be so kind as to fax a copy of the letter to us for 
our file.  Our fax number is (713) 646-2199.

Please let me know.  

Thank you.

Subject: News Flash!  Supreme Court to review qui tam standing this term



We received this news flash courtesy of John Boese.

 CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT:  SUPREME COURT ORDERS BRIEFING ON CONSTITUTIONALITY 
OF QUI TAM ENFORCEMENT

 In a surprise announcement, the Supreme Court yesterday indicated that it 
will determine this term whether a private individual (known as a"relator") 
who files a qui tam False Claims Act cases has standing to bring such a case.

 In an FCA case already fully briefed and ready for argument on November 29,  
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel Stevens, No. 
98-1828, the court had granted certiorari to determine two issues:  (1)  
whether states have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from FCA suits 
brought by qui tam relators, and  (2) whether states are "persons" subject to 
FCA liability.  Yesterday,  the Supreme Court issued an order
instructing the parties to file, by November 30, additional briefs on the qui 
tam relator's standing to bring an FCA suit.  A panel of the Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion declaring qui tam enforcement 
unconstitutional, a ruling that would have created a conflict among the 
circuits.  See, United States ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 
No. 97-20948, 1999 WL 1034216  (5th Cir. Nov 15, 1999), discussed in 
FraudMail Alertc 11-15-99 and FraudMail Alert No. 99-11-18.  In a split 
decision, the Fifth Circuit panel ruled  that when the government declines 
intervention, qui tam enforcement of the FCA violates the Take Care Clause of 
the Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine.  However, that ruling 
was vacated and the Riley case is now before the full Fifth Circuit for en 
banc review.

 The constitutionality of qui tam enforcement has been hotly debated since 
the watershed amendments to the False Claims Act in 1986 significantly 
expanded the rights and powers of qui tam relators.  Every district court to
consider the issue, and five (5) courts of appeals, had concluded that qui 
tam enforcement is constitutional, albeit on conflicting (and sometimes 
inexplicable) grounds.  Judge Hoyt's ruling in Riley was the first district 
court opinion holding that  qui tam enforcement is unconstitutional.  The
District Court in Riley concluded that the qui tam relator lacked standing to 
sue under the FCA because he had suffered no injury in fact.  See Riley v. 
St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 982 F. Supp. 1261 (S.D. Tex 1997).  The
Fifth Circuit panel affirmed this ruling, but on different constitutional 
grounds.  It was hoped that on rehearing en banc the Fifth Circuit would also 
find the qui tam provisions unconstitutional, and would create a conflict in 
the circuits to require Supreme Court review of this constitutional issue. 
The Supreme Court's order yesterday in the Stevens
case indicates that the Court intends to expedite that consideration and 
resolve at least the standing issue this term.

 One final note:  while it is surprising that the constitutional issue would 
be raised by the Court at such a late date, the issue is not new to the 
Stevens case.  In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Stevens, 
162 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 1999), Judge Jack B. Weinstein, sitting by
designation, issued a lengthy dissent from the panel decision both on the 
issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity and on the separation of powers and 
standing issues even though the Second Circuit had ruled in 1993 that qui tam 
enforcement was constitutional.  See, U.S. ex rel. Kreindler & Kreindler v. 
United Technologies Corp., 985 F. 2d 1148 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 113 S. Ct. 
2962 (1993).  And, of course, it is not unusual for the court to question 
standing at any time.

Attached for your comments is a revised complaint in inverse condemnation, 
with the PX and Reliant as plaintiffs.? I am sending it separately to Susan 
Rossi, in-house counsel for the PX.? Since our last conference call we've 
discussed the various forums and pending actions with FERC counsel for 
Reliant and Enron. My understanding is that the PX wants us to act and will 
cooperate with us.? 

Marc, I haven't circulated this to the whole group because I wanted to go 
through you.? What is the appropriate next step?? A call with the 
decisionmakers on this issue so that we can make a plan to move forward?? Can 
we do that Monday or Tuesday?

I've set out Reliant's conclusions here.? 

1. There is no forum other than California state court in which we can get 
compensation for the commandeered contracts because of the Eleventh Amendment 
issue.

2. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with the FERC 
proceeding in Tucson Electric. 

3. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with Duke v. 
Davis or with any other proceeding anyone may want to bring alleging that the 
commandeering itself was illegal (e.g. on preemption grounds).

4.? As we discussed, nobody (including PG&E and SCE) wants the Board of 
Control to be deciding anything if we can avoid it.? We would suggest going 
along with the PX's suggestion that the bankruptcy court should be staying 
the Board of Control action because of the interventions of SCE and PG&E, who 
are taking the position that the compensation should go to them.? Then, we 
can go forward with the inverse condemnation action in state court (we picked 
LA as the forum because LA residents are less affected by the energy crisis 
than most others in the state, and because it's convenient). If PG&E and SCE 
are permitted to intervene in the state court action, we can stipulate to 
relief from stay so that it can go forward.? This way, the Board of Control 
is effectively stayed while the state court action goes forward.

5.? Richard Sanders expressed the very real concern that we don't want SCE 
and PG&E's defenses to liquidation of the block forward contracts to be 
decided anywhere but FERC.? We think we should be able to avoid that: since 
SCE and PG&E have already put the issue squarely before FERC, that defense 
could be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine pending FERC's 
decision.? We would argue that the whole case need not be stayed in the 
meantime, since the governor's duty to compensate holds no matter who is owed 
the compensation, and any proceeds from PX contracts will be funneled into 
the Moreno escrow account.

6.? As we also discussed, we can file this complaint in the name of the PX, 
Reliant, and any other market participants who want to be plaintiffs (we just 
need names and a few facts to allege for each plaintiff). Or, as someone 
suggested, if the PX Market Participants Committee is an entity that has 
standing, it could be filed in that name along with the PX.? Either way, the 
prayer for relief asks that all funds be deposited in the Moreno escrow 
account for disposition consistent with FERC's decision in Coral Power.

If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they 
clearly should not be renewed. What are the SCE LOCs for?

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

USA: Enron earnings rise 31 percent, beat expectations.

10/17/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

sent me do not include any memo from Kevin McConville dated Aug. 19, 1999.
Can you please check with Kevin regarding this memo and (if you are able to

The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in 
a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy 
has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space.
The policy can  also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where 
a Judge has required the wholesale production of  e-mails. Imagine if we were 
required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has 
happened to a number of companies in litigation  the US( who have 
subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft  
antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In 
that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging 
e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and 
others. It is unbelievable  what some people will put in an e-mail that they 
would never dream of putting in a "written"  document.
As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and 
Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. 
Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have 
about the policy.

Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas 
but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've 
read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations 
appropriately.  

Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in 
Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty 
last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, 
a long time ago.

Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like
your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference
to bad faith proceedings made by United India? (b) Is it right that Enron
has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the
draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Michelle and Ken,

were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If
you
got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.

Justin

=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20

supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of 
busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term 
strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some 
benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda 
or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The 
transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 
37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.

Talked with Gerry today and he and his group are coming to meet with me next 
week.  He suggested we get a "business type" involved.  Since this is B2B 
oriented can you suggest someone from Louise Kitchen's group (aren't they 
doing the B2B internet transactions?) Should I just contact someone in her 
group directly?

Dear Mr. Sanders - 
?
While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, 
I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well...
?
We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such 
as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our 
educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to 
the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the 
Protocol.

I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American  
Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for 
eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small 
working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial 
service  offerings.

Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology 
consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a 
day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, 
legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about 
our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief  
description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for  
discussion at the meeting.

The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services 
to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very 
concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment.

We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction 
of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, 
and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004).
?
Thanks.

		 Subject: Political Issues Raised at Meeting with CPUC re subpoenas issued to 
Enron



Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey
Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the
five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We
negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an
opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of
the request for production of documents.   This will include a further
extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a
reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We
are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in
Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.

However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and
senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,
Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with
the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the
overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme
pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was
happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many
parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the
Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing
responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of
cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which
would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such
parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.

This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.
I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never
invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so
by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded
that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply
trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery
requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment
speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve
a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron
officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this
incident.

Bernard,

This will confirm our telephone conference of today and your telefax to me of 
today.  You confirmed that you had not mentioned settlement to Interfert's 
attorneys; I assume that Interfert's attorneys have not raised the subject 
with us either.

You also confirmed that Enron has no obligation to pay anything based simply 
on Mr. Cornuot's final report, which will have to be considered by the Court 
of Appeals of Versailles before it can become legally binding, and that Enron 
would likely have no obligation to pay any additional amounts until 
approximately the middle of 2002.  You advised that the parties' pleadings 
regarding Mr. Cornuot's report were not due to be filed with the Court of 
Appeals of Versailles until October 1, 2001 and that supplemental pleadings 
could be filed until January 17, 2002.  Oral argument (trial) before the 
Court of Appeal of Versailles was set for March 7, 2002.  Based on this, you 
did not expect the Court of Appeal of Versailles to render its decision until 
around June 2002.

You have also inquired with our appellate experts as to when they expect a 
ruling from the Supreme Court of France, and expect a response within the 
next ten (10) days from now.

You will have your legal assistant translate only those portions of Mr. 
Cornuot's final report that differ significantly from his preliminary 
report.   I would also appreciate it if you would send copies of the complete 
report to Christophe Casabonne and Michel Bouthonnet.  

As soon as it becomes practical to do so, I would appreciate inquiry into how 
much Mr. Cornuot will request for his fees and expenses in this matter.

You will also advise me of  (a) your attorney's fees and expenses 
outstanding, for your billed but unpaid time (if any); (b), for your accrued 
but unbilled time and expense; and (c), for your estimated fees and expenses 
going forward, until the exhaustion of all appeals.

Last, you confirmed that you frequently travelled to London and expected to 
be available for a conference in person with Richard in either Paris or 
London, at his convenience, around March 12, when Richard intends to be in 
London on other matters.

Many thanks for your help.

Regards,

Britt

Bob, thanks.  I'll look this over, but if it is just more software to catch 
firms sending an extra associate to a deposition I'm not interested.  I think 
there is an art to managing outside counsel to get the best out them, and the 
approaches these systems follow is usually more harmful than productive.  As 
a result, I am usually pretty cool to these programs.  And I am certain that 
there is no way Kristina or Vicki will approve any payment to someone who is 
making a pitch from our business, if that is in the offing.  Sorry to be such

Rob,
 Some time ago you received a copy of the letter from Rick Salomon of Vantage 
Point Consultants which included a proposal for making a presentation to 
Enron's Legal Department regarding management of outside counsel. The seminar 
would be targeted to those Enron attorneys who are litigation managers or 
otherwise supervise the work of outside counsel. The cost for the 
presentation is $5000. From talking to Mr. Salomon, I understand that his 
seminar is an effort to expose Enron's Legal Dept to what other companies are 
doing regarding managing outside counsel, and his ultimate hope is to be able 
to enter into an agreement to provide assistance to Enron in reducing its 
outside legal costs through a variety of methods, including fee arrangements, 
billing practices and procedures and the like. Mr. Salomon's list of clients 
is impressive. Would you like me to proceed with arranging the presentation? 
I'd be happy to discuss further.

I forgot to mention to you yesterday that Don Schultz of Holland & Hart
called late Friday and asked where we were in providing information so that
he could bill the Joint Defense Group for the work done on the Kansas motion
to dismiss.

I told him that the bills had been assembled and would be sent to him
shortly.  I don't know whether you have already sent the materials to
Schultz.  If not, do you have everything that you need from me?

Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met 
Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston 
Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 
year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his 
daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded 
custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix 
called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his 
second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income 
threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to 
handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry 
company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a 
garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six 
months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year 
old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously 
considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother 
and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his 
divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is 
current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to 
move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his 
daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of 
brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in 
law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the 
mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An 
attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, 
I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on 
his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help.

Subject: Meeting with Ft. James

On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.  
I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that  
FJ did not act in good faith in "expeditiously and fairly evaluating" all of 
Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue 
from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that 
commodity deals were never the "intent" of the Alliance as outlined in the 
"Objectives of the Parties."  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement 
to do commodity deals.

Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of "substantial assets" as it 
related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us 
because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also 
substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas 
consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before 
informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance 
partners treat each other. 
I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the 
situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to 
continue with it "as is."  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.

I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to 
their counsel Greg Chaffee.

Next Steps:

I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our 
case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential 
deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case 
to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the 
value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to 
do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving "bad faith".  

I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with 
the entire project list and the various "reasons" FJ chose not to do the 
projects.

Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute 
within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are 
to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the 
mediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take 
place anytime between now and November 10.

Let me know if you have questions.

Howard,

My partner Steve Susman forwarded me a copy of your email to him.  Our firm
looks forward to meeting with your committee on Wednesday.  While I had
planned to attend when the interview was scheduled for last Thursday, I
cannot come this week because I am starting trial in Chicago.  I am not sure
yet who from our firm will be attending, but can assure you that we are very
interested in the case.  Whether by ourselves or jointly with Marshall
Grossman and his firm, we think this sort of lawsuit is right up our alley.
We know how to get a complex commercial dispute ready for trial, maximize
its settlement value, or try it successfully if necessary.

I'll try to give you a call Monday or Tuesday to let you know who else from
our firm will be joining Marc Seltzer, who heads our LA office, at the
interview.  You can reach me at 713-653-7827 if you wish.

By the way, there is considerable information about our firm and its lawyers
at our web site, www.susmangodfrey.com

Thanks, Howard.  I look forward to speaking with you.

Richard -- Yesterday, I received a call from Jill Ptacek, a lawyer from the
DOJ's Antitrust Division, regarding the remaining aspects of the DOJ's
Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next
week.  Please let me know who we can make available for 60-90 minutes.
Thanks. -- Paul Yde (202-639-6685)

Richard, we have several form contracts being developed and used in EBS that 
include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting 
agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with 
any questions or comments.

motion.  The request, from Jane, is that they would like to first see if we 
can
resolve this without the need to incur more legal fees and that a delay of a 
few
weeks to allow that process to continue will not prejudice either party.  The
schedule right now, as set by the court yesterday, is the Trust's response is
due on Nov. 13th. and our reply would be due on Nov. 17th.  The court is
scheduled to hear argument on Nov. 28th.

I like the idea of keeping pressure on them, but I don't view an extension as
unreasonable or as prejudicial to EPMI.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Richard,
I do not know this person personally, but I know very well the corporate 
culture  and the law firm culture from which he comes.  He has worked for 
TransCanada and the law firm of Walsh Young.    You probably need to discount 
the probative value of my comment as being too vague and subjective,  but all 
things considered, I would give a thumbs down to this guy, and suggest that 
we try to get someone from one of the firms up there.    Please call if you 
are interested in general background comments. ----cgy

what is the basis for that determination?

The whole purpose is not to end up in the Bronx, or in family court in 
Albany.

Acceptable NY Courts





Here's a new one in our continuing saga of acceptable New York courts.

Currently, (with appropriate GC approval) we can specify United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County ("USDCSDNY") or
the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of the State of
New York sitting in New York County.

In-house counsel for Chase Securities Inc. would not accept this provision
without a caveat that if a judge of the specified state court determined
that some other branch or division of such court sitting in NY County
should have jurisdiction, we had to accept jurisdiction in the other branch
or division.  Rather than risk ending up in an unacceptable forum, both
sides agreed to limit jurisdiction to the USDCSDNY.

I believe Joel may have checked earlier this year on New York courts with a
V&E litigator in New York.  If so, we might want to get further guidance on
this point.

Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them 
totaling over $8.5 million. These cases are, for the most part , suits to 
collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The 
likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small.

well hello there brothermen and sisterwoman.  it sure seems as if a few
moons have passed since we tickled the keyboard and thought about all y'all
for a spell, and that is not how it ought to be.  so stop your grinnin' and
drop your linen (not sure what that means but i dig it) and let us repair to
the chat room.

started a new job just last week and by all means it is a Godsend.
(blasphemous?)  would that i had found this school a couple of years back,
as it is well-run and full of good folks.  by the latter i mean folks who
are here for the long run or at least a good while, and not fresh off the
boat.  perhaps the best aspect of it is a 25 hr workweek, while the most
abominable is twofold:  i gots to sport a nametag and a wristwatch, and i
reckon the former is the lesser evil even though it is as goofy as Bill
Morris.  the only times i have voluntarily donned a watch were deb parties
back in the day - got a black running watch to go with the tux and showed it
off something fierce.  back in the idol-worship days of namu and ricardo and
stevo.

at any rate, that is the good news and i can feel y'all waiting with bated
breath for the bad stuff.  here goes:  last month had a weeklong hiking trip
to the japanese alps - a big ol' hunk of honshu virtually unknown and
unexplored by the japanese as they cordoned it off as an abode for their
shinto psuedo-deities - planned and set off with a native lady friend guide.
  on our first day of hiking she sees fit to slip off a log bridge and
faceplant some two meters down onto a rock with nary a limb or digit to
break the fall.  can you say ouch?   she couldn't - knocked out cold with a
visibly growing pool of blood about her noggin and limbs splayed in a most
unnatural Deliverance-type manner.

enter the hero rolland, you say?  well not really.  ran over there and did
all the things one knows not to do to a potential head/neck injury and
checked her out.  skull was not in pieces and after cleaning up the mess we
discovered a smashed face instead.  had to hike back several kilometers to a
hut and thence to an ambulance.  hospital revealed a broken nose, severely
lacerated lips and two teeth knocked out.  poor girl, hey?  but hey - i was
the one escorting leon spinks back to osaka on the train with alpine dreams
in the rubbish bin.

what is the bottom line, you ask?  as always:  better her than me!
that was probably more than y'all wanted to know about that, but it really
spooked me  - even more than being privy to the intimate details of the
condition of susan's overworked nipple.  how is that nipple, susan?

and that was a good move blowing off elizabeth for emily, y'all.

and concerning kudos, how about our basque following in my very own
ubersuccesful footsteps and putting her nose to the grindstone to become a
teacher?  good on you!  just the thought of it makes us want to jump for
joy, get some oxygen and repeat "oh happy day" over and over.  and it brings
us to take a moment and reflect about our various occupations and their
contributions to society, which could well be graded as follows:

1. John (the Healer):  the guy actually saves lives, a tough act to top.
2. Julie (the Developer):  enables young people - aka the future - to form
their little craniums and warns them against going to law school.
3. Doug (the Facilitator):  helps doctors help patients.
4. Moi (the Ambassador):  doing my part to further international
understanding by means of instruction and exchanges of culture as well as
bodily fluids.
5. Stevo (the Wheeler-Dealer): not really sure what he does, but a reliable
and consistent contributor to the national GNP.  also sires chilluns easy on
the eye, so gets an honorable mention for that.
6. Danna, Susan, Jean Helen, Yvonne (the Mamas):  doing a guten job but for
the purposes of this list, y'all represent neutrality.
7. Maury (the Beltway Insider):  'nuff said.  only your professed desire to
escape and recover some semblence of sanity puts you above
8. Richard (the Suit):  doesn't chase ambulances but as Enron is a big mofo
company, you can bet that he is an integral part of the energy-procuring
wing of the military-industrial complex, and as such is one of Them.
probably knows who killed JFK and is rumored to be the Grand Poobah of the
Masonic Lodge.  the list goes on, but then we come to....
9. Camille (the Investor Extraordinaire):  not exactly a negative
contribution to society, but still sold crystal and brazos riverfront
property.  lost moi a whole heap of cashish, so brings up the bottom.

on the whole a rather notable family, more inclined to give than to take for
the most part.  almost chokes us up to think about it.  truth be known i
have been thinking about y'all as of late and might be close to setting a
date to come on back to hallowed soil.  no reason to set any dates as chisel
is far from stone at this point, but it shan't be too long methinks.

john the eldest and danna the nappiest, y'all should have received letters
by now.  let us know if that is not the case.

well i just scrolled up and found to my dismay this is not as funny as i had
intended.  oh well.  it is better than nothing - i think - as nothing (in
regard to correspondence) is something with which i am well acquainted.
(exception: stevo!)  someone give a holler -

hope all y'all are well and lording over all you survey in your pure
unadulterated Aryan splendour.  i remain

chillin', never illin'
(in my mouth i gots 4 fillin's)


the Ralai Lama

were referred to you by Mark Haedicke in connection with some inquires I have 
regarding the application of the attorney-client or work-product privileges 
to internal operational audits.  In particular, I am interested in Enron's 
standard practice in that regard and any standard or sample documentation 
used to cover the audit reports by one or both of the privileges.  Im also 
curious as to whether the same approach has been used with respect financial 
audits regarding internal controls.  Pls let me know.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

Here are the results of our efforts so far:

Discussions with Local Counsel:
 Here is the list of firms and individuals that we have contacted as
well as the results of conflict checks and availability.  In short, There
are some conflict issues with several of the firms.  One firm was directly
conflicted.  Another has as one of its partners, the wife of Len Simon, the
lead plaintiff's counsel in our case.  Assuming that conflicts can be
resolved, we have five different lawyers available to be interviewed on
Monday.

 <<status11.30.doc>>
Economic Experts

 Local

  Retained:  Carey P.  Mack,  Bruno & Mack
  The best testifying expert in town, economic accounting
damages.  Relates best to San Diego jury.   Not an anti-trust
model building type of expert.

  Tom Lambert
   Solo (he is checking conflict list right now.  If no
conflict, he is willing to work for us.)

  Broadshatzer, Wallace, Spoon & Yip
   Roberta Spoon (on vacation)
 National
  Charles River
    Gordon Rausser will be meeting with CEO of
Enron, Ken Lay on other matters on Friday 10:00a.m. in Houston on another
matter.  They are very interested in being retained.  They are doing
conflict check. He is willing to stop by and see you if that would be
helpful.
  NERA
   Waiting for response

Non-testifying Consultants

 Larry Ruff
  RETAINED: to assist in reviewing EPMI data.

Procedural Issues:

 We are investigating to see whether there are any California
defendants to consider removal.  Because we  attended  the press
conference (momentarily and obtained a copy of the complaint) we should
assume that  the removal clock is ticking.
News Reports

 We have identified a service that has recorded the news reports
about this lawsuit.  There are 28 hits so far for TV reports.  It will cost
$300 per clip to obtain them.  Do you know if Enron is getting these clips
from the public relations firm?  Should we get them?

Anti-Trust Law School Professors.

 We have identified Tom Campbell (ran against Diane Feinstein for
Senate.  We have a number for him in Washington good until tomorrow.  He was
former Director Competitive Compliance Division FTC, has Harvard Ph.D. in
Economics.  Should we contact him?

Thanks

I am sending an e-mail about the power plant. I as told by an employee of
the plant they would let us know why the plant made so much noise and  so
much vibration. I have heard nothing but noise  and felt vibration. my wife
is scared because of the add in the news paper about how the plant could
explode if the person in charge of it made a mistake . I was not informed of
this plant being built. The newspaper said that the plant was being built in
a nonresadintal area there are 8 homes in this area alone. We should not
have to put up with the noise and vibrateing. Me and my family moved in the
country to avoid all the noise . Now that is all we here we can not enjoy
the outside like we use to and i am tired of it no one tell anything.
someone needs to tell us something .I thank you for your time.

 Employees bid for bankrupt mill


Friday, 3 September, 8:30 p.m.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. (CP)

FORMER EMPLOYEES of bankrupt Gallaher Thorold Papers said Friday they
have filed a letter of intent to buy the paper mill. Details of the bid
were not immediately available. "We have developed employee ownership as
a viable alternative in several other locations," Cec Makowski,
vice-president of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of
Canada, said in a release.


The union said it has led successful employee ownership bids at Ontario
paper mills in Kapuskasing, Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie.

A letter of intent was sent to the receiver, Ernst and Young, with the
support of the employee group, the management group and the
International Union of Operating Engineers.

The union represented most of the mill's 310 workers, who were laid off
when the Thorold plant shut down May 25.

The mill, which produced a variety of paper products including
envelopes, wallpaper and consumer packaging, has not operated since and
was put into receivership in June. It can make products using 100 per
cent recycled paper.

Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don
Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is
much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary
hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he
has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my
mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty
pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my
lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone
that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres,
and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
Thanks for your help.

		 Subject: Dig up in Texas by PFNet

John, 
             We were dug up at two locations between Liberty and Beaumont by 
a contractor working for PF Net on Monday, June 26.  The contractor was 
Dan-Rik Construction Company out of Lafayette, La.   The contractor hit and 
damaged our facility at two locations, one being between our existing splice 
# 1 and splice #2,  three thousand feet of China.   The other location is 
under a canal, in the same vicinity.  

   The contractor contact information is : Dan Rik Construction Company
                                                                             
PO Box 92868
                                                                             
Lafayette, La. 70509
                                                                         
                                                                             
Tel: 318.232.2488

They are a sub-contractor to: Manuel Brothers, Inc.
                                                          908 Taylorville 
Road, Ste. 104
                                                          Grass Valley, Ca. 
95949
           
                                                           Tel: 530.272.4213

   We are in the process of  restoring our facilities and will invoice 'Dan 
Rik Construction'  all costs associated with the restoration.   PF Net is 
following our route through Texas into Louisiana and I am concerned about 
dig-ups that may occur bwtween China and the Louisiana border.  Is an 
injunction the only way to keep them a safe and reasonable distance from our 
facitlity?  Can we somehow put them on notice that we won't tolerate any 
future dig-ups and that if they do  damage our facility, we will replace it 
from splice to splice at their expense?  Please let me know.  

Thank you.

Brad Cheney

AA has requested that I find out what legal fees (amounts and to what firm) 
have been paid on behalf of ECT Securities as it relates to the NSM 
litigation.  I don't remember how we came up with a number last year.  Under 
the services agreement between ECT Securities and ENA, it allows for ENA to 
pay expenses such as these, but they will want to footnote it in the the 
financial statements.  What can I do to track this information down?  HELP!  
Thanks. Donna

Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case. There is only one slight 
problem---we have no idea what case this is. Neal Manne at Susman represented 
us in a case against Duke that settled early last year. We have no active 
litigation  or disputes against Duke. My curiosity is pegged out. I asked Bob 
Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries.

Richard,

I am the new Financial Settlements Manager working for Kim Theriot.  In 
reviewing our Account Receivable
Report, we noticed an $ 8.7 million dollar (May 2000) unpaid receivable from 
Badak Gas Marketing, Inc.
The explanation I received on this is  that legal is negotiating a 
settlement.   Is this an accurate statement?
If yes,  what is the status?   Your assistance is this matter is deeply 
appreciated.

Enrique Valero, our onsite project management, just sent the attached note. 
Most urgently, payday for about 300 employees is tomorrow, and the employees 
are expecting this check before the Easter holy week holiday starts.

If possible without violating the order, , we would like to get the employees 
paid. Bob, I can't remember how we solved this last time out, but I remember 
it was an issue. Please call so we can discuss.

John:

Please give further advise as how to operate down here in Tampico. We are in 
the middle of (3) Projects, where we (Enron/Cigsa) have commitments to pay 
out that are project related:
Labor
Labor Taxes
Materials
Consumables
Import Duties
Miscellaneous
Payment for Transportation of Structures (Barge/Tug)

The funds to pay the above are in CIGSA Construccion's name, although I am 
one of the two authorized signatures in the bank, and no funds can be moved 
unless I sign a check.

What is the impact of the below message on the above categories?

Also, what about when we CIGSA/Enron/ODB (CAByL) receive payments? CIGSA 
invoices CAByL and then the money is wired to Enron. What is the impact on 
this?

Please advise as soon as possible.

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

Richard,

As requested, below please find language that I recommend be included in the 
Settlement.  The first sentence preserves Enron's right to appeal the 
findings of an ADR proceeding that may emanate out of this matter to FERC or 
any competent court; as it turns out, this right is provided under Section 
4.1 of the PX's Dispute Resolution Procedures.  The second sentence is 
intended to preserve Enron's right in other proceedings (as we have done 
already) to challenge the legality of ISOs and PXs to conduct investigations 
such as the one that they have in this instance:

"Nothing in this Settlement prejudices or limits Enron's rights under Section 
4.1 of PX Tariff Schedule 9, Dispute Resolution Procedures, related to any 
ADR proceeding that may address the same subjects that are addressed in this 
Settlement.  Moreover, although Enron has agreed not to seek review of the 
decision and order issued by the Chief Executive Officer in this proceeding 
based upon this Offer of Settlement, nothing in this Settlement prejudices 
Enron's right in other proceedings to challenge the CalPX's right, under 
United States federal law, the Federal Power Act, the Administrative 
Procedures Act, and applicable FERC regulations and decisions, to investigate 
allegations of improper market behavior and to issue findings and impose 
sanctions related to such investigations."

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Ron

A qualified yes.  It doesn't look to me that we have much choice. 
Remember--we were withholding freight as leverage to settle, which is a short 
term strategy at best. I am going to discuss it in detail w/ Britt Monday 
morning. I'll let you know if we come up with a better plan.

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the "bug" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

Britt

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, "pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the "pre-sale" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to "bugs". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
"bugs" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described "changes" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th. I heard 
from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for 
one-half day. That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from 
Cleveland, we should make good use of this time. I think we should schedule 
an entire day. Let me know your schedule.


I have forwarded Larry Oscar's letter regarding Durrel Metal 
Products/Sterling foundrey to Mike Smith and Bob Williams(713-646-6412) at 
EES.Bob is my counterpart at EES  Let me know if they fail to respond.

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank 
me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we 
agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, 
Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will 
also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with 
his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare 
the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.

Why don't we file a lawsuit in state district court in Houston, serve them, 
and wait for their counsel to appear or take a default. We need to force them 
to respond. Let me know what you think.

		 Subject: ENA v. Triad


Andy,

This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gas 
sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one 
address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around 
February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and 
then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms ("confirms").  Per ENA's usual 
custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although 
there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these 
deals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any 
money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 
2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a 
recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that 
Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.

Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an 
arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a 
list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 
7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an 
extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.  
This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call up 
Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland 
secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.  
The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told 
Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) 
he was "aware of us".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have 
been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that 
we sent to that address.  

What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, get 
a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that 
we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.

My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to 
send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any 
other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so 
that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for 
these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad 
an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. 

Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely 
that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it 
until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award 
enforced.  I don't see a way around that problem.

Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.

Britt

Thanks.

Britt

Jeff,
 I am looking for a good patent attorney for personal reasons.  I talked to 
Elizabeth but she was unable to think of someone.  Do you know of anybody?  
Thanks for your help.

Best Regards,
John Berger

I am sending an e-mail about the power plant. I as told by an employee of
the plant they would let us know why the plant made so much noise and  so
much vibration. I have heard nothing but noise  and felt vibration. my wife
is scared because of the add in the news paper about how the plant could
explode if the person in charge of it made a mistake . I was not informed of
this plant being built. The newspaper said that the plant was being built in
a nonresadintal area there are 8 homes in this area alone. We should not
have to put up with the noise and vibrateing. Me and my family moved in the
country to avoid all the noise . Now that is all we here we can not enjoy
the outside like we use to and i am tired of it no one tell anything.
someone needs to tell us something .I thank you for your time.
                                        Thanks

		 Subject: Status of Duke Energy v. State and ISO v. Reliant et al.


Richard,

 Per Gary's request, here is the status of Duke Energy v. Governor
Davis and ISO v. Reliant.

Duke v. State of California.

 According to a news article, on February 27, 2001, Duke Energy Corp.
suspended its lawsuit against Gray Davis and the State "after the California
Department of Water Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was
formerly being provided under contracts with two financially trouble
utilities."

 Originally, Duke argued that Governor Davis exceeded his authority
under the Emergency Services Act when he commandeered Duke's long-term
contracts.

 The case is suspended until an April 30 hearing.  I am trying to
obtain a copy of any order and/or stipulation filed with the Court.

ISO v. Reliant, et al.

 I.  Brief Summary of Complaint

 In ISO v. Reliant, et al., ISO seeks a preliminary injunction to
require six Reliant entities, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading, four AES
entities, and Dynegy Power Corporation (collectively, "Defendants") to
provide generation in response to ISO's emergency dispatch instructions.

 ISO's sole allegation is that because Defendants submitted to the
ISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering into
Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements,
Defendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatch
order.  This allegation is based upon section 5.6.1 of the Tariff.

 II.  Current Status of the Case -- February 23, 2001 Stipulation

On February 23, 2001, the parties entered a stipulation, which states, in
relevant part:

   The Reliant Defendants, Williams, and Dynegy
(collectively "Generator Defendants") will comply with emergency dispatch
orders of the California ISO under the terms of the ISO tariff without
regard to whether ISO allocates the cost of power produced in response to
such a dispatch order to a creditworthy Scheduling Coorindator until the
earlier of the following:

   (a) 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on March 19,
2001, or

   (b) two business days (but in no event less than 48
hours) after written notice to this Court and the parties by a Generator
Defendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it.

   3. Notice of termination by a Generator Defendant of
its obligation under paragraph 2(b) shall not affect the stipulated
obligations or remaining Generator Defendants except that, on receipt of
such notice, each remaining Generator Defendant shall have the right to file
with the Court an election terminating its obligation. In the event of such
an election, the obligation of a terminating Generator Defendant to comply
with ISO dispatch orders imposed by paragraph 2 shall end 48 hours after
written notice to ISO of the election to terminate. Each terminating
Generator Defendant shall have the same right and status to participate in
any legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of termination,
including any appeal.

   4. The motions heard by this Court on February 16,
2001, including ISO's motion for preliminary injunction, Reliant's motion to
dismiss or stay pursuant to the FERC order, and DWR's motion to dismiss
Reliant's third party complaint, will be deemed submitted at 5:00 p.m. on
March 16, 2001, or at 5:00 p.m. on the day written notice of termination of
the obligation stipulated in paragraph 2 is filed with the Court, whichever
is earlier.

 III.  February 16th Hearing

 Below is a summary of the hearing held on February 16th in the
Reliant case, which I initially prepared on Saturday, February 17th.  I
apologize if you did not receive this earlier.

>  The hearing involved three motions:
>
>  (A) ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>  (B) Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or Stay
>  (C) DWR's Motion to Dismiss Third Party Complaint
>
>  Judge Damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he
> will issue an order on or before February 21, 2001 at 5:00 p.m.  He
> ordered the February 8, 2001 TRO to remain in effect until then.  Judge
> Damrell clarified that the TRO requires Defendants to respond to all ISO
> Emergency Dispatch Orders ("EDOs") regardless of the creditworthiness of
> the purchasers.  The Judge encouraged Defendants to stipulate that they
> would respond to ISO EDOs, and gave Defendants until February 20, 2001 to
> do so.  (It appears that only AES is willing to do so at this time).
>
Summary

>  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Reliant's Motion to
> Dismiss/ Stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same
> issue:  Are generators obligated to respond to EDOs despite having no
> assurances that they will be paid, i.e., assurances that a creditworthy
> purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the EDO?
>
>  A.  Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or to Stay
>
>  Reliant's motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based
> solely upon a February 14, 2001 FERC order conditionally adopting ISO's
> proposed Amendment 36.  This FERC Order (as I understand it from the
> arguments) allows ISO to waive the creditworthy requirement only with
> respect to PG&E and SCE scheduling of energy to meet their own load.
>
>  Parsing the Order, Reliant argued that the Order implicitly means
> that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other
> purchases, including EDOs.  Because of the FERC Order, Reliant argued that
> ISO's complaint, which seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to
> respond to EDOs without assurances of creditworthiness, should be
> dismissed.  Alternatively, Reliant argued that because the proceeding
> before FERC continues, the Court should stay this case pending the outcome
> by FERC.
>
>  ISO argued that according to the language of the FERC Order, FERC
> explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the
> creditworthiness requirement to EDOs.  And, a stay is improper because due
> to energy crisis, ISO cannot wait for FERC to decide this issue.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell appeared very skeptical of Reliant's
> interpretation of the Order.  He asked, "If FERC intended that the
> creditworthy requirements apply to EDO, why didn't it address it head-on,
> especially because the importance of this issue was raised by Dynegy
> before FERC?"  He questioned Reliant about several sentences in the Order
> which suggest that FERC explicitly did not decide the issue.
>
>  Judge Damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings.  He stated that
> the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not
> wait for FERC to rule.  He made several comments about how long it takes
> FERC to act, and that the Federal Courts should step in times of crisis
> such as this.
>
>  B.  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>
>  In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require
> Defendants to provide generation in response to EDOs, ISO argued as
> follows: (1) Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in
> the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and
> Participating Generator Agreements; (2) Section 5.6.1 of the Tariff
> obligates Defendants to respond to EDOs; (3) EDOs are essential to "keep
> the lights on;" and (4) because the decision to issue EDOs are made only
> in times of emergencies, the ISO does not look at who the purchaser is, is
> not required to by the Tariff, and should not be required to because of
> the current energy crisis.
>
>  Defendants argued that they need not respond to an EDO without
> assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because
> (1) the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the Tariff;
> and (2) a 2/14/01 FERC Order held that the creditworthy requirement
> applies even EDOs.
>
>  Dynegy raised an additional argument -- ISO and DWR are using the
> EDO procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real
> threat that the lights will go out.  According to Dynegy, DWR can back
> real time purchases including EDOs, but instead DWR backs only purchases
> at a certain price below market.  If generators refuse, ISO issues an EDO,
> with no assurances that the generators will get paid, as a strong arm
> tactic to get this below market price.  Dynegy argued that the reality is
> that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the
> EDOs, DWR has enough money to buy at market rate.  There would be no issue
> here if DWR would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity,
> rather than using EDO procedures to lower the rate.  And, DWR can go to
> FERC if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards
> the ISO.  He expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue --
> do the Defendants have an obligation to respond to EDO's without
> assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis.  His questions
> and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to
> the EDO's is small and necessary to avert rolling black-outs.  He
> questioned Mr. Detmer, manager of operation of ISO, who suggested that
> about 5% of purchases at peak are made through EDOs.
>
>  Judge Damrell was not very sympathetic towards Dynegy's argument,
> asking "Are you was saying that DWR, ISO and the State are the cause of
> the crisis?"  Several times, Judge Damrell stated that he thought the high
> wholesale prices caused the crisis.  According to Judge Damrell, "the
> simple fact is, you got rich, and the utilities went broke."  Also, as
> noted above, Judge Damrell does not believe that waiting for FERC to make
> decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because FERC
> does not act quickly enough.
>
>  C.  DWR's Motion to Dismiss 3rd Party Complaint

 Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR, and DWR moved
to dismiss.  As framed by the Court, the key issue is:  does 11th Amendment
prohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case?  Judge Damrell asked about
the 11th Amendment immunity argument, stating that the issue was not
thoroughly briefed.  The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefs
on the issue.

 I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I will
summarize DWR's argument in a subsequent email.

I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House 
of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) 
What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been 
traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, 
LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her 
impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling 
rivalries going

I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our 
participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job 
with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his 
financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are 
pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for 
District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a 
Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her 
chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was 
not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me 
on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she 
will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to 
have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with 
their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition 
at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen 
anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a 
firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told 
me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it 
Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?

I wanted you to be aware that we may start to see some negative press from

up simply not responding publicly.

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

Lunch as you proposed sounds good. Thanks in advance for waiting for me.

Richard:

I've arranged for both Judge Lacey and Stu Alderoty (both from our Newark, NJ 
office) to join us for lunch on September 27th when you are in New York.  
I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working 
on the Infineum case, can attend as well.  Based on your planned arrival into 
LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:00/1:15 
p.m. range.  I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 
W. 55th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)--19th Floor.  
If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
know.

On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
to facilitate anything for you in that respect.

I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
well.

Best regards.

John

Richard -

Steve Mitnick (202-997-0924) called to find someone at Enron to discuss his 
ability to document fossil fired generation production by hour over the last 
few years.

I am not sure if this is helpful in your defense of the litigation 
surrounding CA, but thought you should know.  Steve is a consultant that 
worked with us on PECO.

I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I 
think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the 
issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you 
need to make this motion?

Richard,

Do we need to consider filing a motion to transfer venue of this case on the 
ground of bias in the jury pool?  Do we prejudice your cases if we don't?

Subject: Resume of William "Woody" Walters



Richard:  Here for your review is the resume of Woody Waters, employed as an
in-house attorney at Texaco in its Burbank, CA offices.  He has been with
Texaco, first in Houston and now in Burbank, since he earned his joint law
degree and MBA in 1990.

Within Texaco, he is a transactional attorney and has two specialties:
First, he supports Texaco Global Gas and Power in all aspects of project
development and finance, in its efforts to develop cogeneration power plants
in domestic and international locations.  Secondly, he has provided legal
counsel to the Texaco Marketing Department with a focus on franchising and
marketing/distribution as well other transactional matters and contracts,
including licensing, trademarks and antitrust matters.

Woody is not from the Portland area nor does he have family here, but he has
travelled here extensively and would like to relocate to Portland.

>From a timing aspect, Woody has another in-house offer from a bay area
employer with a two-week time table in which to reply.  He has expressed high
interest in an Enron opportunity and would be pleased to discuss his
background more in detail in a telephone pre-screening interview.  If you
would like to do that, let me know and I will set it up.

		 Subject: IGL Claim 

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this 
week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited ("IGL") 
against Enron Exploration Company ("EEC").  The claim appears to relate to 
the recent execution of an upstream gas development "Term Sheet" in 
connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to 
participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 
Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's 
earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don 
Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. ("EOG") that EOG will in all likelihood ask 
Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested 
April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of 
further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to 
call on me.

Kind regards,
Dan

I went to the Courthouse today for the Vinmar hearing on the motion to compel 
and for sanctions related to the traders tapes.  Before the start of the 
hearing, we met outside the courtroom with Vinmar's lawyers.  They apparently 
finally came to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement covers this 
discovery dispute, and, after some discussion, they agreed to pass the 
hearing.  We will work with them to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator 
this week, if possible, and they can have this issue heard before the 
arbitrator.  This morning they mentioned three former judges as potential 
arbitrators: Ruby Sondock, Alvin Zimmerman, and Susan Soussan, although I 
think their preference out of those three would be Alvin Zimmerman.  He would 
also be my preference out of those choices.  They may send us other names 
that they would consider using as an arbitrator, but, in the meantime, let me 
know what you think about these three.  Thanks.

Hopefully this provides what you are looking for, however, there is more to 
come.

Please note the fourth paragraph requesting the total labor and expenses for 
the "big picture".  This was discussed at our first meeting and hopefully, 
you can produce same or make it available to him for inspection.

Also, we need to quickly resolve the "missing System 700 book".  If it 
exists, lets produce it.  If not, we need to advise that it was 
miscommunication or whatever, but we need to do so soon.

I thought we were going to advise that we had appointed a "point" person to 
deal with extracting information from the subcontractors.  Apparently this 
was not communicated to Claude.  Do you want to re-consider allowing him to 
go direct?

Subject: Doyle Peaking Plant #1 Unit, Monroe, GA - Mechanical Breakdown


Jim/Russ/Ron,

This will confirm our tele-conference this AM on the pending claim filed on
behalf of Doyle.

Unfortunately, my meeting at Dean-Oliver did not fully take place on the
intended scope as Charlie McCorkle had to take his wife to the doctor on an
unexpected trip.  I am out of town until Friday, but we do plan on meeting
Friday afternoon, I will respond on any additional information outstanding.
(Charlie had Kelly McKenzie's book with him)

You had ask that I further explain our deductions on the reduced Craft Labor
hours detailed in my last letter.  In our December meeting it was noted that
NEPCO was in a support roll to Elliott on the rebuild.  NEPCO had their most
involvement at the very beginning and very end of the repairs.  The repair
area had its own trailers, parts warehouse and staging area.  We discussed
in the meeting that the support roll essentially would take a Supervisor and
three employees per shift or about eight per 24 day.  In review of the
submitted labor it is noted that an average of three Start-up Employees
charged their full day to this job from 6/15 up to 7/3, then 4 up to 7/17,
then 6+ up to the final completion of repairs, 7/23.  At the same time,
Office Staff employees averaged charging up to 8 employees per day, day
shift, during the repair time and continued to charge labor up to a month
after.  The Craft Labor group charged an average of 11 employees per day
charging all of their work day to the repairs.  When you average it out, you
had around 13 support personnel for an Elliott crew on every shift (24
hours), when the Elliott crew consisted of about 13 to 15 persons.  This
would account for between 25 to 30 people (without consultants &
sub-contractors) time charged working every hour, 24 hours the entire time.
Add the consultants/subcontractors and it goes up to a minimum of 30 people.
This is unrealistic by any standard and cannot be explained away as an
inefficiency of site versus shop work.

One of our requests in our meeting in Houston was that additional
information concerning the total labor and expenses charged to the entire
site be made available to see the "big picture" of the site labor and
expense charges on a weekly or monthly basis.  This additional information
or it's location has not been forthcoming to date.  There has to be some
type of summary cost details which Doyle was billed on a per Unit basis.

I also noted that I would comment on differences in scope of repair, thus a
lesser measurement of the loss & payable claim.   I have been commenting on
differences in scope since my first letter and subsequently as information
has been made available.  The major scope differences are:
1. Partial vs. full stationary and rotor blades
2. Repaired versus replaced 1st Stage Turbine Buckets & Nozzles
3. Use of "old" designed stub shaft vs. purchase of "new" designed stub
shaft
4. Overscope of repairs by Preco on work completed in their shop.
5. Elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items,
misalignment and other items noted in my e-mail of 1/24 (including work
completed on Units #2 & #3).
6. NEPCO labor charges noted above.

There are a number of lessor items.  If the meeting this Friday takes place,
I will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based on
documentation we have received to date.  It is unfortunate that there was no
"System 700" or similar type book completed on the repairs.  Our discussions
in Houston and up until recently indicated that this was an SOP at NEPCO.
As I noted the Kelly McKenzie book is not a complete view of the repairs
made.

The request to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of
work in my last letter has not been responded to.

Once again, I will e-mail you after our meeting Friday with any requested
support items that were to be included in this e-mail.

Today, I talked to the GC of both Southern and Duke.  Each GC said they
were not
really up to speed on the issues.  I took the opportunity to walk them
through
the Nerc letter and the action taken at the Serc board meeting.  They
each
attempted to argue our fight was really with TVA.

I have received an invoice from the Rockets for next season's tickets. The
total amount is $19,712.00, or $112 per seat. According to the Rockets,
there will be no increase for this season or the 2002/2003 season (but wait
until the new arena is built in 2003!). The breakdown is as follows:
Bill Gage (25%): $4928 (less $736 previously paid);
Bob Roten (25%): $4928;
Glenn Ballard (12.5%): $2464;
Pat Doherty (12.5%): $2464;
Richard Sanders (12.5%): $2464; and
Bill Eggleston (12.5%): $2464.
If you want to renew, I need your check by June 15. If you do not want to
renew, call me as soon as possible at 713/659-5100.

Hi Richard--

Because you liked it so much, I have made dinner reservations at Ducz in 
Pasadena.  The reservations are for 7:00 pm.  Bill Price, Duane Lyons and I 
will meet you there.  John Quinn may join us as well.

Gina is going to fax you directions to the restaurant from LAX.  One of us 
can drop you off at your hotel after dinner.

Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
place.

any retailers?

Richard --

Here's the draft.  They might come back with some response that our
agreement is not unconditional, but if they do not participate in the
redetermination process, they run the risk of losing the right to do so.

The last line is for you.

Richard,
As I mentioned in my phone mail message to you, we are compiling info on the 
above-referenced entities in connection with a due diligence request by a 
potential purchaser. The prospective purchaser has requested information on 
the entities' litigation, whether complete, existing or pending including any 
eminent domain proceedings and insurance litigation. Could you let me know as 
soon as possible if you can provide me that information. The goal is to have 
all requested information in the data room early next week . 

Thank you,

The questioning by the panel did not reveal their intentions. The attys who 
were there  think that the case could go either way. We should know in 2-6

Gentlemen:

This lotus note is to advise you that trial in the captioned matter is 
scheduled for January 17, 2000 and mediation is scheduled for November 16, 
1999.  We have authorized $50,000 in settlement authority.  I have advised 
our outside counsel that I am available to attend the mediation.  Dave Howe 
told me that he needs to check with the other parties involved as it was his 
understanding that only trial counsel are going to attend the mediation.  In 
any event, Risk Management will be available by telephone if more authority 
is necessary.

I will keep you abreast of all significant developments.

Alan, can you ask Marshall Grossman if he is available to make a
presentation on May 24 at about 230 pm at the Greenberg offices following
the general Committee meeting that will start at 1 pm?  I will ask the
Greenberg firm to be ready at about 330 pm.  Richard, could you ask the
Quinn Emmanuel firm to be ready at about 430 pm.  Let them know that the
schedule might slip to some extent.

The other possible candidates that I have heard about are the Susman Godfrey
firm, the Kaye Scholer firm (although I am waiting to see a preliminary
resume to share with the Subcommittee to decide if we want to see them) and
David Boise (spelling? the attorney that represent Al Gore in the ballot
dispute).  Richard, you are going to call the Susman and Boise firms to see
if they are interested.  I am going to talk to the Kaye Scholer people to
see if they make sense to consider.

Are there any other candidates we should talk to?

I am traveling Thursday and Friday and will not be able to review my emails.
Please leave me voicemails at 310/203-2903.  Thanks.

As you know, several weeks ago we retained an attorney out of Wahington DC to 
assist us with the EPA permitting issues. The need for counsel was put on 
hold when we decided to move the plant. Is ther anything more we need to do 
to follow up on this matter?

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 


	



TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

As you can see, this recent default judgment/adversary proceeding appears to

Subject: Perk Development Corporation; Brambury Associates bankruptcy

On Friday, 10/06/00, we received through our service of process procedures, a 
certified mail envelope advising us of a default judgment in the amount of 
approximately $23,000 ($20,825.43 is the principal amount of the alleged 
preference payments, plus interest) against ECT in an adversary proceeding in 
the above-referenced consolidated bankruptcies.  The bankruptcies were filed 
in 1998 in the Western District of New York (Rochester).  We had not received 
any prior pleadings in the bankruptcy or the adversary.  I am trying to 
determine if this relates to ECT/ENA accounts or to EES accounts.  Please 
advise whether EES has/had any accounts with these entities and/or whether 
EES filed a claim in the bankruptcies.  I have spoken with counsel for the 
Plan Administrator who filed the adversary proceeding.  They apparently sent 
service of the adversary to ECT by certified mail addressed to our PO Box 
1188, Houston address.  It never made it up to us.  In any event, I would 
like to determine as quickly as possible whose account it is and whether we 
have any defenses to the preference allegations.  Plan administrator's 
counsel has told me that he will hold off on executing on the judgment for 
10-14 days to hear further from us.  If we can explain why we didn't receive 
service (I think our response is: you didn't serve our registered agent) and 
we can show defenses to the adversary, they will likely voluntarily set aside 
the default.  In any event, we need to determine this as soon as possible in 
case we need to file a motion to set aside the default judgment.  Thanks.

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

Regards,
Darren Adamik

Per Jeff Shankman-
The attached document reflects the ENA Gas Risk Management & Middle Marketing 
Groups.
Everyone who appears on the list has a recorded line.  I am aware that all 
tapes are destroyed 
after a certain time period; however, it is imperative that these particular 
tapes are never destroyed.

Please archive these tapes in a secure location.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses=

4:00 p.m.

The issues to be discussed are as follows: 

1)????? Service of all anticipated parties;

3) ???? Facts that are presently available to support the pleadings filed by 
each party; 
4)????? Injuries; 
5)????? Damages; 
6)????? Whether the amount in controversy will exceed $25,000; 
7)????? Alternative dispute resolution, including mediation, arbitration; 
8)????? Anticipated law and motion; 
9)????? Preliminary schedules of discovery; 
10)???? Possible settlement; and 
11)???? Other relevant matters. 

Although many of these issues are directed to a plaintiff, we too will need 
to take positions on many of these items, particularly Nos. (3) & (7) - 
(10).? We also need to better understand the nature of the dispute and our 
strategy going forward.

I would like to set up a conference call for Monday, May 1, 2000 at 11:00 
a.m. (PST) to discuss the foregoing.? Please let me know if this time is 
convenient for you.

		 Subject: aj collins versus houston pipeline

Richard,

I am forwarding an e-mail that I received today from Durango Petroleum re the 
Collins matter in Hardin County.  I spoke with the company president today.  
He believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the 
matter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to 
defend it.  I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to 
pay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.  I am 
concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a 
year ago to remove the pipe/valve.  I asked him if he had any correspondence 
or other evidence of that .  He will check and get back to us.  Lisa 
Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its 
file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.  
If we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to 
a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove 
intentional trespass.  However, I still believe that Collins will have a 
difficult time proving any actual damages.  We need to be cautious about not 
getting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping 
Collins to prove his case.  

Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two 
weeks.  We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 
17.  Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.  He 
sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for 
production along with the notice of trial setting.  Lisa Robichaux will work 
with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.  We also intend 
to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return 
(July24).  In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for 
continuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of 
his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.  
However, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not 
granted.  I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Bonnie

You sent me a note yesterday asking what has happened to the Robert Burns 
matter (the $11 million invoice).  I have talked to Mr. Burns' lawyer and 
told him -- in essence -- that he is crazy and that we don't intend to pay 
his client a dime.  We'll just have to sit back and wait and see if a lawsuit 
is filed.

		 Subject: CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 
783 6582.  Many thanks.

Mike Williams at CIG called today to advise that he received an announcement
from Donald L. Flexner, formerly of Crowell & Moring LLP (DC), that (1) Mr.
Flexner has now joined David Boies' firm, and (2) Boies' firm has changed
its name to Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP.

Mr. Flexner previously rendered anti-trust/other legal services to CIG, and
Mike is exploring whether Flexner's joining Boies' firm creates any basis
for disqualifying Boies, Schiller & Flexner in Quinque.  To this end, Mike
asked that I contact Enron's lawyers to learn whether Flexner has also
represented any Enron entities in the past.

If you know of any representation of Enron entities by Mr. Flexner, please
let either Barrett Reasoner or me know.

Thanks,

CONFIDENTIAL - - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

To all, other than Richard, please do not forward this e-mail on to others.

Richard -

As a follow-up to your request for information in support of any possible 
legal action at Gleason, I'm forwarding the attached news report.  I have 
copied only the three principle people (Eric, Ben, Mark) involved in 
analyzing the complaints, gathering information in support of your legal 
research, and responding accordingly.

A few comments:

1.  A third party analysis (Southwest Research Institute - - SWRI) showed no 
abnormal noise within the hearing range.
2.  SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration.  
This is well below the hearing range.  There are no vendor, regulatory, or 
otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range.  The fleet of 501 
FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range.
3.  SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection 
system in the combustor.  We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens 
Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve 
the following:
 a.  Is there a problem
 b.  If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause 
of it.
 c.  Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible 
problem (damping material in the stack, etc).
4.  Since we instrumented and tested (by SWRI), we have not had significant 
run time.
5.  Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week 
to hammer out the detailed plan.
6.  The run season is coming to an end, and I expect fewer than 16 total run 
hours before next January.
7.  We are working to resolve whether there is a problem, and if so to 
correct it; however, since this is a new generation machine, any efforts have 
to be coordinated with the OEM (SWPC); therefore, an expeditious 

My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are 
doing, but I want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in any legal 
jeopardy.  Advice? I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have 
significant comments/advice.

	THE ANIMAL IS THE BONOBO.
	SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR OWN  NAME FOR THIS UNUSUAL PRIMATE."THE PEACEFUL CHIMP."
	LIZ  PURCELL TELLS US WHY THE NAME FITS IN THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES  REPORT.
	BONOBOS ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRIMATE THAT EXISTS ON  EARTH. PHYSICALLY,
	THEY STAND OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GRACEFUL BUILD  AND ROUNDISH FACE. SOCIALLY
	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE  VERY PEACEFUL.AND VERY
	SEXUAL.PRIMATES.
	"LIKE CHIMPANZEES  BONOBOS ARE OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE. THEY WERE  ONLY
	DISCOVERED IN THE 1920'S AND IDENTIFIED AS A SEPARATE  SPECIES FROM CHIMPS."
	WHILE CHIMPANZEES ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE  AND THEIR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY
	MALES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF  BONOBOS.
	"BONOBOS ARE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL BECAUSE FEMALES ARE  THE MOST TIGHTLY BONDED
	IN THE GROUP AND THEY USE THOSE BONDS TO  CO-OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND
	THEN DOMINATE MALES AND THIS IS  VERY RARE AMONG MAMMALS."
	BONOBOS REJECT VIOLENCE IN THEIR  COMMUNITY. THEY USE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO
	EASE TENSIONS AND SETTLE  DISPUTES. AMY PARISH MONITORS THE DAILY
	ACTIVITIES OF A GROUP OF  BONOBOS AT THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK. THERE
	ARE FEW IN  CAPTIVITY ANYWHERE--AND THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS IN  THE
	U-S.
	"AARON, KILI, COME HERE." 
	ANIMAL  KEEPERS AT THE PARK FIND THAT THE BONOBOS ARE SO QUICK AND  SO
	INTELLIGENT THAT WORKING WITH THEM IS A REAL  CHALLENGE.
	"THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE CREATURES. THEY'RE  CONSTANTLY PLAYING, MOVING,
	FORAGING FOR FOOD."
	BONOBOS  LIVE IN AN AFRICAN RAINFOREST IN THE CONGO BASIN LOCATED IN  THE
	COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZAIRE. THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE  THEIR FOREST
	IS BEING DESTROYED BY LOGGING COMPANIES. AND THEY'RE  HUNTED FOR FOOD. 
	FEWER THAN 20-THOUSAND OF THESE ANIMALS ARE  ALIVE IN AFRICA TODAY. THE
	BONOBOS, THEIR UNIQUE SOCIAL SYSTEM  AND THEIR HABITAT ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
	THE  WILD.

		 Subject: NGX Litigation and Outside Counsel

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Subject: NSM Litigation



Richard and Linda:  I attended the Demurrer Hearing/Status Conference in the
Farallon case this morning.  Judge Berle sustained the Demurrers, providing
Plaintiffs with twenty days to file an amended complaint.  Steve and I
believe that this twenty-day period provides us with a critical opportunity
to try and persuade Plaintiffs to drop ECT from the lawsuit.  In order to do
so, however, we need to accelerate our fact gathering so that we can
articulate with precision ECT's role, or lack thereof, in the purchase and
sale of the NSM Notes.  While the Offering Memorandum (p. 179) states
generally what Notes were purportedly purchased by ECT and other "initial
purchasers," we must understand (i) what Notes were sold, (ii) to whom and
(iii) by whom.  This requires a discussion with Travis McCullough and, quite
possibly, Kevin McConville.

Steve and I would like to have a call with you early next week regarding the
foregoing.

Thanks,
Roland Tellis

		 Subject: Can Fibre Lackawanna

I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default 
under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The 
Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in 
full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, 
etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does 
highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to 
weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with 
respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that 
remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation 
expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not 
replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not 
going to fund.

I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   
Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.  
An analysis would include.

1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make 
sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.  
In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we 
want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put 
them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need 
to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.

2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the 
current default.

3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 
million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).  
By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they 
cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.

Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.

Twenty percent of the golfers always drop out at the last minute and you end 
up with more threesomes than foursomes. You should reconstitute the teams. 
There are three benefits: play is faster,teams are more balanced,and you get 
to know more people.

This is the form of confidentiality agreement Duke wants executed before

Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for
Enron's motion to compel.  As you may recall, they say they want a
deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

Thanks.

Richard, we have located charts prepared by someone at ECT indicating that
ECT held on to 11,750 units of the "B" NSM notes.  The Offering Memorandum
indicates that ECT was to purchase 12,210 units of the B notes.  Thus, it
appears that some 500 units were "sold." We would like to discuss the charts
with Travis or Kevin (during the visit to Houston - if not before).

Thanks.

Dear Mr. Williams,
?
This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? One of the most exciting aspects of  that meeting was 
the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.
?
Should you have any questions, you can reach me by e-mail 
(gstrathmann@mediaone.net) or  telephone (978-376-9004).
?
Thank you.

Further to our discussion on Friday, the contact person to speak to about the 
litigation files yo now have concerning MG is Arthur Taylor. He can be 
contacted on 212 715 5635.

He is prepared to assist in bringing you up to speed with the litigation, 
however you should note that he is not an employee of the part of MG which 
Enron purchased and is assisting on a "grace and favor" basis to enable a 
smooth transition. I suggest that there is likely to be a limited window of 
opportunity in which to get the most from any briefing and you should speak 
to him as soon as possible.

Subject: Warranty claim by Enron Teesside Operations Limited against ICI 
Chemicals & Polymers Limited ("ICI")

PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY - CLIENT COMMUNICATION  : CONFIDENTIAL  

Mark / Dan / John

As you are aware , earlier this year , we served formal notices of two 
potential warranty claims ( re. the Halochems. closure and the DuPont reduced 
steam-take ) on ICI , as required by the Sale of Business Agreement . We have 
subsequently prepared a detailed draft analysis and costing of our claims 
(the "Particulars of Claim") which has been served on ICI's lawyers , Herbert 
Smith . They have come back with some requests for supporting documentation 
which we are currently dealing with.

The Sale of Business Agreement requires us , unless ICI agree to settle which 
seems highly unlikely at this stage , to issue formal court proceedings 
against ICI before 21 November in respect of the Halochems. claim and before 
17 December in respect of DuPont  . We wish to deal with the two claims 
together and , accordingly , it is proposed that we issue proceedings , at 
latest , on 16 November . Issue puts us into a formal procedural timetable . 
ICI would have 14 days to reply indicating whether they wish to defend and a 
further 14 days to issue a defence , though this period is generally capable 
of being extended by a further 28 days . The process of discovery , whereby 
each side has the opportunity to examine relevant documentation in the 
possession of the other , would probably begin after 3 months or so . If we 
were to go to full trial , this could be in the second half of next year .

If we don't issue proceedings before the relevant dates , we lose the right 
to bring the relevant claim completely unless ICI has waived the requirement 
that we issue proceedings by these dates , which they have shown no 
inclination to do.The downside of issuing proceedings is that , whilst we are 
entitled to withdraw them at any stage if we decide not to proceed with the 
claims , we would then be liable for much of ICI's legal costs from the date 
of issue to the date of withdrawal .  Our lawyers' view  is that , were we to 
go to full trial and lose , the potential aggregate liability for ETOL's 
legal costs and ICI's legal costs would be between o1 million and o1.5 
million (our current costs are around o70 , 000 ).

In terms of the chances of success of our claims were we to go to full trial 
, I believe  , and am advised , that the DuPont reduced steam-take claim is 
more likely to succeed than the Halochems. shutdown claim . Given the legal 
complexities of contractual warranty claims , I do not think it would be wise 
, at this stage , to be overly confident of success at full trial . However , 
there is certainly , in my view , good potential for achieving a settlement 
with ICI which may involve more than simply a cash payment (eg restructuring 
of key contracts , land deals etc. ) .We do know that , as a matter of 
practice , ICI ignore potential claims unless proceedings have been issued . 
Issue of proceedings should , thus , be viewed primarily , at this stage , as 
a necessary means of getting ICI to the negotiating table . Their costs will 
not ramp up significantly until discovery starts , so we should be ready to 
monitor closely and constantly our prospects in the litigation as against our 
potential exposure should we withdraw or lose .

On the basis of the above , I would recommend that proceedings are issued 
against ICI and would very much welcome your views or comments on this.

Regards.

Jon

Richard,

We are not going to send this letter until Monday.  We want to send the
formal objections to the subpoena concurrently, and Mike Smith cannot review
the EES objections until Monday.  Mike Day believes that a delay until
Monday is not a problem.  Let me know if you have any concerns.

coal. Pittston's chief technical guy was George
Denton, now retired and , I believe, is available for consultation. George is 
highly respected and has a vast amount of

Attached is the discussion of our net earnings for question 2.  I also did a 
little tinkering with the last paragraph from the last version I sent.  I 
haven't looked at Ron's proposal yet so if Ron rewrote this paragraph I may 
want to defer to what he said or figure out how to "simonize" (ha ha) the 
two.  Sorry to send this to you so late.  I thought I had sent it yesterday

Subject: Re: Latest Draft


Gary, Thanks for your comments.  They were most helpful.

I agree that I have swung for the fences in that discussion, and I am not 
overly optimistic that FERC will reach out and specifically assert preemption 
(although its assertion of preemption could be implicit in its actions).  I 
thought that the argument that the market would be damaged by ongoing 
litigation might have some appeal at FERC, and it was worth a shot.

Until I read your email, I thererfore saw no downside in asking.  The 
question that I have for you is how strong would an allegation in court be 
that the mere fact that we asked for a preemption finding, as to which FERC 
did not address, constitutes a negative finding that FERC elected not to 
assert preemption.  Not having done the research, my sense was that such a 
result would have no precedential effect, along the lines that a denial a 
cert by the Supreme Court is not precedential.  This is an important point.  
Perhaps we could schedule a call with Mary, et al., to discuss strategy.    
Ron


>>> "Fergus, Gary S." <GFergus@brobeck.com> 12/01/00 12:04AM >>>
Ron,
 Your latest draft has minimized the earlier concerns that I had.
You are definitely swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, you are asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.  There
is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it, that fact will
diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has
been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our preliminary research
has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti-trust laws,
for example, the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway.  I
know that this may be the one chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.
If FERC does make the finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not
know how to assess the likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding,
and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal, so it is difficult for
me to do a risk benefit analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  "if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs."

 I know Mary is still working on the economics response.  I will look
at as soon as it comes in.

Thanks
Gary

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Richard, 

Folllowing our meeting of the 9th November, I have now written a business 
requirements document, which will be included in the final specification to 
be sent out to the vendors under consideration for the supply of voice 
recording services. This document is attached below. 

Before sending out this document I wanted you to have the opportunity to 
review the content and comment upon any statements made within it. 
In order to progress this component of the ECS project we will be sending out 
a specification at the end of November, so if any feedback could be given 
before that deadline, it would be appreciated. 

I will ensure you are also sent a copy of the final specification provided to 
the suppliers. 

Thank you for your assistance with this matter. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse

Read JB's response to my phone call below.  I'm not sure what's going on but 
if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a 
number of questions which are relevant:

Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%?
Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment?  What is his authority as a 
signatory?  If he's not an officer of this "Ecogas S.A." then why is his 
signature evidenced?

We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below.  Once received, 
I'll forward them if they're pertinent.

Randy,

I am concerned about our conversation of yesterday morning.  I sent by fax
to you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American details
which have Ecogas involvement.  As stated over the phone and set out in the
documents, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.  The
documents which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest as
it does not and never has existed.  I simply would not act in that manner
and would have expected you to hold that understanding.

Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that we
all direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather than
continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.

Regards,

Jerrel

** PRIVATE **

Richard:   I've put on the fax to you a copy of 2 of our invoices for legal 
services on the Brazos FERC/Cert. matter--one from Sept. and one from 
November--that are still outstanding.  I thought in particular that the Sept. 
invoice may have been lost in the system since an invoice for the following 
month has been paid.   Also, I know that the Sept invoice had originally been 
sent to Dan Lyons since we also were doing related work on the Brazos project 
and Dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall, but my 
understanding from Dan was that he was going to send the litigation related 
invoice to your attention for your review and approval.  As you will recall 
from your Bracewell days, this is the time of the year that the internal law 
firm billing people hound the partners to follow up on outstanding bills.  Of 
course, if you have any questions on the invoice or need any further 
information, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thanks , Richard.  I hope 
that you are doing well and bearing up ok in the face of the day to day 
turmoil in CA.

John

Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill 
Gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think 
they are shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had 
talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made 
and that I would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's # 
is 713--225--4500.

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

Thomas:
On my way back to the job site after a meeting in Dever, with Rooney
Engineering. I received a call on my cell phone from Mike White site manager
for NEPCO telling me a OSHA compliance officer was on the job site. Mike J.
Mc Williams, Mike White, and I walked the site, looked at all records and
spoke with NEPCO, CIGC and Jomax personnel. MR. Mcwilliams and I had a close
out interview meeting after the inspection. He said the job site and records
were in order and no major violation were seen with the accident or the job
site. His only comment was he saw a missing clip on a out-boom. He will issue
a report on his inspection within 6 months.
Accident reports from NEPCO, Jomax and CIGC will be forward to your office on
Thursday March 29, 2001. If you or your offfice need addtional infor. please
let know.

Richard --

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their 
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on 
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?

Richard,

I have received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Mark D. 
Gately, now of Hogan and Hartson.  Gately was the lead partner on this file 
with Miles & Stockbridge before he changed firms toward the end of the case.  
He is billing us for 6.75 hours at $325 an hour, for a total of $2,193.75.  I 
find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for 
payment.  

I have also received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Miles & 
Stockbridge, for work done from October to date.  There are three timekeepers 
(with billing rates from $290 to $115 an hour) who charged a total of 17.70 
hours, for total fees of $4,101, and total expenses of $1,1129.30, for a 
total bill of $ 5,230.00.  I find the bill in order and ask for your 
authority to place it in line for payment.

Let me know if you wish to review either bill yourself, or whether you wish 
to pay the bills yourself.

Britt

ratepayers committee


To: CalPX Participants' Committee

Howard Weg has asked that I poll the committee members because several 
members of the committee have advised that they believe we should take a 
position supporting PG&E's motion to vacate the UST's appointment of a 
Ratepayers' committee in the PG&E bankruptcy case.  The idea is to file a 
brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, 
representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 
billion in claims against PG&E, as scheduled by PG&E in its list of 20 
largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed by the PG&E 
creditors' committee.  Our joinder would state that there is no statutory 
basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in the best 
interest of the estate.  We might also indicate that we agree with PGE and 
the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for ratepayers to be 
heard which make more sense than giving them official committee status.  We 
would also appear telephonically at the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on 
this issue.  Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to 
the committee taking this position.

Thank you.

Richard --

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their 
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on 
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?

Subject: Motion for Stay



Richard:

As you know, Glidden filed a motion for stay of proceedings today.
Scarlett is working on an initial draft of a response.  I will be in
Austin tomorrow at Graves Dougherty, but she will fax the draft to me
there, I will edit it and we will get something over for you to look at
tomorrow evening.

As we anticipated, what prompted this was our insistence on the
appointment of the third appraiser--so there is no need to reevaluate
our strategy at this stage.  We will simply proceed as planned to file a
response in opposition to a stay of the appraisal proceeding and,
simultaneously, a plea in abatement/motion for stay asking the judge to
stay Intrust's common law claims pending the resolution of the appraisal
proceeding.

I will call you to check in with you about mid-day to get your thoughts.
I will also have my cell phone with me, (713) 249-2677, and you can
reach me there if need be.

Thanks,

KP

P.S. - Could I trouble you to forward this on to Gene Humphrey and Mark
Lay?  I'd like for them to know the drafting schedule, but I don't have
their e-mail addresses.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

I have reviewed the proposed filings with FERC, at least the latest drafts.
There were two issues related to the definition of market power and the
proposal for penalties for underscheduling load that I believed needed to be
changed and they were.  I believe those documents will be filed in the next
few hours.

As to CPUC, Harvey Morris has been tied up on the PUC's FERC filing and has
not called us.  Mike Day anticipates a call early Monday.   So far, no news
is good news.

If you need to reach me this holiday, I will be at our house in Inverness,
California.  (415) 669-1531 and I will check email periodically. Please have
a pleasant Thanksgiving with your family.

Thanks
Gary

Linda-

Attached is a schedule detailing the gain/loss calculation for Ice Drilling.  
Apparently PriceWaterhouseCoopers acted as a receiver and sold Ice Drilling 
in August 99.  We received total cash proceeds of $9,583,845.74 between 
August and September, but the value of the asset on the books was 
$9,979,591.85 (loss of $395,746.11).  We also wrote off a receivable of 
$474,557.83.  In summary, we lost a total of $870,303.94 ($395,746.11 + 
$474,557.83).  I am assuming that we are trying to recover the total amount 
lost of $870,303.94.  Let me know if you need further information.

I just accepted approx. $250,000.00 settlement from the insurance company to 
cover part of our losses and expenses from the Styrene contamination.  I have 
been assured by the insurance company that this settlement will not hamper 
Enron in going after Baytank for additional funds.

Once I receive the paperwork on the settlement I will forward it on to 
Richard Sanders here at Enron.  The Insurance company has recommended a joint 
lawsuit to try and collect the remaining lost funds.  The insurance company 
will go after Baytank for the $250,000.00 as soon as possible.

We will still have roughly $500,000.00 on the books from last year.

		 Subject: Depositions of Our People


All parties have agreed to extend discovery cut off from 1/19 to 3/5/01, but
only for depositions of scheduled persons.  The "protected" list includes
Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe,
and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump.  The list does not include
Kevin McConville.  I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin
Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two
depositions.

Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed.

As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want
to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. 
They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days.
 We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and
no more.  That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it.

service.  You and I should discuss this also.  Either way, we need to alert
Akin Gump what is going on.

Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

Yt
Web Macdonald

Sorry, it has taken me awhile to respond.

Could you clarify that Liskow & Lewis is not representing TDC in a

Laurie and Alan: confirming my call with Laurie today, our existing client
has waived the potential conflict we mentioned, and I ask your advice as to
whether Enron would also be willing to waive.

The potential conflict is in a totally unrelated matter.  We represent TDC
Corporation.  I understand that there is a dispute between TDC and Enron
relating to a collar agreement.  I am not certain if this is merely in
dispute or if it is the subject of litigation at this point.

If Enron is not interested in our undertaking the representation at the
Orion facility, we certainly understand.  If it is, would it be possible to
obtain a waiver of the unrelated conflict?

Thank you for your patience in this matter.  Marilyn

FERC Chief Asks Congress For Retroactive Rate Authority 
  
09/21/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James 
Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order 
refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. 
Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the 
commission's investigation of power market volatility in California this 
summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last 
year. 
Congress should give FERC "authority to retroactively correct extraordinary 
wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and 
consumers cannot get out of the way," Hoecker told the House Government 
Reform Committee. 
The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&Electric Co., a 
unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market 
situation in California. 
FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained 
"unjust or unreasonable" prices for the power they sold into California 
electricity markets overseen by the state's power exchange and independent 
system operator, Hoecker said. 
But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can't order any refunds beyond the Aug. 
23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation's chief energy 
regulator noted. 
"We do not now have that authority," he said. 
"The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding 
investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be 
prepared to take further measures, as appropriate," Hoecker testified. 
"The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state 
will moderate price volatility in California markets," he said.

Richard:  

Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 
12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph 
starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To 
further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty 
extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has 
a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of 
increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the 
request.

Hope your son's doing well.

Jeff

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

		 Subject: Roger Atkinson v. Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and 
NEPCO.

This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen 
Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technologies 
Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the 
Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy 
Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective 
late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to 
represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters 
before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  This matter 
relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at 
a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  David Waterson 
of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity 
obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this 
incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if 
any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and 
to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen 
case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as 
Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the 
construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have asked Becky 
Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or 
NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of process is 
in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.  As this 
new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a 
copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate 
the claim in your usual manner. 

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to 
begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks.

We argued the issue of additional document production this afternoon.
Morris took it under advisement.

The One Oak issue came up.  Morris said he had not realized it involved an
Enron entity.  He will stay away from it.  I assured him it was no problem.

He also disclosed that he had presented some award to Ken Lay recently at an
industry conference.  Smith assured him that was no problem either.

Roland-- I think that Brian is the correct person to sign these discovery 
requests. Having said that, I do not remember talking about that before you 
sent the e-mail to Brian. You need to go through me for that kind of decision.
My only comment to the Interrogs is that Brian should use his old title in 
Int. #3

Subject: DOJ Indiana Investigation: Privileged & Confidential



Richard -- Yesterday, I received a call from Jill Ptacek, a lawyer from the
DOJ's Antitrust Division, regarding the remaining aspects of the DOJ's
Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next
week.  Please let me know who we can make available for 60-90 minutes.
Thanks. -- Paul Yde (202-639-6685)

		 Subject: CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 
783 6582.  Many thanks.

		 Subject: Request for Conflict Waiver


One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Thanks
Gary

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry. Obviously, I am heading up the 
overall CA litigation strategy for Enron. Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead 
trial counsel in all the CA cases. He is out of Houston. Mike Kirby was hired 
as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been 
impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit. I 
have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely 
with me and Robin. Is this as clear as mud?

indicated, and as Richard Sanders mentioned in the earlier conference call 
today, I am taking the lead in dealing with Sen Dunn on behalf of Enron. 
Please send to my attention the transcripts of the prior hearings and any

I just spoke with Mike Day.  He received a call back from Harvey Morris at
the CPUC.  They have not yet had a chance to read our response and cannot
convene the group that needs to look at it until tomorrow.  (Mike reads that
as they are giving it to a consultant for comment.)  We have a scheduled
conference call with Harvey for 10:00 a.m. PDST on Friday.  I will call in
from Mexico.  Peter will set up an 800 number and call in ID.  Once Mike,
Peter and I are on the phone, we will conference in Harvey.

With respect to the production of documents, I told Mike that the documents
were being shipped here and we would process them on Friday.  We will
address delivery on the 10:00 conference call.

As an aside, Harvey apparently said that a number of other companies had
decided to cooperate after being threatened by the CPUC staff.

If you need to reach me in Cancun, the Brobeck satellite office number there
is 011-52-98-810962.

Thanks
Gary

Here is a summary of recent developments:

Another Class Action Natural Gas Complaint Against El Paso and others (Los
Angeles)
 Berg v. Southern California Gas Company. Class action anti-trust and
unfair competition.   This is a conspiracy case alleging that the Southern
California Gas, SDGE and El Paso  conspired not to compete in the
delivery of natural gas in Southern California.  The  complaint alleges
that the conspiracy resulted in discouraging new power plants and drove
up the cost of electricity by controlling the supply of gas.
 <<Berg Gas Complaint.pdf>>
Copy of Rojoin Electricity Complaint
 I do not believe I include a copy of this complaint before.  It is a
class action involving the retail electrical market.
 <<Rojoin.cmplt.PDF>>
California AG Investigation
 Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our
agreement re preservation of data:
Rich,
 As promised, here is my summary outline of what we discussed
regarding preservation of data:

1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the
topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete
any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does
not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discarded
etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup made that will
capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24 hours, each
employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the
business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our conversation, I understand
that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure.

2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals that
you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy
files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out which
computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed that
because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this started
until after the new year.

3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along
business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your
request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or functions.
On a going forward basis, those business functions that related to the
subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business
email.

4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
continue to be made and preserved.

5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network
(where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to make
sufficient work space for the employee to work.

6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do
not have as detailed information immediately available.

As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being made
are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may
have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction, relevance,
privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically reserves each and
every right and objection it or its employees may have.

Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is
different than the above.
CPUC Subpoena
 Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI
data correctly gathered.  They hope that by the middle of next week the
Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have
assembled it for production.  Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after
the New Year, we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next
year.
 Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data
that will be used for all subpoenas, discovery requests etc.  We also
discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to
help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for
which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time.  In other
words, since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any
analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup
tapes.
Tim Belden
 FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date
of December 25th.  He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter.
FERC Reporting
 A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to
FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps.  This was a
requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on
December 8th.  The order granting the relief did not seem to include the
reporting requirement.  The first cut at the data for the report showed that
Enron made $1.0M over a weekend by buying power at $500 and selling at $700.
A later cut at the data came up with a different answer.  When consulted by
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall, I made the unilateral decision not to file
the report.  It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen
and did not trust the data.  Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we
did not need to file the report.  However, beginning January 12th this
report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap.  Since this report
requires a breakdown of costs vs. sales price, it is the same data that the
PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the
litigation.  Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting
method.
Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO
 Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating
officer of the ISO requesting a job.  Apparently the COO and the current ISO
board are not getting along.  The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and
Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire.  One of the key
issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire.  Obviously,
Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person.  Also, if
this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his
testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased.  On
the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was
employed by Enron that could be harmful.  There is also the question raised
whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives
could be in play.  Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday.  He has
instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and
that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team.
Potential for Criminal Investigation
 The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised
questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of
personal liability for them (civil or criminal).  I reported that all we
know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney
General.  We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on
Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target.  I said that at this stage
of the investigation (including our investigation) we do not know enough
facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees.  We have not reviewed
the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes.  If we learn of
facts that are specific to an employee, Mark has asked that we notify him
immediately.  We did provide some of this same information to traders we
interviewed early in the process.
Analysis of EPMI data
 I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a
daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to
EPMI's.  The source of the data is public information that was available to
decision makers at the time.  The comparison shows that generally speaking
the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of 5-10 times the amount
that EPMI was out of balance.  There are some exceptions, but those are
rare.
Approaching Federal Judge for More Time
 Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the
assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San
Diego would be in the best position to make the motion.
Holiday Contact List
 Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of
you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and
schedule over the holiday period.  I will have a composite list made up and
distributed.

Thanks
Gary

Richard,

As requested, I have prepared a draft letter to be sent to Four-Four, Inc. 
demanding payment of the subcontractors immediately.  Also attached for your

future communications in the matter to you.  When I updated Barbara Gray on 
the matter she suggested that you handle the communications with the 
subcontractors' attorney.  According to the subcontractors' attorney a 
response is demanded by Friday March 24th.  If I can be of any further 
assistance please let me know.  I will forward the file on this matter 
immediately.  

 

Thanks,

I figure that the draft engagement letter between Enron and AGSK got pretty
far down in your piles these last several weeks, so I am taking the liberty of
attaching the current draft to this e-mail.  This matter is sufficiently
significant that we really should have a memorialization of the terms of our

14  LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items 
of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron 
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such 
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse 
impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in 
Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company 
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and
Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or 
royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of 
which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into 
two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first 
matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the "Panhandle program," a 
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was 
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In 
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 
to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain 
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with 
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court 
ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded 
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' 
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute 
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and 
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no 
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or 
results of operations.

   On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto 
Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in 
fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding 
property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, 
operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not 
provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and 
their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third 
parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, 
Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed 
in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court 
of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, 
business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  
After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all 
parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these 
suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was 
injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages 
attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for 
settlements or
final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can 
be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of 
operations.

   Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial 
operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The OPUC granted 
PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent 
of its remaining investment in Trojan.

   The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to 
litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of 
Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to 
the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens 
Utility Board (CUB).

   In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with CUB and the staff of the 
OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in 
the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, CUB agreed to withdraw from the 
litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan 
litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the 
settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's 
investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, 
either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of 
ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement 
agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With CUB's withdrawal, URP 
is
the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. URP has 
indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE 
recovery of its investment in Trojan.

   Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances 
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results 
of operations.

   Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require 
expenditures in connection with the
construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for 
remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These 
increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on 
Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur 
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Richard Bianchi has proposed August 20 for the arbitration, which he
believes will not last more than a day..  Does that work for you and our
possible witnesses,if any? Short of the offtakers, which Max is concerned
about involving, who would you have in mind--since we are posturing  this
as an msj case?  If the date works, I would suggest that we try to depose
McKenna as soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we
really need. Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the
other arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind
of scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.

We have spoken to Alice Gruber, the immigration attorney.  In order for her
to determine if we can get this L-1 transferred, she will need a very basic
diagram of the transactions between these companies.  For example, who
acquired what and at what percentage as well as whether the transactions
were stock based, asset acquisition and/or mergers.

Please send directly to me and I'll work with Alice.

Alice:  with reference to the following, Enron recently made an asset
acquisition of Rudolf Wolf.  We have received the following note from
London:

"Need your help sorting Paul out.  Rudolf Wolf is an MG owned company.
Paul is a UK national, on an L-1 visa obtained by the Rudolf Wolf company.
He is transitioning shortly to an Enron contract, and I'm not sure what we
need to do from an immigration perspective to transition the L-1 visa.

Could you let me know what information the lawyers will need, so that I can
get the ball rolling."

Please let me know whether it is possible to bring Paul Fingster over on an
L1 given the fact that Enron did not do a stock transfer?

Many thanks

Sorry, I have been out on vacation.  Before I call Ingrid, I just wanted to
see if you found out anything on your trip to NY.  MG MCC should have
immigration attorneys who assist with their visa filings and should be able
to coach her.  I am nervous about coaching her as we have a law firm handle
all our visa issues.  Because each case may be different, we have the law
firm speak with each individual to determine the best route to take, then
they complete all the paperwork and we sign.

Hi, Jane!

I talked to Ingrid Krinke again today.  Ingrid is the HR person at MG MCC,
the New York branch of MG plc.  MG plc has acquired Rudolph Wolff, another
British company.  Rudolph wolfe has the two H1 and one L1 visa employees.
It turns out that MG plc is doing an asset acquisition of Rudolph Wolff,
not a stock transfer, and Ingrid's immigration attorney tells her that they
cannot transfer an L1 in an asset transfer.  Ingrid is starting the process
of transferring the H1's from RW to MG.  I do not know how much ingrid
knows about visas, and it would probably be good if we guided her so that
she does not so something that impacts us or that is unnecessary.

Ingrid has a thick file of immigration "stuff" on these folks but she does
not know what to send to us.  Could you give her a call and talk to her
about the situation?  I am concerned that i am not asking her the right
questions, or I may garble the info when I pass it on to you.  Ingrid is at
212.715.5241.  I told her that you might call.

closing is forecast for Sept. 8; i may be in NY either this monday or the
following monday collecting data.  I would be happy to sit with you and
tell you what I know , or join in on the call to ingrid.  Please ring me.
713.345.7801

Thanks a bunch.

		 Subject: DOJ - Memo to File - Range of Market Values  



Pearson's June 9, 2000 letter questions why $.10 or $.11 were deducted from
the Transco and Koch indices in connection with the sale of Mobile Bay Block
870 gas.

We responded in detail on October 3.  In addition to those answers, we
should keep in mind that market value cannot necessarily be calculated with
mathematical precision.  Market value is often described in terms of a
range.  Indeed, the Inside FERC's Gas Market Reports publishes not only an
index price, but also a range of prices for each pipeline pricing point.

In looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the
sample months, it is clear that, if $.10 or $.11 were deducted from the
index price, then the resulting price would still be in the range as
published by Inside FERC.

For example, in December 1996, the Transco Zone 3 index price was $3.82.
The published range was $3.38 to $3.95.  So adjusting the index by 10 cents
still keeps you well within the range.

Similarly, for the 1996 Koch So. La. index.  The index price was $3.82.  The
range was $3.55 to $3.94.  Again, an 11 cent adjustment is still well within
the range.

A quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower,
and the adjustments would take you outside the range.  Nonetheless, we
should keep this background information in mind in case Justice continues to
pursue this point.

If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to 
the control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue 
that although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, 
Enron has no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of 
winning?

 By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to 
comment on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

Do you think we should appeal Entergy source and sink FERC order?  While I 
think it is a poorly written order that shows a lack of understanding of the 
issue, I'm not sure that we can win on appeal or that it is worth appealing, 
since we would not recover our damages against ComEd and TVA for this summer 
while the order is in effect.  It would be helpful next summer to be able to 
park in ComEd and TVA, since the RTOs will not be running in all likelihood.  

Elizabeth/Richard -- Is there a reason in the TVA litigation  that we need to 
appeal the decision?

Otherwise, Joe, should we get Dan W. to draft a memo on chances of success or 
other reasons for filing an appeal?

Mr. Sanders:

We have received a telephone call from Kevin of Frontier Economics regarding 
outstanding invoices they currently have with respect to Project Stanley.

Kevin indicated that there are three invoices now issued and outstanding (the 
earliest dated back to July) and he is wondering when they might expect 
payment of the invoices.

Can you give me any idea as to when the accounts will be paid?  I believe 
Frontier Economics was looking for payment by direct wire if possible.

I sent a letter last week enclosing a $100,000 check as reimbursement of
an overpayment.  Did you get it?

I should have asked whether we could apply $9,563.84 of it to the old
"counseling" bills I have never been able to get paid.  Recall I went
through those and figured out which unit, etc. they applied to.  Some
were re the Sports Authority, some were re emplyment contracts, etc.
They still haven't ever been paid.  It would be nice to clean this up too.

Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Thanks
Gary

I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your 
voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being 
handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next 
week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, 
I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business 
contact--a short and sweet letter should do.

Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one.

In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista 
manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction 
tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of 
interest.  

It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes 
for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the 
declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, 
how would you like to go about making the request?

report to me;  

" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "

9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.

I have been buried with your state's energy crisis and have not had a chance

Richard - Do you have any comments on the draft engagement letter that I 
faxed to you
last week?

A reminder that Roland and I are currently scheduled to have dinner with Brian
Barth on the evening of 2/7 and to meet with him all day on 2/8.  (there is
some possibility that we may ask Brian to roll this schedule one day, since I
may still be in SF in the deposition of Bill Mellin of Farallon thru 2/7
althought I am hoping to get out of SF at the end of the day on 2/6.)

Do you want to be involved in our meetings with Brian?

Those things are such a waste of time- trying to condense 8 points of error 
and 6 weeks of trial in a 20 minute argument. Bill did a very good job. The 
opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did 
not go over well. Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. 
law. Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument. I 
personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union. The 
remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas 
purchase agreement between Union and the utility district. In short, you 
didn't miss much.

FYI,  I need to send something to Helm for not lifting under their contract


Helm US Chemical Corporation
1110 Centennial Avenue
Piscataway,  NJ  08854

Ref: Contract no. NB4680.1
 Deal No. HLC00(TS)0002

Marcus Dahlman

While we have offered you additional time to perform under the said contract 
you still have not responded.  In the event that Helm US Chemical Corp. 
decides not to lift the contracted 1,000 m/tons Styrene Monomer Enron will be 
forced to take legal action for failure to fulfill the obligation set fourth 
by the contract.

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting 
convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the 
litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Bob --

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on 
accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.

You have chosen to enroll in the Enron PAC.  You should have received a 
confirmation e-mail which you must respond to, as your new contribution 
election will not take effect without an electronic signature as outlined by 
the Federal Election Commission.  As soon as we receive confirmation from 
you, your enrollment will take effect the next available payroll period.

Thank you for your participation in the Enron PAC.

Richard: 

It was another great deposition day for the plaintiffs.? The high point was 
an audio taped phone conversation of Max Holmes' calling Stickler a liar.? A 
more detailed report is attached.

Frankly, I don't think McDonald and NatWest can let this case go to trial.? 
They will almost surely lose, and lose big, and PaineWebber could be drawn in 
too.? I think I will make a renewed pitch to Bruce MacLeod (Farallon's lawyer 
here this week) to let ECT out.? I will keep you posted.

I have shown the two playscapes that I have picked out for everyone to look
at.  I faxed to Richard, mailed to Doug and John, and Steve looked at it at
my house.  Obviously, there are much more fancy ones....and more money.  And
there are cheaper ones....that you can buy at Sam's or other warehouses and
put up yourself......

However, I picked out two that could go with our fort and sandbox out there
and really provide the swinging and climbing part of the playscape.  It was
affordable and they come out and set it up.

I would like to order soon.  They can have it too the Perd in about three
weeks.  So, please tell me what you think.

The simpler one is about 220 per family, and the bigger one is about 280 per
family.

Talk to you soon.

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.

Richard,  we have heard nothing definitive.  The clerk at Brick Court 
Chambers did mention recently that due to backlog at the court we may not get 
there until May of 2001, but we certainly cannot rely on that.  The new term 
opens October 1, so in principle we could go any time after that date.  I am 
predicting toward the end of 1Q 2001.

Have you heard anything about the schedule for the hearing in the CATS 
appeal? I need to travel to London soon and I would like to attend.

Subject: Travel Announcement

The recently announced "new" deep discounts on the upfront purchase price of 
airline tickets with our preferred air carriers booked through the Travel 
Agency in the Park have been well received!

Increased airline ticket bookings with our preferred carriers was expected in 
the Enron Houston offices.  The response from the Enron business units 
outside the Houston area has been remarkable.  As a result, call volume to 
TAP has increased by 30%.

As a result of this 30% increase in call volume, TAP continues to add 
qualified, experienced agents to their staff to meet the increased needs of 
Enron travelers.

If your "Enron Business Unit/Location" was not previously using TAP for your 
airline bookings, please contact Tracy Ramsey, Enron Corporate Travel 
Manager, 713/853-6457 to assist you with your transition process to TAP.

This transition process will include items such as setting-up Traveler 
Profiles in the TAP system to expedite the booking process and establishing 
your travel patterns so that TAP can respond to your specific travel needs 
and requirements.

The Travel Agency in the Park has established a web site, 
http://www.travelpark.com, that is available to you for browsing flight 
schedules and booking flights.

Thank you for our support of the Enron Travel Program that continues to 
provide exceptional cost savings to Enron Corp.

Please contact Tracy Ramsey, 713/853-6457 if you have questions or comments.

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/

		 Subject: Arbitration Provision

In a development agreement for a power plant in Connecticut, I have included 
what I believe to be our standard ENA arbitration/damages limitation 
provision, that contains a provision stating that ENA and counterparty shall 
each designate an arbitrator, " who need not be neutral", within 30 days 
after receiving notification of the filing for the demand for arbitration. 
The originators on the transaction are adamantly opposed to the quoted 
language because it is "not standard" ENA arbitration language, is an affront 
to our counterparty, and "could screw up the transaction" if I insist leaving 
it in the document. I have pointed out it is applicable to our and our 
counterparty's designee, and is intended to ensure we get at least one 
sympathetic or at least knowledgeable participant on the panel that could be 
persuasive to the panel as a whole. I also said I thought the deletion of the 
quoted language would give the counterparty the right to challenge a 
"non-neutral" designee under the rules of the AAA and throw the whole 
designation process up in the air ( I'm not sure that is right). Given the 
strident objections, do you think we materially prejudice our rights by 
removal of the quoted language, and if so, can you give me some greater 
ammunition to use with my originators? Thanks for your assistance.

 Although it is always a moving target when you try to interpret Randy's 
e-mails, when he says "more realistic" numbers, I think he is talking to you. 
I thought I heard that 1) Sterling's case was weak and 2) she has hired a 
more reasonable atty.

As you know there are a couple of pending litigation issues outstanding 
(Waste Management, Lyon Credit/Hudson United Bank and Victoria Sterling).  
Per conversations w/ Richard Sanders he suggests setting aside $25K each for 
WMI and Lyon Credit.  Michelle suggested $250-300K for Sterling.

Based on our cash available and expense projections these reserves bankrupted 
us about two weeks ago!  I need further guidance on more realistic numbers.  
We don't have much room to work here and every dollar is precious to keep the 
lights on while we try and get this sale done.

Subject: Legal Assistant Position & Reference Request


Dear Richard and Michelle:

Attached to this e-mail is a copy of my resume and a cover letter that I have
forwarded to Ms. Nedre Strambler with Enron's Human Resources department in
an attempt to find a Legal Assistant position there at Enron.  As you know I
was
Carrin Patman's paralegal for several years over at Bracewell & Patterson and
I
am hoping that I might be able to use the two of you as references should I
be contacted regarding the positions I've applied for.

Richard, in the Beeson matter I see that the Supreme Court rendered a
decision in Intratex's favor regarding the necessity of a new trial if
the Plaintiffs attempt to recertify the class. As I assume you are aware, I
was the person in charge of assembling and organizing all 1200 boxes of
documents relating to the various Intratex, HPL, Atapco, Beeson and Mills
matters and assisted Carrin and Neal Manne in many of the court appearances.
I believe that this experience can be very useful if I were to work for Enron.

Michelle, even though I only had an opportunity to work on a couple of your
projects while you were at B&P, I did have an opportunity to assist you and
others at Enron with the urgent project to produce employment records to the
FTC last fall. I really enjoyed working with you and would like to do so
again.

Any assistance you can offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I know you have worked hard on this so I hate to start with a 
complaint........but this announcement is not the greatest. First, there is

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

1)confirming your requests re Wisvest and 2)  outling you information

		 Subject: MEMO TO FILE: Wisvest Discussions and Ecogas SA

On Friday, August 4 JB and I had a discussion re: engaging Wisvest in a 
dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the San Antonio project.  
In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8/2/00 Board 
meeting which was:  a) we needed to finalize the numbers re: the WMI royalty 
renegotiation; b) verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project; c) 
revise the project pro-forma to reflect the revisions in (a) and (b) and d) 
run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to 
accept in order to make the project economics viable.  In our phone 
conversation on 8/4/00 we again agreed this was the right course of action to 
take.  Subsequent to that call, JB had conversations w/ Derek Price at 
Wisvest re: prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re: the 
project.  In another phone conversation on Monday, August 7, I specifically 
asked JB whether he had sent the project pro-formas and/or other proprietary 
info to Derek Price to which JB responded "no."  He said he "... sent him 
summary info ... but did NOT send him the pro-forma ..."  I then asked him to 
forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek.  What he sent to me 
was some very basic e-mails and financial summary info.  I also asked Derek 
to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more, 
including the full-blown project model/pro-forma.  This has seriously 
diminished all of our negotiating leverage!

On 8/10/00, I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in 
setting up a South American version of Ecogas (Ecogas S.A.) and called him to 
inquire as to what was going on.  In our phone conversation JB explicitly 
denied "any involvement" including any "ownership" in such an enterprise.  I 
also asked JB to forward to me by Friday, 8/11/00, copies of any and all 
documents, agreements, etc... relating to Ecogas S.A.  To date he has sent me 
nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless 
correspondence (undated and/or old e-mails, etc...).  None of the info sent 
is what I asked for on August 4 (complete execution copies of the MOU 
regarding Ecogas S.A. including ownership interests, etc... as well as copies 
of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S.A., etc...Who is Ecogas S.A.?  
Where is it currently incorporated?  Who are the beneficial owners?  Under 
what authority are you transacting business (what is your title, etc...)  JB 
continues to reference "nothing has been signed, incorporated, etc..." - then 
why is JB's signature evidenced on an "Amendment" to the "Memorandum of 
Understanding:  Ecogas S.A. - Tortola/JCS"?  

JB referenced the need to "directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis, 
rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness."  For the past 
couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets, 
greenhouse gas emission credits, etc...  To the best of my knowledge Ecogas 
has yet to see one penny!

As always there seems to be a direct contradiction between the "stories" and 
the facts!

I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make 
Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for 
depositions. Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel 
Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk 
them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview 
with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this.

		 Subject: Enron v. Calpine


 Andy:

 To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

 I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
"working on" getting me a reply.

 We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

 Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

 I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

 Best regards,

 Bill

 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in 
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our 
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar 
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % 
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, 
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, 
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim 
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do 
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt

THIS IS A CONFIDENTIAL E-MAIL COMMUNICATION FROM BRACEWELL &
PATTERSON, L.L.P.  IF YOU RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL BY MISTAKE, PLEASE
DELETE IT BEFORE READING, AND CALL ANDY TAYLOR AT
(512)472-7800.  THANK YOU.

Wollschlager Team:
I took depositions Monday and Tuesday of Wollschlager's expert, David
Cotner, and the two pumpers, Royce and Devon Creager (Father / son
team).  Cotner did nothing but plug numbers into spreadsheets for
Wollschlager, and did not apply any of his engineering or gas contract
expertise to his analysis.  He did not  analyze the contract, amendments
or the dealings between the parties (such as price amendments,
Panhandle program releases, etc.), for purposes of his damage
calculations.  He did not evaluate the true delivery capacity of the well,
but relied totally on Wollschlager's assessment.  He admitted that he would 
not be comfortable submitting the calculations
he performed to a court of law as a valid damages claim, because he
has not reviewed the contract to see what the pricing, take-or-pay,
credits, force-majeure, etc. provisions are, and he agreed that those
types of issues must be included to present a valid contract damages
claim.  We are drafting a motion to exclude his testimony and
calculations.

Royce Creager (mid-late 60's) was the pumper who pumped the well in
1983 when the "event" occurred.  He remembered driving up to the well
the morning after the equipment failure (we're not calling it a blowout - it
was a failure of the operator's equipment).  He noticed something
strange, and then realized that the "stack-pack" (heater and separation
equipment) was not there.  He first thought someone must have stolen it,
and then he saw the broken flowline, pointing up in the air, and 
 of the
"stack pack" about 200 ft. away in one direction, and the other half of the
equipment about 200 ft. away in the other direction!  He does not
remember any gas flowing out of the flowline, and he's sure he would
remember it if the gas had been flowing to the atmosphere.  (Logical
conclusion:  when the equipment failed and blew up, the emergency
shut-down valve on the wellhead did what it was supposed to, and shut
the well in, to prevent any damage to the wellbore or waste of gas, by
shutting off the flow of gas.)

He has absolutely no recollection of the well being shut in prior to the
failure, and no recollection of Intratex's rate requests in general.  He
agreed that it is the operator's (his) responsibility to carefully monitor the
flow of gas from a well being brought back on-line after it has been
shut-in, to make sure no damage occurs.

His son, Devon Creager, has been  pumping the well since early 1985,
and generally has no knowledge or memory of any facts relevant to the
case.  However, he does not know of anything unusual about the well's
production since that time, except that it has gradually declined in
production, which is what he would expect with any gas well.

Wollschlager's deposition is scheduled for September 14.

I am contacting Harper Estes today, to get possible dates for the elusive
mediation.  Judge Gilles called me today (after talking to Morgan) to see if
we needed his help to get a mediation scheduled.  I thanked him and told
him I thought we would be able to schedule a mutually agreeable date,
but told him we may call him next week if we needed him to "help" us.

Stay tuned . . . Andy Taylor

In connection with a series of FASB 125 transactions, ENA will be entering 
into several swap transactions.  Also in connection therewith, Mark H. will 
be asked to deliver an opinion that there is no litigation which could impair 
ENA's ability to perform under the swaps.  Do you know of any reason why we 
could not deliver this opinion?  The opinion will be dated sometime on or 
prior to quarter end.

David,

Where are we?  I am out on vacation all next week, and haven't sent the 
below-referenced bills to Richard yet, as I do not want to bother Richard 
with approving them piece-meal.  I trust that you will shortly be receiving 
payment from underwriters and do not want to I delay getting you authority 
for netting out what Enron agrees it owes.  I greatly appreciate your 
immediate help.

1.  Please press whoever owes us their outstanding bills to get them to us as 
soon as possible.

2.  With regard to the Minton's bills, can you get me an itemized breakdown?

3.  With regard to the barrister's fees, can we get something that will allow 
us to determine how much time/what billing rate applies to each of these 
entries?  I am mindful and appreciative that he apparently hasn't billed us 
in four years.

4.  With regard to the arbitrator's fees and expenses, is any more detail 
available (total time spent/rate)?

Many thanks for your immediate help.

Britt

I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer. 
I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case 
attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise 
separate this company from Mother Enron.

Richard,
In connection with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company, we are transferring 
ownership in the above-referenced companies from HPL to an entity now named 
LOA, Inc. which, until closing of the HPL sale, is a wholly owned sub of HPL. 
At, or just prior to closing, that ownership will be transferred to Enron 
Corp. since these companies are excluded assets. There is a note in the Corp. 
Secretary's records that indicates no mergers or consolidations of assets of 
these entities should take palce without Bob Williams approval. I am assuming 
that now means you and I do not believe the transfer of the stock qualifies 
as either a merger or a consolidation. However, since I believe the issue 
centers around pending or threatened litigation I thought I would pass this 
along in the event you needed to know or had an issue with it. Please let me 
know ASAP if you do--I am making the conveyance effective February 28th

Thanks,
Sandi

Bill McCartney at V&E, you should know that I am also sending him a copy.

Richard, in the future, could you please have your Assistant forward the 
reports to me.  Previously, Mr. Derrick did not have e-mail and his mail was 
diverted to me automatically by the system.  Now, it does go to him and I 
have to go in and send it back to me.  Mr. Derrick reads the reports after I 
take care of the administration of them which involves copying, filing and 
forwarding on to Vinson & Elkins.  This is the procedure he has set for me.  

I don't mean to complicate your life further, but would really appreciate it 
if you could do this.  

Thanks so much,

Steph.

Interoffice
Memorandum

Enron's performance has been exceptional.  This performance is reflected in=
=20
our stock price, in the recognition we receive in the media and financial=
=20
communities, and, most importantly, in the enthusiasm of our people.  It ha=
s=20
been clear to us for some time that we are driving fundamental change in th=
e=20
marketplace and that our natural gas, electricity and communications networ=
ks=20
can be positioned for even greater growth.  A =01&new economy=018 is emergi=

economy based on intellectual capital and the compelling economics of=20
networks.  Capturing the opportunities in this new economy calls for=20
increased coordination and integration across our wholesale (ECT, ECM, EI),=
=20
retail (EES), and communications (ECI) businesses.  It is our intention to=
=20
combine the operations of these businesses into a cohesive organization tha=
t=20
will ensure we realize the growth we foresee in all our businesses.

To this end, we are initiating a number of organization and staffing change=
s=20
in these businesses and related changes in the Enron Office of the Chairman=
,=20
in Corporate Staff groups, and in a number of management/personnel=20
committees.  Other business units, EOG, GPG, PGE, and Azurix, will not be=
=20
directly affected.  Accordingly, the following changes are effective=20
immediately.

Enron Office of the Chairman

Joe Sutton will join the Office of the Chairman as Vice Chairman.  In his n=
ew=20
role, Joe will work with the two of us to manage the operations of the=20
company. =20

Rebecca Mark, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will now fully=20
concentrate on her responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Azurix, our most=

Directors, effective today.

Ken Harrison, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will fully concentra=
te=20
on his responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Portland General Electric an=
d=20
Non-Executive Chairman of Enron Communications.  Ken will continue to serve=
=20
on Enron's Board of Directors.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses=
=20
and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an=20
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation=
=20
and performance review across all units.  Each global function will provide=
=20
its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these=
=20
functions is a new technology function, which will focus on information=20
systems and growth of our e-commerce capabilities where we believe there is=
=20
enormous potential.  These organizational units and their leadership are as=
=20
follows:

 Regions/Businesses

 North America:  Cliff Baxter, CEO; Kevin Hannon, COO
 Europe:  Mark Frevert, CEO; John Sherriff, President; Dan McCarty, COO
 South America: Jim Bannantine, Co-CEO; Diomedes Christodoulou, Co-CEO
 India:  Sanjay Bhatnagar, CEO
 Caribbean, Middle East:  David Haug, CEO
 Asia, Africa:  Rebecca McDonald, CEO
 EES:  Lou Pai, CEO; Tom White, Vice Chairman
 ECI:  Joe Hirko, Co-CEO; Ken Rice, Co-CEO (Ken Harrison =01) non-executive=

 Global Functions

 Risk Management:  Greg Whalley, CEO
 Finance:  Andy Fastow, CFO; Jeff McMahon, Treasurer
 Asset Operations:  Kurt Huneke, CEO
 EE&CC:  Larry Izzo, CEO
 Technology:  Mike McConnell, CEO

Corporate Staff

All corporate and EI staff units will be regrouped into six corporate staff=
=20
groups.  These staff groups will support all operations of Enron.  These=20
organizational units and their leadership are as follows:

 Legal:  Jim Derrick, EVP and General Counsel; Rob Walls, SVP and Deputy=20
General Counsel
 Risk Assessment and Control:  Rick Buy, EVP
 Accounting and HR:  Rick Causey, EVP and Chief Accounting Officer
 Investor Relations:  Mark Koenig, EVP
 Other Staff Groups:  Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff
 Corporate Development:  To be determined.

Committees

A new Executive Committee will be formed to replace the existing Management=
=20
and Operating Committees.  Membership will be as follows:

 Ken Lay, Chairman
 Jeff Skilling, Alternate Chairman
 Joe Sutton
           Stan Horton
Jim Bannantine         Kurt Huneke
 Cliff Baxter         Larry Izzo

Andy,
I need to make disclosure on any threatened or pending litigation against BAM 
Lease Company or any other party affecting the Leased Facilities. The Leased 
Facilities are the Houston, Bammel and Texas City Loops and the Bammel 
Storage Facility including the compressor sites and compressors as well as 
meters. Currently the Leased Facilities are leased by HPL Assets Holdings LP 
to BAM as assignee of HPL. BAM will be leasing the Leased Facilities back to 
HPL under the sublease. Can you let me know if there is any threatened or 
pending litigation involving these entities or assets specifically--as always,
 I appreciate your help--

Sandi

This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!"  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

all the attys on the list--a daunting task. The suggestion of outlining

I wanted to make sure you are aware of this since it may be an ECT issue.  
This is a very minor case ($60K) and the only reason Enron is a named 
defendant is for an accounting of money paid for this disputed gas.  I am 
trying to figure out whether this is EESI or ECT gas.  Some research so far 
indicates that it may be neither of ours.  I will handle this for now and try 
to get us out of this, unless you have a burning desire to deal with 
Plaintiff's counsel in Marietta, OH.  

Please give me a call at 614-791-6181 if you have any questions.  MDS

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

Hi Richard--

I had dinner with Gilles August, the managing partner of the firm, on 
Friday.  I think his firm is exactly what you are looking for.  They have a 
number of partners who had high level partners in the Government.  However, 
they also have a strong litigation group if that does not work out.  As I 
said last week, their firm patterns itself after US firms.  Gilles himself is 
a member of the New York bar.

I asked Gilles to send you information concerning his firm directly.  Gilles 
tells me that he is going to be in Texas on business sometime soon.  He would 
be happy to stop by and visit with your legal team.

Gina--Will you please e-mail Gilles Richard Sanders contact information, 
including his e-mail address, his office address and phone contact 
information.

FYI re: DOJ/CA Situation.  I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the 
upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be 
aware of it.  Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would 
assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely 
to expand to include major marketers.  John

Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time
Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to 
investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among 
power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and 
natural gas prices.

``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the 
electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro 
Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday.

``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion 
and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they 
added.

They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- 
representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, 
allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced 
rolling blackouts.

``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some 
cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate 
their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said.

If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity 
shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural 
gas market.

In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking 
them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced 
power shortages.

Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per 
megawatt hour.

Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a 
new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when 
Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January.

``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take 
immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of 
leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

		 Subject: Citgo pipeline claim

Richard, my larger projects are peaking right now, and Kristina suggested 
that I ask you whether you would like to manage this matter.  

A Citgo gasoline pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor (Wilde 
Construction) last May, near Luling TX.  Citgo has incurred aprox. $700k of 
cleanup costs.   We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo (for failing 
to correctly mark the line), Wilde (for negligently striking the line), and 
Bechtel ( for not being present as our construction manager, knowing that 
Wilde was working near the gasoline line).  The new complication:  The spill 
may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000-odd acres parcel 
affected by the spill.  If that purchase doesn't go through, the attorney for 
the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be 
foreclosed, and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase 
price ($1.3MM) (which I doubt he could fully recover, since he could sell the 
property for some lesser amount).

I am setting up a mediation (of Citgo, Bechtel, and Wilde), where John Odam 
(our atty, with Mangham Hardy) would act as mediator.  The new info about the 
land claim may change that strategy.

Would you like to manage this, or be somewhat involved, or not involved?

Thanks,

Kenton

Richard,

thanks for the voicemail.

We should definitely get together next week. Your assistant can coordinate 
this through mine - Tracy Foy on 44 207 783 7374.

If you are able to speak to the trading lawyers on lessons learnt from 
California, that would be great. Again, Tracy can coordinate.

I attach an org chart showing the lawyers in the group, for your info. Let us 
know if you want to meet up with anyone in particular. 



Litigation we have on going at the moment:

- ICI warranty litigation: legal: Jon Chapman, commercial: Matthew Scrimshaw

- CATS: legal: Mary Nell Browning, commercial: Peter Crilly

- Metals arbitrations: legal: Paul Johnson, commercial: various.

If you want to meet any particular commercial person, we can also broker that.

I'm in your hands. Let me know.



     Mark

I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have 
already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of 
his notifying us about them.  

I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or 
whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no 
interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.

Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the 
Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired 
Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 
minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience.. Some in the 
group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews & 
Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at 
the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this 
regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I 
am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation 
counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If 
that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview 
like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get 
the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the 
group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are 
absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for 
both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to 
talk about this at length.

		 Subject: RE: Participants Committee Counsel


Brian:

With respect to your first point, I will instruct Greenberg Glusker to
modify the footnote regarding McCutcheon Doyle to indicate that the
Committee "will consider supporting" an application under section 503(b).
While the Committee has not yet considered the question, as you point out,
nevertheless we anticipate that McCutcheon Doyle's assistance will be very
helpful in the prosecution of the commandeering litigation.  If that proves
to be true, as I suspect it will, the Committee should not hesitate to
support a section 503(b) application on McCutheon Doyle's behalf at the
appropriate time.

With respect to your second point, one of the primary reasons discussed for
the Committee's decision to hire the Greenberg Glusker firm was the strength
of its litigation group, its experience with "inverse condemnation cases"
and the need to move quickly to control the commandeering litigation.  The
Committee did discuss its concerns regarding the attorneys retained by the
Debtor to handle the commandeering litigation but I do not recall any
reservations or qualifications concerning Greenberg Glusker's prosecution of
the commandeering matter.  During our Committee meetings, Greenberg Glusker
has already reported to the Committee the substantial time and effort it is
devoting to the commandeering matter, along with the McCutcheon firm.  Of
course, it goes without saying in any employment application that the
Committee always reserves its right to change counsel or hire special
counsel when appropriate.  Accordingly, I see no reason to make any changes
to the Greenberg Glusker employment application to address this point.

Please let me know right away if you disagree.  By copy of this email to the
other Committee members, I ask that they also let me know right away if they
disagree.

Thanks for responding quickly.

Howard:

I don't believe the Committee has agreed to recommend that McCutcheon Doyle
be compensated for its "commandeering" litigation support.  I'm not saying
the Committee wouldn't, but we have not taken formal action.

Moreover, the Committee has yet to determine who should prosecute the
"commandeering" claims once the Committee acquires control over them.  Prior
to Greenberg, Glusker's engagement, the Committee determined to reserve for
a later date whether special counsel should be retained.  I believe the
Committee would like to hear from Greenberg, Glusker again a description of
the firm's qualifications in this regard as well as interview other firms
which may be qualified to take on the task.

not previously worked with the legal group.  I spoke to Mike Smith earlier
today about a candidate.  He thought there were probably no needs due to a

On February 14, 2000, Enron North America (Enron) filed a declaratory 
judgment action against the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") in the Federal 
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Chattanooga Division, 
requesting that the court determine whether TVA defaulted under its power 
purchase agreement with Enron by failing to pay undisputed invoices.  On 
March 6, TVA filed a counterclaim against Enron alleging that Enron 
wrongfully terminated the power purchase agreement.  Although no assurances 
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results 
of operations.

		 Subject: Withdrawal from PX Core Market


Richard,
 Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PX
participation agreement in the Core Market:

 1. PX tariff 18.3 says that a participation agreement "may be
terminated by either party upon written notice."

 2. PX tariff 5.3 says with respect to the Core Market
Proportional Charge-Back Methodology:

  "The PX Participant's outstanding default amount will be
charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its
gross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market during
the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month to
date."

  3. PX Participant is a defined term:

  "An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy or
Ancillary Services through the PX, and any agent authorized to act on behalf
of such entity."

  4. Energy is also a defined term:

  "The electrical energy produced, flowing or supplied by
generation, transmission or distribution facilities, being the integral with
respect to time of the instantaneous power, measured in units of watt-hours
or standard multiples thereof, e.g. 1000 Wh.

  5. Ancillary services is also a defined term:

  "Regulation, Spinning Reserve, Non-Spinning Reserve,
Replacement Reserve, Voltage Support and Black start together with such
other interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop in
cooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energy
from Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation of
the ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice."

  Bottom line:

  If a PX Participant, as defined in the PX tariff as opposed
to the PX rate schedule for the CTS market, is an entity that is authorized
to buy or sell "instantaneous power" rather than power in the future, then
Enron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer be
a current PX participant.  Thus, there is an argument that by withdrawing in
writing prior to any chargeback in the core market, that Enron may be able
to argue it cannot be charged back.

  I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution procedures
to see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure and
maintain it.  Schedule 9 section 1.1 states that PX ADR procedures shall
apply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents.
Section 2.1 states that the "PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in good
faith..." It goes on to state in Section 2.2 that "any one of the parties"
may submit a statement of claim.  Thereafter, in Schedule 9 it appears that
the references are to parties not PX Participants.  My quick reading is that
you still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are no
longer a PX Participant.

  Operational Downside:

  Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX to
schedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due?
In other words, if Enron is not a PX Participant, does that mean the PX will
not schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations to
the PX to deliver power?  Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty if
PX  balances its schedule without Enron's power?  I do not know the answer
to this but I am reviewing the tariff.

  Hope this helps
  Thanks
  Gary

Now that Melanie Gray has filed a notice of  appearance on ENA's behalf and 
is receiving copies of notices, pleadings, etc., in the Perry Gas matter, I 
propose that the Litigation Unit no longer process all notices received in 
Perry Gas through our service of process procedures.  Becky Stephens will 
continue to forward copies to me when received, and I will send a copy to you 
of anything that might appear to impact ENA, but, otherwise, we would not 
forward to you copies of notices of appearance and other filings that would 
not appear to directly impact ENA's rights.  Please let me know if this is 
okay with you, and, if it is not, let me know how you would like us to handle 
documents we receive in Perry Gas.  Thanks.

kids don't need anything there. What the house really needs are pots and

but on the Christmas E mail I sent to you...you were the only one that I did
not hear from.  John, Steve, and Doug all thought it was a good idea to
possibly do something for the Perd for the kids.  But I don't want to
continue on that way...if you and Julie were not into that.  So, please tell
me what yall are thinking.  I meant to ask her about it yesterday...but
forgot.

Also, I am trying to do a family homepage for our clan so that the scheduling
of the Perd....would be accessible by Website....so that it is not really
under any one's control.  With Steve moving here....I think that it will work
out better.

By the way, when do yall think you will be going next.  Anytime soon.  We
would love to see yall.

		 Subject: Puget Sound requests NW price caps

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of 
wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties 
to WSPP agreement.  Puget Sound requests FERC to impose price cap on 
wholesale sales of energy and capacity in the Pacific Northwest equal to the 
lowest price cap "established, ordered, or permitted by the Commission for 
wholesale purchases by the Cal ISO or Cal PX . . . ."  Puget requests an 
effective date of December 25,2000.

We could agree to non exclusive jurisdiction in Tenn., but not exclusive 
jurisdiction.  As for the arbitration forum, my preference would be a major 
regional metro area--Atlanta comes to mind.

		 Subject: TEPAC Distributors Agreement

Recapping our call w/ Keith Simmons (TEPAC's outside counsel) this afternoon, 
we still have the following issues to resolve (the first three are the most 
important to TEPAC).
(1)  Subrogation against TVA -- Keith doubts that TEPAC would ever agree to 
Section 4.5, despite our expressed need to be able to challenge TVA directly 
on its cut of energy we attempt to deliver or its calculation of Replacement 
Costs.  Keith suggested that Jason and Phil speak directly to Larry Hamilton 
about this subject, and they will attempt to do that soon.  
(2)  Mitigation Duty --  They are not comfortable w/ a duty to mitigate 
Replacement Cost damages that are calculated by TVA b/c they cannot foresee 
circumstances where any action or failure to act could have any impact on 
those damages.  We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have every 
incentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.  They might 
be willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.  
(3)  EPMI's Cover Damages --  They are not very comfortable agreeing to the 
concept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannot 
imagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an "into" 
product such as this.  We both agreed to reconsider this.
(4)  Criteria for Enron's rejection of Distributor -- Our right to approve 
Distributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from being 
arbitrary about those approvals.  We agreed.
(5)  Notice of changes to underlying agreements -- Their duty to notify us it 
ok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributor 
agreements, which don't absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPAC 
everything.  We agreed.
(6)  Request for offers --  They would prefer that EPMI call them every day 
w/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiate 
the process.  We described this as our normal way of doing business and they 
agreed.
(7)  Indemnity clause -- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifying 
the other while they have title to the power, which had been included in our 
earlier draft.  I agreed to look into this.  
(8)  Governing Law and Arbitration -- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer 
including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in 
Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   
They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.  We both 
agreed to reconsider this.  Richard:  What do you think about that?

Any comments are welcome.

Regards,
Janice

That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually

 He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.  
 What happened at the meeting on Monday with Mark?  Do I still have a job?

Subject: Mid-C control area abuse

Sean and I talked through the Mid-C control area abuse (Puget and WWP's 
refusal to honor Mid-C sales not sunk at Mid-C) with Dan Watkiss of Bracewell 
Patterson.  After "sinking" his mind into the facts, Dan was of the view that 
a two pronged legal approach could be taken:   1.  take one of our apparently 
frequent direct purchases  from Puget at Mid-C as  a test case and when Puget 
refuses to honor the schedule which requires it to be sunk at COB, sue them 
in a state court,  and 2.  bring a complaint against Puget at Ferc allegding 
conduct in breach of the Federal Power Act.    There is enough wrong about 
this situation to cause Dan to say that both actions were potentially 
available.    The real issue now is,  do we want to disrupt our business 
relationship with Puget and WWP by taking either or both of these actions?  
Let's discuss this, and Richard,  I apologize for not getting to you with 
this already, but will call you and discuss it right away.----cgy

John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David 
Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, 
learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. 
I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the 
Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a 
release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a 
Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in 
Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position 
in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?

I think it would be worth pursuing that option with your client.  If it
meant the involvement of your firm (to any significant extent), the
plaintiffs would likely agree to dismiss the Enron defendants.

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders.

I had some problems with the atty at Vinson & Elkins who I sent your file to 
originally. I sent it to Josh McMorrow at Bracewell & Patterson. He will be 
up to speed on Monday-- he is doing his homework on the corporate entities 
today. His telephone # is 713-223-2900.

it looks as though we overwithheld about usd 80k that is now due colonial

(1) against their invoice to us of usd 1,089,379.26 i believe we paid them 
usd 839,379.26 shortpaying them usd 250k exactly correct Tomas?

(2) we sent colonial documentation (feb 12, 1999 fax from Tomas) showing that 
we estimated that they  owed us usd 132,752.92 for the barging on the first 
(and subsequently only) lifting from colonial to pge correct Tomas?

(3) however we subsequently found  that we incurred usd 161,406.59 in total 
costs as evidenced by leskowitz's spreadsheet dtd 8/23/99 right Mark?

Chad, Mark, Tomas: can you pls confirm that we would therefore owe Colonial 
usd 88,590 correct?

Why don't I start sending you a brief e-mail every Friday summarizing
activities in the case for that week and what is coming up soon.  Nothing
fancy or time consuming, just a brief update

For example:

Today:

          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have to
disclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even about
March 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of
counsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred ruling
whether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998
concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find out
what this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)

          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by
Natwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don't think
Natwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am not
planning for  ECT Securities to take a position.

          (3)  We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, after
removing a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch's
statement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT
Securities.

Later this week:

        Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY.
 I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or not
say, about ECT Securities.


Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (and
also her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enron
for something concerning related party transactions?

Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of
all the CEOs of the "generators".   This request has come through Julie
Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm,
Edson and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I
asked her to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.
If Burton comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.

Richard:  actually, it is pretty clear.  We definitely would never file any 
papers without running them through you.  But on drafts of papers should we 
get your clearance first before sending to ECP or should we send out drafts 
to each of you simultaneously.  I assume the latter.  Could you let me know 
if you think differently.  Thanks, Richard, and I'm sure we will be speaking 
soon.  John

Yes. I am the contact person at Enron. The LLGM attys should send me copies
of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers,
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As
for contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them
directly for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made
through me. I would suggest that they give me the option of participating
on the initial calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because
of time constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

other materials that they may need, but please let me know if you would
rather that they work through you.  Thanks, Richard.  I hope that all is

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.
/ / /
  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk? He was the attorney from 
Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month. All of the comments I 
recieved were very positive. The last I heard, you were talking to him about 
salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation 
level. Please let me know what I should do to follow up.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the 
issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial 
lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Sorry to hear that you have yet not successfully off loaded your duties of
as unofficial secretary of the group.

Andy, not me, will be the Enron representative on the Steering Committee.  I
had subbed at a meeting 10 or so days ago because Richard Sanders had been
tied up on an extended project.  Andy will handle it from this point
forward.

I will ask Andy to copy you on the information that he sends to Tom
Nicholas.

Hope you have a nice holiday.

Charles -

Did you mean that you also wanted to participate on the Wright Steering
Committee ?  Our approach has been that only in-house counsel will
participate;  it is only in the event that an in-house attorney is unable to
participate on the committee that outside counsel has been proxied in.
Please advise.

Could you also have Andy cc: me on his E-mail to Tom forwarding his contact

been maintaining updated information for the groupl.

MidAmerican agrees that it is inappropriate to form an official ratepayers

Subject: CalPX Participants' Committee - possible joinder in PGE motion
re ratepayers committee


To: CalPX Participants' Committee

Howard Weg has asked that I poll the committee members because several 
members of the committee have advised that they believe we should take a 
position supporting PG&E's motion to vacate the UST's appointment of a 
Ratepayers' committee in the PG&E bankruptcy case.  The idea is to file a 
brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, 
representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 
billion in claims against PG&E, as scheduled by PG&E in
its list of 20 largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed 
by the PG&E creditors' committee.  Our joinder would state that there is no 
statutory basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in 
the best interest of the estate.  We might also indicate that we agree with 
PGE and the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for 
ratepayers to be heard which make more sense than giving them official 
committee status.  We would also appear telephonically
at the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on 
this issue.  Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to 
the committee taking this position.

Thank you.

Richard, Judge Link said that he would fax us his rulings by Noon today
(Wednesday).  I would not hold my breath.  CFP has agreed to be on the
lookout for a fax (I will be in a hearing in Dallas) and to let us all know
by voice messages as soon as she receives something.  Let's keep Knox's
fingers crossed....

I think the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the UC/CSU contract in the

briefing John Lavarato later this week.  Bob, can you bring Richard up to

The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases. She 
sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another. One day I'm sitting at the 
house on Tosca when the phone rings. Its her. She must have seen my name on a 
list of residents. She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on 
the loose in the area before. Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and 
with less kids, I was in the yard all the time. I knew the stray dogs. I told 
her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they 
had a dog. Needless to say I never heard from her again.

How about 1:30 p.m. your time, or any time after that? 

The Baltimore meeting won't happen, but there is some background.? That's one

This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas
royalty
cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before Judge
Hannah.
Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a defendant.  Both
cases
are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The allegations are
similar to
those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil
Oil
Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing
Southeast,
Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and Mobil
Exploration and Producing U.S.

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs
are
Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, WI.
The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production
Company,
Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of
Houston,
signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker
told
me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped as
defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were
named
in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again named
as
defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed on June
13,
2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the plaintiffs, had a
conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron and EOG to
preserve
the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 13 complaint is
not
yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.

Subject: Cargo/Storage Claim - Styrene at Baytank


I spoke to the head adjuster Sharron West this morning regarding this claim.  
She has discussed same with their chemist Bob Ash.

Sharron has reached some conclusions that are far different from the claim 
which was submitted to her.  From our conversation, the main differences seem 
to be:

1.  She is calculating the claim using the basis of valuation in the Philco 
contract.  That basis of valuation seems to coincide with your monthly 
storage declarations.   Your calculations appear to be based more on the spot 
price of the product. I believe the difference is around $.10 per lb which is 
very significant when so many lbs are involved.

2.  There appears to be a discrepancy in the number of pounds involved in the 
claim.  Baytank's records seem to indicate around 2,000,000 lbs. whereas your 
claim references approx. 6,000,000 lbs.   Both Sharron and Bob think that a 
maximum of 4,000,000 lbs. should be considered.

3.  Ancillary charges.  The Enron claim appears to include some Baytank 
charges that are not recoverable, such as tank cleaning, etc.  As a cargo 
policy normally insures against direct physical loss or damage to the product 
itself, there are some charges that are not recoverable under a cargo 
policy.   There also appear to be stock throughput charges in your claim 
through January of 2000, although the product would have been gone by the end 
of November.

At any rate,  based on the valuation of product in the Philco contract (and 
the storage declarations that have been submitted for premium purposes), and 
there being a total of 4,000,000 pounds of product, Sharron has calculateda 
claim in the vicinity of $150,000.  This is obviously a far cry from the 
claim submitted of around $900,000+.   Of course, if you consider a 
difference of $.10 /lb. and apply it to 4,000,000 lbs, you already have a 
difference of $400,000.  If you then factor in the difference between 
6,000,000 lbs claimed vs. 4,000,000 lbs. recognized by the adjusters, you 
have another significant sum.

I would be interested in your comments at this point.  If you feel that the 
adjuster has everything wrong, I might suggest that we arrange a meeting and 
go through the claim point by point. This is sometimes the quickedt way to 
resolve major differences.

Please let me know.

Thanks and regards,





Ted Rosen

One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Thanks
Gary

Unless their is a reason having to do with the case( ie we can somehow 
recover our attys fees} I see no reason why we should separate the bills.Send 
me one bill.

Richard: 

Spending a block of time on Busse's deposition this week focuses me on a 
question that we have never really discussed:? How would you like Milbank to? 
allocate its time between the Farallon and Legg-Mason cases?

To date, without really discussing it with you, we have (1) billed the 
Farallon and Legg-Mason cases separately and (2) allocated our time 
specifically relating to each case to that case but allocated "common" time 
entirely to the Farallon case.

Is this what you want? 

Should we just send one bill for the two cases together? 

If we continue separate bills, what should be the allocation principle?? 
Should common time be allocated all to Farallon (the current practice)?? 
divided 50/50 between the two cases?? divided 18/5 between the two cases 
(i.e., allocated by the respective amounts in issue in the two cases) ?

Any thoughts?

I spoke with Gary Grote late this afternoon.  He reiterated that he believed 
that we were very close on the consulting agreement and that he had only 
minor issues with our proposal.  He told me that he would have a written 
response to me before the end of this week, and he agreed that it would be a 
good idea for us to meet with Kevin the week of November 27-December 1.  I 
will let you know when I hear back from him.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Liz/Richard

I suggest that we seek to rely upon Section 18(c) which says that 
"....pending resolution of the disagreement by arbitration, Seller shall 
continue to operate the Plant in a manner consistent with this Agreement and 
Consumers shall continue to pay all charges required in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of this Agreement."
 
Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed 
by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until 
any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each 
stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute 
resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers 
should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few 
years.
 
Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with 
a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of 
specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that 
they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute 
resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to 
seek such equitable relief.
 
We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always 
playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be 
out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not 
get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be 
no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them 
to delay any resolution of this dispute.
 
I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of 
documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our 
case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better 
understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made 
against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be 
collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved 
in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Sandy-

I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power
Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the
capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak
= $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus
Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh,
Off Peak = $43.60/MWh.

Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward
it others in your shop.

Thanks,

Ketan

Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if
Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January
2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of
February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should
be sent to Consumers Energy.

In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct
capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and
requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the
correct capacity charge.

Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further.

Kind regards.

Richard, I echo John's desire to have all our ducks lined up to avoid the 
additional $4.5 million funding.  Although this amount is not huge by Enron 
standards, in this case any further funding has no chance of recovery and 
would be an immediate writeoff.  As you know, this "project" has had 
extremely high visibility.  We need to leave no stone unturned!  Thanks.

Subject: Can Fibre Lackawanna

I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default 
under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The 
Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in 
full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, 
etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does 
highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to 
weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with 
respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that 
remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation 
expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not 
replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not 
going to fund.

I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   
Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.  
An analysis would include.

1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make 
sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.  
In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we 
want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put 
them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need 
to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.

2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the 
current default.

3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 
million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).  
By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they 
cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.

Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.

Great!  Now, what have you done for me lately?  The ETS entities are

Thanks for the help on this Andy.  DF

I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the 
plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss 
Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an 
affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us 
know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will 
believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the 
close of business tomorrow.  

I will keep you updated.

Subject: Enron matter 

I have been asked to verify my understanding of Milbank's relationship with 
Enron for a group of Pacific Gas creditors with whom TN has been in 
discussions.? I sent them the following this afternoon:

I spoke with Paul Aronzon, the lead Milbank Tweed partner on the creditors 
committee engagement.? Aronzon said that Milbank Tweed does not represent 
Enron as general counsel or in any other significant capacity.? Enron uses 
Texas counsel when needed, but mostly relies on its very large inhouse legal 
staff.? Milbank Tweed has a large energy practice and works on transactions 
with Enron as lenders counsel, as counsel to entities in which Enron owns an 
equity interest and as outside counsel on isolated bankruptcy matters with 
Enron's in-house legal staff.? Aronzon said that if anyone has further 
questions regarding Milbank Tweed's relationship with Enron they can contact 
him directly (213-892-4377) or Lisa Mellencamp, Enron's general counsel (I 
believe that she can be reached at 713-853-3820).? Milbank Tweed will also be 
filing an application with the court, in connection with its representation 
of the unsecured creditors committee, which will list all potential 
conflicts.? This should be available on the court's web page - -? 
http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/canb/Documents.nsf? 

in the next few days.?

Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to make

get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a 
broader issue, do you have any report outlining outstanding bankruptcy

Please advise.

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following 
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was 
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the 
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky

Richard-

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

John

Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Peter

We are going around and around with Sitler's attorney about the appointment 
of arbitrators. The "contract", and I use that term loosely, between Sitler 
and Cgas calls for the appointment of 3 disinterested arbitrators. Sitler has 
appointed a friend of his who we do not believe qualifies as disinterested. 
The only claim Sitler should have is a request that the district court settle 
the dispute and order Cgas to appoint an arbitrator. 
I have asked Bruce Oakley at Bracewell to call Sitler's atty and fish for

It should. I am not sure what game they are playing. Maybe it allows them to 
argue their block forward positions should not be liquidated because PG&E is 
not in default to the PX.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Letter from PG&E Regarding Payment for November, 2 
000 Invoice


  ISO Market Participants:
  On January 31, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received
by fax a letter from Joseph C. Henri, Director of Utility Electric Portfolio
Management at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E). Mr. Henri stated that
PG&E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO
Tariff that "Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&E from performing all of its
obligations under the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Henri's letter identified
"government regulations and market conditions" as "forces beyond PG&E's
reasonable control."  In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporary
electric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission
on January 4, 2001 was "an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&E to
generate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills."
  Mr. Henri continued by stating that "PG&E...lacks the funds
to pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for November
power purchases, due on February 1, 2001."   Further, Mr. Henri stated that
"because PG&E's inability to make full payment is due to Uncontrollable
Forces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operator
from imposing any sanctions against PG&E."
  Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&E's efforts to secure
relief from these circumstances continue and that PG&E will inform the ISO
as soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale power
purchases.
  At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejects
the claims made in Mr. Henri's letter. The purpose of this market notice is
to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
PG&E based on PG&E's failure to pay in full ISO invoices.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for "Year 1" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for "Year 35" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly "running in the other direction" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied "mid-stream" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged "contract year" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month "Year 35" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a "global" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the "excess" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS "self bills" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
"overpayments" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the "excess" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?


Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of "Contract Capacity Factor" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage "haircut" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years "and thereafter from year to year," unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective "at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter." (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain "stub" years and certain "long" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying "calendar year" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
"contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a 
number of questions which are relevant:

Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%?
Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment?  What is his authority as a 
signatory?  If he's not an officer of this "Ecogas S.A." then why is his 
signature evidenced?

We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below.  Once received, 
I'll forward them if they're pertinent.

Randy,

I am concerned about our conversation of yesterday morning.  I sent by fax
to you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American details
which have Ecogas involvement.  As stated over the phone and set out in the
documents, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.  The
documents which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest as
it does not and never has existed.  I simply would not act in that manner
and would have expected you to hold that understanding.

Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that we
all direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather than
continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.

Regards,

Jerrel

Subject: Cuiaba Call--legal issues

1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) 
reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's 
letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to 
sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There 
are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows 
whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it 
is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask 
our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  
Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, 
Electronorte. 

2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the 
ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, 
Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political 
avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, 
however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek 
assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political 
battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to 
seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to 
progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has 
expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong 
message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we 
proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 
of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at 
the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little 
time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate 
proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what 
reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure 
how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the 
commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure 
what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may 
affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look 
at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or 
express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would 
advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with 
respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand 
every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix 
developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own 
way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have 
traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who 
represents them. 

3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE 
does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the 
contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm 
told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that 
we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine 
Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our 
force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our 
position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both 
parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  
I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.

4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration 
concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what 
it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. 
Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to 
consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of 
proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a 
number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It 
needs to be subject to review as we go along.

5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going 
to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and 
get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best 
advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the 
Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so 
I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in 
the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position 
that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.
Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. 
John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I 
may be unaware of with any strategic plan.
Regards,
Michelle

a timely fashion. Thereafter, Rob and I will coordinate the defense with 
local counsel and report in the usual fashion.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced 
case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The 
Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had 
previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined 
that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT 
owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be 
handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the 
activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this 
matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.

The main problem in getting him paid was that Blakes didn't send me his bill 
until Nov. We have processed the bill and he should have already received his 
money. I will call Larry today to apologize.

Larry Ruff sent along a note indicating that his invoice  (US$20,000)  for 
consulting services re Stanley has not been paid, 5 months after it was first 
submitted to Blakes.  He was told by Web MacDonald of Blakes that it had been 
submitted to Enron Corp in Houston for payment.  Hopefully we can expedite 
payment.  Evidently Larry has been approached by Enron's California counsel 
to do some work out there for Enron and Larry insisted on a retainer given 
his experience on Stanley.   Regards, Aleck

As we discussed this morning, I'm attaching the Purefood.org website for your
perusal.  They really don't seem to be PETA activists at all or "junk"
scientists.  I'm sure that you'll see they are simply looking for wholesome
food without dangerous additives, pesticides, etc.

Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Subject: Vibration Complaints at Gleason

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Peter

I left Twanda several messages last week about trying to schedule a conference
call to start the settlement discussions in the PCA case.  I know that last
message was to her direct voice mail, but the earlier ones may have been to a
wrong number (number dialed:  713-853-9042).  Sorry if they didn't get through
to her.

Nonetheless, the Trustee and counsel are available for a conference call on
Thursday, Oct. 26th in the morning after 10:30 CST and up until 2:00 pm.  Do 
you
have any time on Thursday.  I know it is late notice, but if you do, then I'd
say let's get the ball rolling.

I am available on Wednesday to sit down and review the issues, numbers, etc. 
in
preparation of such a call.  If we go forward on Thursday, let me know what
works for you on Wednesday.  Thanks.

I'm in the office Monday morning, but will be traveling on Monday afternoon 
and
am out on Tuesday in a deposition.  Thanks.

I spoke with Jim Studdert re this matter, and he advised that he believes 
that it may be covered at least in part by our insurance program.  He is 
forwarding it to our insurers for their review.  (I understand that he's 
never gotten a definitive answer re coverage in the other NSM matters, so 
that may end up being the case here.)  I will let you know when I hear 
anything further re a coverage determination.

I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke 
yesterday. As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences 
between the parties. The legal issue is one straight out of first year 
Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding 
contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response 
to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded 
simply "I agree." But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the 
email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I 
am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In 
other words I think we can make a good argument to get around  the damaging " 
I agree" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still 
doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement 
provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must 
have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that 
kind of panel. I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range. 
Let me know if you need anything further.

Subject: Duke meeting

Julian Poole and I attended at meeting at our office with Erik Ludtke and Amy 
Statler of Duke Intl. today.  We reviewed the tapes and the emails, and they 
are hanging their hat on the fact that the only monomic price published by 
Cammesa is the index to which they are referring.   Our answer to that claim 
is that they defined the trade as a 7 by 24 flat load, when the index they 
are trying to use is a demand weighted index.  Also, in the tape, immediately 
following the word "monomic" by Amy, is a definitional description; "capacity 
plus energy".   Cammesa states that there is no where that you can find the 
definition of the word monomic in their library.  We believe that monomic 
means the hourly price plus the capacity payment for peak hours.

Lastly, the index she wants to use is a monthly number, published only once a 
month, but she states in her  "let's add" email that she would like it to "be 
the monthly average of the monomic spot price published by Cammesa"  I asked 
her how do you calculate the monthly average of a number that is published 
once a month.  I related to her that the logic did not follow.  She responded 
with a forgettable comment.

We had a long discussion about whether or not a trade had occurred.  I 
explained to them that legally, the transaction is not closed until the deal 
is closed by an authorized ECT trader in Houston. Also, we explained the 
closure process to them multiple times.   We never admitted to a trade.

They think that they caught Julian.  I told them that if they had been 
clearer in their definition of their desired index, I would feel a "trader's 
obligation" to follow-thru with the process, but if they wanted to use the 
"Precio Medio Monomico as Published by the Cammesa in the section of The 
Boletin entitled Los Resultados Economicos for the applicable months"   or  
the "Precio Medio En El Mes, Monomico, published in the Informe Mensual under 
the heading Precio de la Energia and Monomico", they should have just said it.

They want $500,000 in LD's, or they will let us honor the trade and flip it 
out to them at $22.50 for a MTM loss of $308,000.  Our estimate is that the 
alleged trade is about $220,000 out of the money at present.

Our decision is to allow this matter to take its course.  Erik is going to 
decide what he wants to do, and will inform me.  If he wants to pursue the 
matter, he will refer the matter to Bruce of Duke Intl.

If anyone has any instructions as to how we should proceed, please let us 
know.

For future reference, the traders here have been informed to not agree to 
things in an email, even if they are agreeing to the clarification of an 
outline of a deal clearly marked "INDICATION".  Lesson learned.

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EESI"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").  We
make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with
the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering
to produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived any
objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,
defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have
been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.
For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from
disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.


GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data
will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase
and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipate
producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and
the transaction data in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents
available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling
coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do
not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit
requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.
 For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documents
and we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General will
provide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the data
being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respect
to specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest that
these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a
representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that
the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the
arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these
documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Request 13, 15, 16, 17, 19

 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for
year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,
delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Because
of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some
entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI
served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will
show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding
transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is that
this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an
accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI can
also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not
include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide
a blind customer number.  Many of ESSI's customers have agreements whereby
they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.
ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its
customers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transaction
data in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Subject: 



I have just learned of another lawsuit involving CGAS.  This had been
handled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is why
neither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.

This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.  The style is
Kilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.  In the Court of
Common Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio  Case No. CH96-0311.

CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.  Eastland Energy had a lease on an
adjoining tract.  Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill a
well on a unit formed by the two leases.  CGAS agreed.  Eastland was
designated operator.  Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.
Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.  Eastland thought Kilbarger
negligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half the
drilling cost.  Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit against
Eastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)
and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.  Kilbarger was not
seeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless since
CGAS has since released its lease.  Thus, we have no pending claims from
Kilbarger.

However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.  During
the drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work for
Eastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.  Those
contractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGAS
paid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.  Eastland did not
pay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for
$7,139.69.  No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.

I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.
There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case is
set for trial on December 16.  I am hopeful this will be resolved before
trial.  If there are questions, please call.

any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any
claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses

The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain. I guess 
Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six 
months. There is really nothing more to it than that. When we1) all get a 
little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have 
our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it 
alot more. No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save 
Yvonne.                                                                       
                              

I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid 
w/ you. July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training 
school in Austin. We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado  or 
Calif. How about Canada or Alaska.

		 Subject: Project "Bighorn" (Colstrip Energy Limited Partnership)

Hi John.  I wanted to get you (and Richard Sanders) thinking about a request 
we have received from Owen Orndorff (who, for Richard's benefit, is one of 
the principals in Rosebud Energy Corp., the general partner of Colstrip 
Energy Limited Partnership ("CELP"), in which Enron, now through the "Condor" 
vehicle, holds a 25% limited partner interest;  CELP owns a waste 
coal-burning QF in Montana).

Rosebud has expressed an interest in filing suit against Montana Power 
Company ("MPC"), the facility's offtake purchaser, for MPC's refusal to allow 
CELP to remarket power above the minimum contract demand under the facility's 
PPA.  I will fax to you and to Richard a memorandum that the Doney, Crowley 
firm, which traditionally has done some work for CELP, has prepared regarding 
litigation theories and chances of success.  Owen has preliminarily scheduled 
a partnership meeting to discuss this issue (among others, as yet identified) 
on April 25th in Chicago.

My preliminary reactions to the Doney memo are that, at the time it was 
written, at least, there were a number of issues that had not been fully 
enough  researched for the partners to be making a decision.  I will ask 
Terry Donovan if further work has been done by now.  My initial reactions are 
that (1) having the PPA be the subject of a pending lawsuit could make our 
current efforts to sell our interest much more difficult;  (2) the potential 
is there for MPC to cook up some kind of counterclaim, which, even if not 
successful, puts additional pressure on the PPA, could draw out the 
litigation, and add costs, not to mention problems for our sale, and (3) the 
effort could result in as yet unknown costs to the partners (since, as I 
recall uner the partnership agreement, the costs would be borne by the 
partners - ??).  I also need to check and see just who within Enron is 
supposed to call the shots on the strategy for this, given that the 
investment is now held in Condor.

I will be out of the country on vacation beginning late Friday, April 6th, 
until Monday, April 23.  I'd like to touch base with you before I leave, 
since there won't be much time to develop our response to Owen prior to the 
meeting on the 25th.  At that time, we can also talk about what might come up 
on the sale effort while I'm out (at this point, there shouldn't be much, as 
Terry seems immersed on another deal).

I'll be in SF all this week trying to close on Pastoria, but am reachable at 
the office there (415/782-7800) or by pager (800/316-0430).  Thanks.

Sheila and Karen,

As you requested, our accounting department has not been following up on our
outstanding invoices -- which at this point total about $700,000 (see
attached).  Sheila, I gather you told Barry you would try to get us current
before the end of November.  That would be great if you can do it.  (I can
give you wire info if you need it.)  If we don't make November (I know
you're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us that
we get caught up by year end.  Let me or Barry know if there's anything we
need to do.

Harlan

A couple of things:

(1)  I hope you are dry

(2)  Rebecca McDonald's prep session is supposed to be at 10 a.m. today.  In 
the event no postponement of her depo was agreed to, Robert Rivera is 
planning to be at McDonald's office at 10 a.m.  I don't know if Mark Lowes 
will be there or not.  I told McDonald's assistant that it was up to her 
whether to have Mark there or not.  By the way, please let me know by e-mail 
what is up with the settlement talks.

(3)  Do you still need Red Sox tickets?  If so, let me know.  Cliff and I 
worked quite a bit with a firm up in Boston (Hill & Barlow) and I am sure I 
could have them find tickets for you.

Later.

Good to see you at lunch.  Coincidentally, I got back to my office and had
several emails from some of our lawyers up in Dallas, saying we had been
approached by Duke about representing them in a large gas litigation matter
brought against them by Enron.  I, of course, told them "HELL NO."  But let
us know if Susman screws it up, and you need us to bail you out.

When Bill gets back to his office (around 3:30 ECT) we will give you a call
to discuss.  If possible, it would also be helpful to get an update on
progress made on understanding the claim filed by Infineum and possible
meeting times later next week to discuss the case with LeBouf, Lamb.

Richard: 

Please see the attached draft letter to Mike Swartz.? Give us your thoughts. 

Some background:? When Roland told Mike Swartz that we were not going to turn 
cartwheels to produce Enron witnesses to, effectively, Farallon's counsel, he 
got quite huffy.? Shortly after that, I received a call from Oaktree's 
General Counsel reminding me of Enron's responsibilities under the Release.? 
You may get a call also, from either Ken Liang or Brian Berman.

In the meantime, as you will see from the attached draft, we have discovered 
that the Release it clearly provides that Oaktree will not disclose anything 
it learns from Enron to it co-plaintiff Farallon.? Given that, how can 
Hennegan interview Brian--is he promising not to tell his client Farallon 
what he learns on behalf of his client Oaktree?? I think we are on good 
grounds, but we definitely should talk about this.

Steve?

in La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that  included litigation.
He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judge
in 1998.  None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have a
relationship with him from their days in practice.  Also, he may not keep
the case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to the
case filed against the generators, which has a lower number.  People who
know Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright.

He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is now
retired.  Another has also retired.  The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, who
is of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.

Thanks
Gary

I am not sure about the purpose of this letter. The better response in my 
mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door. If we do send 
them a letter, and I leave that to you, we need to have already filed the 
petition. Then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter.

I don't know what the deal with Doug is. Maybe we are a lot more aggressive 
than you when it comes to inviting ourselves on his vacation. I  knew he was 
going to be there. Late last week, Julie and I decided to go to Austin 
instead of her coming to Houston for the weekend. I called Doug and told him 
we were coming. My approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance 
to to so. He didn't say no.

I should have called you earlier. Julie must have told me to call you 5 times 
on Sat. The truth is I am so freaking tired that I just didn't do it until 
Sun. We did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time. Love 
Richard

I gave this to Gail to handle. She in turn is getting Bob Vote to handle. In 
the documents I received yesterday, I only saw an application for writ of 
garnishment, not a signed order--do you have one?

		 Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

Thanks for getting back to me.  Twanda also left a message this morning.

I am available at 3:00 on Wednesday, so consider that booked.  I'll come over 
to
your offices.  I have called the Trustee's counsel to propose times on 
Thursday
morning.  Hopefully we can start around 10:30 am, and I would be surprised if
this first conversation went more than an hour to an hour and one-half.  Of
course, I am planning on coming to your offices for the call on Thursday, but 
if
a lunch in the "restuarant rich" area of downtown holds any appeal, please
consider coming down here and we'll go to lunch afterwards.

I think it may be helpful if Elizabeth Sager is available on Wednesday to go
over the how Enron calculated the Termination Payment (I know the payment was
zero, but the amount of "Gains" to Enron under the Master Agreement may have
some bearing in connection with their unjust enrichment claims) and her
calculation of Enron's gain from selling the power otherwise deliverable to 
PCA
in the market after the Master Agreement was terminated.  Elizabeth has
recalculated the proper amount of EPMI's proof of claim, and it appears that 
the
original proof of claim was overstated a bit.

You may have all this information -- but if not, Elizabeth does and we should
get our arms around it.

I'm going to be messengering to you today the Trust's mediation statement 
filed
in connection with the other defendants.  I only have a fax, and if I fax it 
to
you, you won't be able to read it.  It would be beneficial for you to review
this statement as it sets forth the Trustee's position in more detail.    It
provides the basis for their claim of unjust enrichment, even though I 
continue
to believe that unjust enrichment is not available in connection with the 
Master
Agreement and EPMI's termination for unpaid invoices.

I also think it would be helpful to connect Liz Austin into our conversation 
on
Wednesday so that she can advise you of her experience in mediating with the
Trustee.  She has represented at least one other defendant who mediated with 
the
Trust successfully.  Her insights of what to expect will be helpful.

Thanks.

		 Subject: Edison's Filing in District Court in L.A.

Michael Tribolet:

In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
through the power purchase costs to customers.)

The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
us to make a copy for ourselves.

Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
that filing passed around to this distribution list.

Best,
Jeff

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,
Frank

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

The requirement that all three arbitrators have 10 years of experience in 
unrealistic. We will be hard pressed to find one. Most arbitrators are 
lawyers.
With respect to the second change, it is not a change we should make. This  
changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the 
arbitrators is our advocate, to a totally nuetral panel.

Your revisions look good. For the last paragraph,change this to "...Enron has 
not asked Enerstar to reimburse Enron's considerable expenses"
