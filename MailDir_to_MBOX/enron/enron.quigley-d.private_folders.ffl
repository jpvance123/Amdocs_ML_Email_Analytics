Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to st=

AGE]Jeff Graham, WR SD  Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday =
at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach =
Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in=
 his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Charg=
ers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complicati=

Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throw=
ing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.=
  [IMAGE]Jeff Garcia, QB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time w=
as limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that=
 he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't great=
ly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining=
 weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   [IMAGE]Eddie George=
, RB TEN  Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite sufferi=

 Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams m=
uch during Weeks 15 through 17.    [IMAGE]Chris Weinke, QB CAR  Updated 12/=
21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the=

01 McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of ba=

asy glory.   Corey Dillon , Active RB Updated 12/21/01 Dillon missed practi=

If you want to purchase Lion King tickets, our  company is offering a presale for them.  The prices are 131, 76,66,56,26  depending on the location.  131 is within the first 14 rows and 76 are  located anywhere in rows 15-25.  I need to have payments by next Wed. for  the tickets.  I am limited on the amount of tix I can get, although I can  probably get at least 4 per person.  Let me know if you want any...and get  me some cash.
 
Later,
 
Kevin

- South Park Cows Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early =
in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the fir=
st quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T=
-Bone Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He i=
s not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Beer Gut =
Boys Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with l=
abored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN =
- High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's ga=
me, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Sp=
ergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls  , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/23/01 Wall=
s was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left th=
e game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , =
K TB - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring=
 in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gra=
matica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - High S=
hrivel Factor Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday'=
s game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play wit=
h some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 12/23/=
01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of=
 his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham does=
n't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be sig=
ned off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 re=
ceiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Sm=
ith  , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 ya=
rds and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AF=
C and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN=
 - Money Shots Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering fr=
om back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the s=
econd half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - CYSWC=
 Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played =
in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He pl=
ayed with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia=
 might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be =
a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated=
 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle =
injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned =
to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/23/01=
 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a =
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB=
 SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will pro=
bably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO -=
 Addison Red Cornholes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like =
an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks=
 of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/21/01 A ban=
ged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend o=
n him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1=
 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and=
 won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke =
, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during t=
he Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbe=
rs, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB=
 STL - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams =
to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of th=
e way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/21/01 Gannon h=
as been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many =
title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Repla=
cements Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once aga=
in been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your p=
layoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 12/21/01 Minnis ha=
sn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the r=
emaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut B=
oys Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fanta=
sy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardn=
er  , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsiste=
nt this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't =
advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - South Park Cows Updated 12/21/01 Ri=
chardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him d=
uring the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Aryan Brother Inc. Up=
dated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still,=
 he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , Q=
B GB - Water Boys Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this =
season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green =
, QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent F=
antasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   B=
ill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had=
 a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your po=

n place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't hel=
p Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR -=
 KMB Express Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantas=
y playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but h=
e is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Th=
e Hillrods Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to succe=
ss during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  =
Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been=
 a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title t=
eams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one o=
f the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  =
Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much=
 to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks=
 of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman U=
pdated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy pl=
ayer. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , =
WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent thi=
s season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisa=
ble.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson ha=
sn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the F=
antasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Xtreme Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez=
 hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to =
bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to=
 help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Free Agent Up=
dated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a=
 risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby=
 Blues Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to b=
e a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SE=
A - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment th=
is year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , WR=

 but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him i=

ing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NY=
G - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit of a down =

MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore thr=
owing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, an=
d is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's m=
atchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Up=
dated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family i=
llness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, b=
ut he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/=
29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. =
However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. =
  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is exp=
ected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start a=
t this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - K=
MB Express Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, an=
d may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his plac=
e again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Sprin=
gs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday aga=
inst San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time w=
ill likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 12/29/01 Bo=
uman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Sperg=
on Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in =
place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's l=
oss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the F=
antasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Accordi=
ng to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bled=
soe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it s=
eems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would cer=
tainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made u=
ntil sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Leather Cheeri=
os Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's g=
ame, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insur=
ance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. =
  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's sta=
tus is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but =
Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.=
   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated 12/28/01 Wes=
tbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play th=
is week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins ma=
y miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold J=
ackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran  , WR=
 ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a kn=
ee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free =
Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot =
over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time=
 now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end se=
ts in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 12/28/01 G=
adsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamst=
ring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said =
Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still ex=
pected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will=
 be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Pierres Flea Ci=
rcus Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is=
 still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated =
12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He =
is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated =
12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago =
will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Br=
ookins  , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned=
 to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game a=
ction until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 1=
2/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is=
 expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal=
 workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Pumpdog Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle=
) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wes=
ley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on T=
hursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maur=
ice Smith , RB ATL - Xtreme Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  w=
ill continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney =
Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. =
He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Up=
dated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=
rt this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took=
 a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full =
strength" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely=
 to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's =
practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, whe=
n players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of=
 the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more =
snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later i=
n the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS U=
pdated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practi=
ce field Thursday for the first time in a month. "Still questionable," coac=
h Bill Cowher said. "He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and=
 go from there. We'll take it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent=
 Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the =
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatic=
a can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-=
21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out=
 for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to ha=

in Gramatica , K TB - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injur=
ed his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT =
attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman ,=
 QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sun=
day's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play=
 with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 1=
2/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the dea=
th of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham=
 doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will b=
e signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No.=
 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowa=
in Smith  , RB NE - She Said Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-hig=
h 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners i=
n the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair =
, QB TEN - She Said Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite sufferi=
ng from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in =
the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - =
The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limit=
ed all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has =
a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affec=
t his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks b=
ut he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - The=
 Wounded Ducks Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite su=
ffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a nec=
k injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden  , WR MIA - She Said Upd=
ated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots =
because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred=
 Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand=
. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe H=
orn , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again perf=
orming like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the=
 final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Xtreme Updated 1=
2/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. D=
on't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - F=
ree Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week=
 as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive,=
 however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    =
Chris Weinke , QB CAR - KMB Express Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a b=
ackup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than=
-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Ku=
rt Warner , QB STL - The Hillrods Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many=
 Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him=
 the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 1=
2/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key=
 player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR=
 MIN - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but ha=
s once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him dur=
ing your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 =
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him dur=
ing the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - T=
hird World Countryman Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this=
 season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your pl=
ayoffs.  Rod Gardner  , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has be=
en very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, start=
ing Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Update=
d 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Do=
n't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Xtreme U=
pdated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still=
, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , =
QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this=
 season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green=

2/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwin=
g elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is=
 expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's match=
up vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Upd=
ated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family il=
lness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, bu=
t he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/2=
9/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. H=
owever, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.  =
 Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expe=
cted to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at=
 this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and =
may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place =
again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs,=
 who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday agains=
t San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will=
 likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12=
/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb inju=
ry. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pa=
ckers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last=
 week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep i=
nto the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/0=
1 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acqui=
ring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterb=
ack, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move =
would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely =
be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - High Shri=
vel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Satu=
rday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien =
as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy s=
tarter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status=
 is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mil=
e Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   =
Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's sta=
tus is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   M=
arTay Jenkins , WR ARI - High Shrivel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may m=
iss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jack=
son would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran  , WR AT=
L - Water Boys Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee =
injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot ove=
r rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time no=
w that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets =
in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 12/=
28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But hi=
s hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Mo=
ney Shots Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He i=
s still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter becau=
se he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - The R=
eplacements Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week=
. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Addison Red Cornholes =
Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thurs=
day. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent =
Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. S=
antiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   =
Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned=
 to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game a=
ction until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/28/=
01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expe=
cted to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal work=
load.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Barking Spiders Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (an=
kle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   =
Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practi=
ce on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.=
   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - CYSWC Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/kn=
ee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated R=
odney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , =
RB ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a=
 calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - =
Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to pr=
actice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - High Sh=
rivel Factor Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't a=
ppear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting ag=
ainst Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches d=
idn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participat=
e in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fu=
lly suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporte=
rs were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said =
Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. =
   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, =
sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for th=
e first time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He =
did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll ta=
ke it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien =
signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wh=
o will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. =
Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Sain=
ts last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's ga=
me against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case=
 the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  [IMA=

3/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able =

  Jeff Graham , WR SD  Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday a=
t Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach M=
ike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in =
his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The ! Ch! =
argers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complic=

h rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been =
one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy=
 glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday =
despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a tou=

rcia , QB SF  Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all =
week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a crack=
ed rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his t=
hrows. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he w=
ill still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated 12/=
23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle inju=
ry. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to t=
he game.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA  Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play i=
n Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris=
 Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF  Updated 12/23/01 B=
easley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of =
the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO  Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again=
 performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player durin=
g the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL  Updated 12/2=
1/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don'=
t depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 w=
ideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and w=
on't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , =
QB CAR  Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy pla=
yoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is =
a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL  Updated =
12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playo=
ffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OA=
K  Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He w=
ill be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Ran=
dy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but ha=
s once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him dur=
ing your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn'=
t done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the rema=
ining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 12/21/=
01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will=
 be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS  Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play=
 in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson ,=
 RB KC  Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat=
 this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE=
 KC  Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year.=
 Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Fa=
vre , QB GB  Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this seaso=
n. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB =
KC  Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. H=
e is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB =
 Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a re=
liable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Upd=
ated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use=
 him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , WR DET  Updated 12/2=
1/01 Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid =
No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.  Reggie Wayne ,=
 WR IND  Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of impr=
ovement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fant=
asy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG  Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit=
 of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him =
worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.=
  Marvin Harrison , WR IND  Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important =
Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some =
good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce Sta=
ley , RB PHI  Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the seas=
on. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate b=
ack for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF  Updated 12/21/01 Bryson wil=
l start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a N=
o. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=

I am sure that many of you will get them  all right on the first try. On my first try, I got eight (8) of them correct.  That number will surely be beat by either John or Ricky.

  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, wh=
o has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He did=
n't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zero=
n Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league,=
 dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel F=
actor Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played i=
n Monday night's 24-17 l! os! s to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 y=
ards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Barl=
ow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "I=
t's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't really slee=
p last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as=
 doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on res=
erve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffere=
d a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle.=
 X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a=
 precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he wi=
ll be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff=
 Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hypere=
xtended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Mond=
ay, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight =
end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR! G! B -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straig=
ht weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status =
for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy te=
am in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis=
, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out=
 what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his healt=
h, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut h=
im altogehter.   Jam! es! Stewart  , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/27=
/01 Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Gr=
een Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time p=
osting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the la=
ck of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Ch=
arlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit=
 Free Press, Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despi=
te a groin injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said=
. "He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the inj=
ury) treated...I would expect him close to full spe! ed! Wednesday." He'll =
likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is =
a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01=
 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. T=
he veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - T=
eam T-Bone Updated 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status =
for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if =
Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until lat=
er in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover=
 (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panther=
s are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans=
.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsi=
stent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke'! s ! job as Carolina's No. 1 quart=
erback is secure. "There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very s=
uccessful that have gone through times like this," coach George Seifert tol=
d the Charlotte Observer. "Even though there are a number of these plays th=
at haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think,=
 ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not." While he may be the star=
ting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fant=
asy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/27=
/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstr=
ing injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. Ho=
wever, he is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. "I'll be ther=
e," Sanders told the Arizona Republic. "They're just real sore from doing a=
 lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear." In any event, keeping =
Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondar=
y.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was=
 supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing noth=
ing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progress," coach Dave McGinnis to=
ld the Arizona Republic. "We're going to come to a point where we're going =
to ha! ve! to make a decision." Moore, who has missed the entire season due=
 to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.   Olandi=
s Gary , RB DEN - Team T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gary on i=
njured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This =
officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Dro=
p him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Upd=
ated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the secon=
d half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did n=
ot throw a touchdown pass for the first time this season, however, and has =
been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues =
to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week =
12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who=
 will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batc=
h is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. M=
ike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, =
but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears seco=
ndary. We don't recommend an! y ! of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter =
, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Ca=
rter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's=
 game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for D=
allas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don'=
t recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Team =
T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota =
with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit.=
 Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a fi=
nal decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Update=
d 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hams=
tring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game aga=
inst San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on =
him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Graham =
suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is=
 day to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/26/0=
1 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore wi=
ll elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Aya=
nbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Ba=
rlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not =
been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 11/26/01=
 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is da=
y to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/26/01 Warrick=
 is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was=
 taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinna=
ti's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , ! QB! CIN - Addison Red Cornh=
oles Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals desp=
ite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ine=
ffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the ga=
me. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. =
 Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and =
two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his=
 good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Q=
adry Ismail , WR BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Is=
mail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performan=
ce, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of t=
he most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  More Updates  [IMAGE=

s  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA  Updated 12/29/01 Fi=
edler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. H=
e is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected =
to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the=
 Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 12/29/01 McNair wa=
s excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as =
questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to star=
t.   Larry Foster , WR DET  Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to =
play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to star=
t at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET  Updated 12/=
29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However=
, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play=
 this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely sta=
rt in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA  Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Spri=
ngs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday ag=
ainst San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time =
will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN  Updated 12/29/01 Bouman wil=
l miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn =
will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN  Updated 12/29/01 Wynn wil=
l start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured=
 Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville,=
 is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Dre=
w Bledsoe , QB NE  Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chi=
cago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly en=
trenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become exp=
endable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passin=
g game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   M=
artin Gramatica , K TB  Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled=
 out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicke=
r Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very ri=
sky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB  Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status=
 is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mil=
e Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   =
Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to d=
ay with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins ,=
 WR ARI  Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with=
 an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's t=
hird receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL  Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is liste=
d as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyron=
e Davis , TE GB  Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tigh=
t end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of p=
laying time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double t=
ight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA  Updated 12/28/01 =
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hams=
tring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 1=
2/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to=
 play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less =
than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC  Updated 12/28/01 Smith (f=
lu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe=
 Horn , WR NO  Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in pr=
actice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CL=
E  Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J=
. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.=
   Jason Brookins , RB BAL  Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to pract=
ice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action unt=
il Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss=
 this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third d=
owns this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR=
 PHI  Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he =
is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 12/28/01 Wa=
lls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime de=
cision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL  Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Sm=
ith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has i=
ndicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Ch=
ristian , RB ATL  Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf inju=
ry. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 12/=
28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this w=
eek.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN  Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thurs=
day but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria=
 for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, =
though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman d=
idn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on =
plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular pract=
ice t! ha! t reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bou=
man. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed p=
ortion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT  Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sid=
elined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the f=
irst time in a month. "Still questionable," coach Bill Cowher said. "He did=
 more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take =
it day to day."   Doug Brien , K TB  Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-ye=
ar contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him =
against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strai=
ned his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory o! ve! r the Saints last wee=
k. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against =
Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bo=

Bitching is what I do, so I will continue to bitch.  Please look us up some
sports bar near Texarkana so I can watch some NFL action after I kick your
butts at golf.  Long live the Beaver!!!  Mark, your driving right...I think
we need to leave at 4 am or so to make it to the border.

Smooches.

2/19/01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more=

groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come =
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's =
playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His healt=

Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work ov=

 game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to rep=
air a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday=

 Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zereoue re-i=
njured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His s=
tatus for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a ma=
rginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Free Agen=

rving as his backup.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 12/18/0=
1 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder=
 of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter=
 during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel Whit=
e, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the=
 way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - CYSWC Updated 12/18/01 Dil=
lon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. =
He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve=
 him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Rave=
ns' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/1=
8/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna=
's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mit=
chell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth startin=
g in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.  Akili Smith  , QB CIN=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve =
with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will like=
ly need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. =
Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's h=
ealthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the y=
ear anyway.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 12/18/01 The R=
avens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati afte=
r Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries f=
or 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he r=
ecovered from a ! ha! nd injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a=
 Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Wa=
ter Boys Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that h=
e plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew B=
rees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in =
the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during th=
e Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in =
favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Lake Austin Mighty Mul=
lets Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possi=
bly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable f=
or Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his st=
atus before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free=

 this week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determi=
ne his true status for the game.   More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE=

benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Jeff Garcia , Activ=
e QB Updated 12/17/01 Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he =
shouldn't miss his next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed =
no broken bones. Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some p=
ractice before Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the qua=
rterback to play.   Chad Lewis , Active TE Updated 12/17/01 Lewis injured h=
is groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Derrick Alexander , =
Reserve WR Updated 12/16/01 Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a t=
ouchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alex=
ander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues.   Antonio Fr=
eeman , Active WR Updated 12/16/01 The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards o=
n two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can =
expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead.   Desmond Clark , Re=
serve TE Updated 12/14/01 Clark will continue to be a featured target for t=
he Broncos during the Fantasy postseason. Denver is still coping with injur=
y issues at wide receiver.  Maurice Smith , Reserve RB Updated 12/14/01 The=
 Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Smith's ailing knee has continued to imp=
rove, but Bob Christian may get the bulk of the team's carries on Sunday.  =
Larry Parker , Reserve WR Updated 12/10/01 Parker suffered a bruised right =
shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day=
.  Antowain Smith , Active RB Updated 12/09/01 Smith rushed for 76 yards an=
d two TDs on 21 carries against Cleveland. He has always been a great red-z=
one runner, so expect a lot of scores from Smith during the Fantasy playoff=
s even if his yardage totals disappoint you at times.  Darnay Scott , Activ=
e WR Updated 12/02/01 Scott caught four passes for 30 yards against Tampa B=
ay. Like all of the Cincinnati wideouts, he is not worth a Fantasy roster s=
pot right now.  Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a ne=
ck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   J.R. Redmon=
d , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injur=
y on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing ti=
me to help Fantasy leaguers.  Raiders , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raid=
ers have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore h=
is Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery th=
is week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In ot=
her news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dal=
las Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is qu=
estionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   =
Bills , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's=
 game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury=
. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his =
return is questionable.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinat=
ieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent week=
s, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his c=
hances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggl=
es like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite k=
ickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]=

ltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his th=
rowing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect eithe=
r QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season=
.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Sm=
ith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending h=
is season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his =
hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest =
of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinn! at! i qu=
arterback the rest of the year anyway.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - She Said Up=
dated 12/18/01 The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday aga=
inst Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined f=
or just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of =
the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a wor=
thy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.  Doug Flut=
ie , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley sai=
d Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead o=
f rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some p=
laying time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky p=
layer during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility h=
e could sit in favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Pumpdog=
 Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly =
Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for S=
unday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status=
 before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup thi=
s week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine h=
is true status for the game.   More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]KMB=
 Express Player News  Derrick Mason , Active WR Updated 12/19/01 Mason miss=
ed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day t=
o day.  Travis Henry , Reserve RB Updated 12/19/01 Henry will miss Sunday's=
 game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , Reserve WR Updated 12/18/01 Muhammad is dealing with a sli=
ght case of turf toe, which caused him to miss practice on Monday. However,=
 Coach George Seifert expects his veteran wideout to start this weekend aga=
inst St. Louis.   Corey Dillon , Active RB Updated 12/18/01 Dillon's disloc=
ated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed=
 as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based o=
n this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong r=
ush defense.  Peyton Manning , Active QB Updated 12/16/01 Manning got back =
on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an interception against the =
Colts. He remains a must-start player in all Fantasy leagues.  Ike Hilliard=
 , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard th=
is week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's second=
ary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.  Shannon Sharpe , Re=
serve TE Updated 12/13/01 Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is exp=
ected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is listed as probable on t=
he injury report.   Jeff Graham , Reserve WR Updated 12/09/01 Graham caught=
 five passes for 110 yards and two TDs at Philadelphia, but he did not catc=
h a ball in the second half. The veteran wideout has been inconsistent all =
year long, yet he is still capable of having some big games.   J.J. Stokes =
, Active WR Updated 12/09/01 Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Lou=
is. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly usel=
ess for most of the season.  Duce Staley , Active RB Updated 12/09/01 The C=
hargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught five p=
asses for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to utilize Stal=
ey as the NFL regular season winds down.  Jets , Reserve DT Updated 12/03/0=
1 CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collatera=
l ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more=
 often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing y=
ards in the next few games.  Chris Weinke , Reserve QB Updated 12/02/01 Wei=
nke had only 161 yards passing, but he did have two rushing touchdowns agai=
nst New Orleans. However, he's still not reliable as a Fantasy player.   Jo=
e Nedney , Active K Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunda=
y's game but is expected to play this week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserve RB Upd=
ated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and h=
ad one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy=
 leaguers.  Raiders , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE T=
race Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendo=
n in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be pla=
ced on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roder=
ick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after =
sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sun=
day after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   John Kasay , Reser=
ve K Updated 08/13/01 Kasay, who is returning from a knee injury, made his =
comeback on Friday night. He converted on a 20-yard field goal, and seemed =
to have all the strength back in his leg. In fact, Kasay attempted a 60-yar=
der at the end of the game which had plenty of distance but sailed wide lef=
t. Now that he seems to be healthy, Kasay is worth considering come Draft D=

he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/=

9/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury=
. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agen=
t Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pack=
ers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last w=

According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiri=

 Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over =
