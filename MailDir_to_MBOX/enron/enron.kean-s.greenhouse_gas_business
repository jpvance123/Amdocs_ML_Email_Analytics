Kelly:

Thanks for the quick turn-around.

The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India 
by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!!  Many people, including Rob B. have seen 
these positions.  Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a 
position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not 
argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting 
involved, as a company, in scientific arguments).

The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial 
ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what 
Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is 
a pure business decision.  This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the 
Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me.

Please see the attached.  As you know, Ken was in Davos.  Look at this 
summary that came directly off of the Davos web site -- climate change was 
seen by business leader at Davos as the greatest challenge during the next 
century.  Our middle-of-the-road position was the mainstream Davos CEO 
position!

Good show!  My initial thought, however is that we need to vet this position 
internally, namely with senior management, and get them to agree that this is 
our position.  As you will recall, Ken got very different views on the issue 
from different people as we prepared for Davos and we need to run it up the 
flagpole.  I think it is clearly a time for a more defined position, and it 
should help us with the environmental community.

What do you think?  Maybe I am off base and we are all in agreement, but when 
I hear from our friend Rob Bradley it does not seem that way!

On Tuesday, I met with Steve Kean to discuss a variety of greenhouse gas 
policy issues.  
Among these matters was my request to more formally  articulate Enron's 
greenhouse gas policies.

I get frequent calls for information on our climate change policy and have 
never sent out any paper on our views.

Attached are some questions and answers I have used, and many many other 
Enron staff have used to articulate our policies.  They were originally 
drafted to support a meeting Ken Lay had with the President 2 years ago and 
have been periodically updated.

I want to take these thoughts and simply put them into a brochure format.  
Simple, quick, cheap!

Steve Kean said to co-ordinate with the two of you.  That is what I am now 
doing.  Any thoughts?  Please get back to me soon.

CHEERS!

John P.

I met with a contact at the Department of State Global Affairs division today.  While much was up in the air given last week's events, here is some information on where things stand for now:

1) The U.N. and Morocco intend to hold the next set of climate change negotiations (COP-7) as planned in late October. Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky is scheduled to attend, but that could change.  

2)  If the negotiations go forward, the U.S. will not seek to delay action by the other nations, but will engage to protect U.S. interests (consistent with their approach in Bonn in July);

3) Jim Connaughton, head of the White House's Counsel on Environmental Quality, has taken the staff lead on developing the Bush Administration's alternative.  While Connaughton has expressed confidence that he can put a plan together (timeline uncertain -- but aiming for COP-7), some feel that is ambitious given the political divide on this issue within the Administration, and especially given the current focus on security and a response to the terrorist attacks last week.  With regard to COP-7 timing, I would agree on both counts.

I will work with Pat and Jeff on follow-up with CEQ to get up to speed on their current thinking and offer our expertise as appropriate.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

The climate news from Bonn this week is very  good.  Against the odds, and defying expectations, 178 nations have agreed  to proceed with implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.  The United States  alone refused to participate in this remarkable achievement.  
 
Two weeks ago every environmentalist I know was  gloomy about the prospects for agreement.  Japan, Canada, and Australia had  expressed grave misgivings about going forward without the U.S.  There were  rumblings of doubt from several European nations.  But in Bonn the  imperative of taking a first step to protect the global climate proved strong  enough to persuade negotiators to step back from entrenched positions.   Europe agreed to flexibility in the treatment of "sinks" (forests and  agricultural soils that absorb CO2), and "trading" (the ability of a nation that  falls short of its target to purchase credits from a nation that exceeds its  target).  Japan, Australia, and Canada agreed to join.  With strong  leadership from conference chair Jan Pronk the result is a legally binding  international agreement that achieves a little less than hoped 4 years ago, but  much more than nothing.  If it is all it appears to be it is a profoundly  important commitment to take a first step.
 
There are two great ironies about the impact of  the U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.
 
The first is that the U.S. criticism of the  Protocol, and failure to offer any alternative whatsoever, helped the rest of  the world to reach agreement.  A very senior Japanese official whom I spoke  with expressed frustration and confusion that Japan's urgent efforts to stand by  the U.S. and open the negotiations to alternatives - despite strong popular  support for the Kyoto agreement in Japan - were met with stony silence.   "What do they want," this official asked, "Do they know?" U.S. silence  foreclosed negotiations and pushed Japan and others toward Europe.
 
My colleague Tony LaVina, on temporary detail to  the Philippine delegation in Bonn, reports that U.S. silence meant that there  was no U.S. rhetoric attacking developing countries, and consequently greater  willingness by developing countries to be flexible in their approach to the  Protocol.
 
And resentment of the U.S. position helped to  unify negotiators.  Francois Bayrou, a member of the European Parliament  and French presidential candidate, told me that support for the Kyoto Protocol  and opposition to the U.S. position is one of the most reliable applause lines  in speeches he gives all over Europe.
 
The second irony is that U.S. isolation will  deprive U.S. industries of three things they eagerly sought in any climate  agreement:
 
1. Clear and certain rules that enable companies  to make rational decisions on energy related investments that will last 10, 20,  30 or more years.  It remains unclear when the U.S. will enact policies  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or what those policies will  be.
 
2.  The ability to purchase credits from  other countries.  The trading system will be set up under the Protocol  for countries that are participating.
 
3.  The ability to receive credits for  investment in measures that reduce emissions in developing countries through the  "Clean Development Mechanism".  The CDM too, will operate under the  Protocol, which will be designed by and operated for parties.
 
It seems obvious that this will raise the costs  and reduce flexibility for the U.S.  when we decide to make  reductions.  Even the Wall Street Journal editorial page admitted to  harboring "a certain fondness for one part of the Kyoto treaty - emissions  trading."
 
An encouraging development in the U.S.:   Last week I was invited to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs  Committee on a bill that would require the U.S. to develop a long-term strategy  for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The first witness was the  snowy-haired chairman of the Appropriations Committee and former Majority Leader  of the Senate, Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, the author with Senator Stevens of  Alaska of the bill under discussion.  Senator Byrd has been an effective  advocate for his state and its coal industry, and often an opponent of clean air  legislation.  In 1997, with Senator Hagel of Nebraska, he authored a  resolution calling on the U.S. to reject any agreement that failed to impose  mandated emissions reductions on developing countries.  That resolution has  been cited by White House spokespersons as reason for the U.S. to withdraw from  the Kyoto process.
 
Last week Senator Byrd delivered a powerful  statement on the urgency of addressing global climate change, saying "make no  mistake about it, global climate change is a reality."  He said he did not  believe his 1997 resolution "should be used as an excuse for the United States  to abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to the global  climate change dilemma."  He expressed optimism that the United States is  "particularly well positioned with the talent, the wisdom, and the drive" to  lead efforts to control global warming.
 
The U.S. has painted itself into a corner with  global consequences.  The White House appears to have miscalculated the  importance of the issue, the seriousness of our allies, and the capacity of U.S.  industry to respond.  I think that in the next three years - with the White  House, or without it - the United States will take action on climate.  That  Wall Street Journal  editorial I mentioned urged the  Administration to propose an emissions cap and trading system.  It would be  a good start...the sooner the better.
