Doug - 

Pursuant to the strict written instructions I have received from Credit, and 
in accordance with our standing policy, we will not be issueing the User ID 
and Welcome Letter to Tenaska until AFTER Credit approval has been granted.

That being said however, we understand the sense of urgency, and have:

1) verified the authority of the User
2) created the User ID and Welcome Letter
3) prepared same for mailing
4) confirmed with the Mail Room that overnight delivery will have the package 
to the customer by 10am next day.

So, you can assured that there will be ABSOLUTELY NO DELAY on the behalf of 
PCG once we have received the appropriate credit approval.

Dale

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

"Tentatively approved" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

See below.  No e-dash necessary.....

I have already informed accounting and will do the same for treasury.  I was 
told treasury needs to know by 2:00 pm today if the funds need to be wired 
tomorrow.

I will call soon to discuss.  I am still working on the outstanding 
receivable amount.  According to physical settlements (Darla Saucier) they 
only owe us $1,190,803 for December gas on both deals, $789,973 for the one 
month deal and $400,830 for the 10-year deal.

Jay Williams in Credit is verifying this and we will check in TAG to make 
sure we are not missing a deal.

Eric,

I spoke to Dave Gorte regarding this National Steel transaction, and he 
indicated that he did not think the EDASH was necessary as there is no risk 
in the transaction as we are only closing an existing position.  It is 
clearly a funding issue, and we need to be certain that Joe and the Treasury 
group are aware of the exact dollars going out on which day.  Please give me 
a call to discuss.

Thanks,
Tanya

I received a copy of a referral form that you completed for Virgil Haney.  
However, a copy of his resume was not attached.  Please send me a copy of 
Virgil's resume.  We cannot process this referral without it.  I think that a 
recruiter sent it to me but, I don't know which one.

Jason

I have another counterparty that is interested in doing a gas deal.  They are 
smaller but we are trying to do some gas deals with these smaller 
counterparties so that they will potentially do some power deals with us.

Calgary Winter Club
4611 14 Street NW
Calgary, Alberta 
Canada
TT2K 1J7

Contact person:  Gary Maher
Number:  403-289-5511

I have included the file below which outlines the potential volumes we would 
be looking at with this counterparty.

Give me a call if you have any questions on this.

Regards,

Shawn

Jay,

I wanted to send an e-mail to Imperial Sugar regarding the credit terms that 
we just talked about.  I wanted to run this e-mail by you first before I send 
it to  the customer.

Before entering into any trades, Imperial needs to post initial margin of 
$2MM with Enron.  Enron will continue to hold this cushion amount of margin 
as long as Imperial has any positions on with Enron.

Enron has the right to margin Imperial any time their MTM exposure to Enron 
exceeds $1.5MM.  We will margin in increments of $25,000.  If their exposure 
drops below $1.5MM we will return margin to them.  However, we will always 
maintain the cushion of $2MM.

Thanks,
Craig

Bob,

Per Jay Williams, credit does not have a problem with Belco assigning the two 
deals to ENA.

I just heard back from credit.... No e-dash is required.  So just let us know 
if you are wanting to transact today and we will speak with Mike.

Subject: City of Mesa Update

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to "e-dash" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

In the spirit of Christmas, God bless you every one, but grades are not
changed after the fact.

I thought of you guys when I saw the announcement of Oldsmobile's
demise. Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, let me
remind you that the assignment was to think about the basis for
attitudes and how one might changes attitudes, and, by giving up and
shutting down Oldsmobile, you were basically taking a whiff on the
assignment. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm tempted to
see if your grades can be reduced.

Anyway, it's good to hear from you. I hope that things are going well
for all of you.

Jay,

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E 
days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message 
on...

Bill -

The following are some issues that I have encountered that merit some 
attention from a Credit Risk Mgmt. standpoint.  Most of these issues are 
related to the way other groups within the company do their jobs, so we need 
to think about how much political capital would be expended to make some 
changes happen, and whether it is worth it to fight those battles.


1.  VERBAL APPROVAL FOR TRADES

I spoke to one of the day gas traders last week, and she informed me that 
their group had recently had a meeting to discuss issues related to credit.  
In particular, they were discussing the Credit Watch List.  It was made very 
clear to those traders that if they executed a transaction with a 
counterparty on the Watch List without Credit approval that they would be 
fired.  This is, of course, good news and bad news.  The good news is that we 
should now be able to better monitor these transactions.  The bad news is 
that this puts a burden on Credit to keep the Watch List up-to-date.  We 
should be doing this, but it is an issue of freeing up enough time to review 
the companies that we think might merit removal from the list.  Easier said 
than done.

The inevitable conclusion of this meeting/pronouncement from the traders' 
management is that the traders will now be looking for some way to prove that 
their trade was approved by Credit.  This is going to lead to a need  


2.  COUNTERPARTY NAME ISSUES

It is not a new development that traders call down looking to do a trade and 
they don't know which exact entity that they're dealing with.  In most cases, 
we can figure out where a trade needs to be booked and we can do the proper 
analysis with respect to the trade at hand.  For the counterparties with whom 
we have master agreements and do regular business this is not such a big 
deal; we know the parent entities and the associated subs and trading arms.  
However, this issue of traders not knowing who they are dealing with is 
creating a lot of problems for CPR/day gas transactions.  Traders are calling 
down for approval on monthly/day gas and giving the wrong counterparty name 
so our credit analysis is absolutely worthless.  

For example,   I approved a deal for Alain Diza for a small volume of January 
gas for "Fulton County (NY) Board of Education."  The total receivable was 
$36,000 so I approved the trade, reasoning that a county board of education 
would be able to cover a $36k bill.  It turns out that the actual 
counterparty was "Fulton Housing Authority", an operator of low-income 
housing governed by the New York State Division of Housing.  This entity has 
a total of $52,000 in its bank accounts.  The solution is to make 
traders/originators accountable for providing the correct counterparty name.  
If credit losses arising from this issue were deducted from the appropriate 
trader's P&L, then there would be a lot more incentive for them to get the 
entity specified correctly.


3.  BACK OFFICE ISSUES

It is very difficult for us to chase down the originator of a trade through 
TAGG, because the back office aren't doing their jobs well.  When we have 
pendings issues, we have to chase down the trader through the confirms people 
or the book admins.  It is a process that takes too much of our time.  If the 
book admins would just put the trader's name on the ticket, it would save us 
countless phone calls.  I have mentioned to Debbie that we need to pound 
Sally Beck on this issue, and she said that she would discuss it with her.  
However, Beck's group still is not getting it done.

		 To: All RAC Houston & London Employees
		 cc: 
		 Subject: RAC Teams

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams 
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC 
and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a 
catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Subject: GAS DEAL w/Oregon Steel Mills

Gas team,

Dave Fuller in West Origination is trying to get the credit requirements for 
the following 3 year gas financial deal:

Term:  01/01/2001 thru 12/31/2003
Volumes:  7,500MMBtu/day
ENA pays float (Sumas Inside Ferc)
CP pays fixed ($$$$???)

Since I need to get the fixed price for this deal, hypothectically though, 
the cp is a "credit upfront" customer.  Assuming prevailing market prices, 
what would your estimated Letter of Credit be for the deal above?  I've sent 
a cws to legal for a draft ISDA.

Quick response appreciated.  Please let me know if you need more info to swag 
this L/C.  I would assume that we need lots of cushion should the market tank.

Tracy

Subject: Oldsmobile



Dr. Blair,

You probably do not remember us, but oh, we remember you.  It was you who
taught us the ways of Marketing in the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of
Management in the fall of 1996.  It  was you who challenged us with a
particular project.  It was you who openly and categorically disagreed with
our recommendation (giving each of us a less than satisfactory grade of
"B").  It was you who thought the brand name Oldsmobile could and should be
saved with Marketing hocus pocus and wizardry.  It was we three who
recommended that General Motors discontinue the Oldsmobile line, moving the
one or two "best sellers" in the ridiculous line of cars to Buick or
Chevrolet.  As we recall:

Oldsmobile had blown its image with the failing "This is not your
father's Oldsmobile" campaign.
Oldsmobile could not afford to retool its line.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a safety standpoint.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a luxury standpoint.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from an affordability standpoint.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a dependability standpoint.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a sex appeal standpoint.

Let's face it, Ed:  Oldsmobile simply was not competitive on any front, and
as we argued (and as our classmates supported), there was no hope.  In
1996, Oldsmobile had suffered a 90% downturn in car sales over the course
of a decade and its cars did not appeal to any facet of the population.
They were expensive, poorly engineered, unattractive, and basically had
been at the bottom of their respective performance/satisfaction ratings
across the board.

Attached are some articles for your review.  Themes constant across these
articles are those that we expounded four years ago.  Two questions remain:

1) How much money has Oldsmobile vomitted over the last four years?

2)  Can grades be changed four years after the fact?



Yours Truly -

John Suttle (JGS Class of 1997)
Jay Williams (JGS Class of 1997)
Greg Egan (JGS Class of 1997)

Jason

Devon Energy also has appx. [$12MM to $15MM] of monthly exposure to EOTT 
Energy Operating, LP.

We are requesting the ability to "carve out" $30MM (2 months sales) from the 
existing Enron Guaranty to cover any exposure that we have with EOTT.

We could document this a letter agreement attached to the current guaranty. 

Please advise

Tanya -

An update on National Steel Corporation:  the unwind/monetization deal was 
closed today with this counterparty.  I am still trying to get details, but 
it is my impression that we wrote NSC a check to cover the out-of-the-money 
position, with a net-out for December gas invoices only.

I say "only" because I had made it clear to Troy Black, Frank Hayden, John 
Griffith, and anyone else involved that I was not willing to write a check to 
this counterparty without deducting 100% of the amounts owed to Enron by 
National Steel.  While I'm still working on getting details,

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to "e-dash" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Crestar Energy Inc. was amalgamated into Gulf Canada Resources Limited, 
effective January 1, 2001.  We currently have financial master agreements 
with both counterparties.  Please see the attached memo regarding the 
existing masters and let us know which agreement should be terminated.

Also, as a reminder, I am attaching a memo from December regarding Southern 
Pacific/Union Pacific merger.  One of these agreements will also need to be 
terminated.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Team - 

We need to draw up an Omnibus confirmation for the above referenced deal.  
The Enron entity transacting is Enron Canada Corp. but as I understand, this 
is to be done out of the Houston legal group, using the usual Schedule B 
attached to the GTC.  If this is not the case, someone please speak up.  The 
deal is pending credit being put into the contract and Legal's review of 
contracts.  Peter - do you want to sign-off on this prior to the confirmation 
being sent or do you want Houston Legal to sign-off?

The counterparty is Slater Steel Inc. and the terms are as attached.  
Veronica - please have this counterparty set up in Global counterparty and 
have the deal entered into Credit -Ag as we would enter a Master (to allow us 
to monitor exposure/collateral thresholds/collateral held etc. on a 
go-forward basis).

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks - 

John

Juan -

G'Day.  Hey, mate, I got a call from Mike Midden at ANZ Bank, looking for a 
guaranty from Enron Corp. for FX trading of Enron Japan.  He said that YOU 
had given him MY name as the contact for this in your absence.  Imagine my 
surprise when he asked for the status!!!!  Boy, that was THE BEST.  I told 
him that you had been fired and I was hot on your heels to the unemployment 
office and not to put any faith in either of us.

He didn't think it was too funny.

In any case, what IS the deal with this guarantee?  What are you doing on 
this, John?  Tell me!!!!

If anything, life sucks worse.  There is a guy
retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other
projects that I haven't had any time to pick his
brain.  So I am fucked but large.

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

Its raining today, also.

Dr. Blair,

You probably do not remember us, but oh, we remember you.  It was you who 
taught us the ways of Marketing in the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of 
Management in the fall of 1996.  It  was you who challenged us with a 
particular project.  It was you who openly and categorically disagreed with 
our recommendation (giving each of us a less than satisfactory grade of 
"B").  It was you who thought the brand name Oldsmobile could and should be 
saved with Marketing hocus pocus and wizardry.  It was we three who 
recommended that General Motors discontinue the Oldsmobile line, moving the 
one or two "best sellers" in the ridiculous line of cars to Buick or 
Chevrolet.  As we recall:

Oldsmobile had blown its image with the failing "This is not your father's 
Oldsmobile" campaign.
Oldsmobile could not afford to retool its line.
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a safety standpoint.  
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a luxury standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from an affordability standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a dependability standpoint. 
Oldsmobile was not competitive from a sex appeal standpoint. 

Let's face it, Ed:  Oldsmobile simply was not competitive on any front, and 
as we argued (and as our classmates supported), there was no hope.  In 1996, 
Oldsmobile had suffered a 90% downturn in car sales over the course of a 
decade and its cars did not appeal to any facet of the population. They were 
expensive, poorly engineered, unattractive, and basically had been at the 
bottom of their respective performance/satisfaction ratings across the board.

Attached are some articles for your review.  Themes constant across these 
articles are those that we expounded four years ago.  Two questions remain: 
 
1) How much money has Oldsmobile vomitted over the last four years?

2)  Can grades be changed four years after the fact?  



Yours Truly - 

John Suttle (JGS Class of 1997)
Jay Williams (JGS Class of 1997)
Greg Egan (JGS Class of 1997)

There are several outstanding issues currently with Tenaska--the most 
significant being their change in ownership.  They are no longer an 
affilitate/sub of Illinova Corp. (As Illinova has been acquired by Dynegy), 
but have now seperated into the entities Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska 
Energy Holdings (their financials are combined).  The Guarantor is 
collectively both entities.

I'm currently working on amending the Master Swap Agreement, as the credit 
support provider has changed.  Preliminary revised thresholds are between 
$5-10MM.  ENA has not Mac'd the counterparty b/c the Illinova's gty, etc. 
will remain acitve until April 01.  Nontheless, we need to amend accordingly 
ASAP.  Our current Financial MTM is $9MM.  I will also contact the physical 
legal group to have a new contract issued out (as we have an old 91 Master 
Physical Gas contract).

On the physical side, attached below is a breakdown of our positions.  Please 
note that we have formal gas netting agreements for the ENA business:



As you can see, the majority of the exposure is with the Canadian sales to 
their Canadian affitliate.  Also note that all of this business is still 
gty'd by Illinova until April 01.  

An important note here is that I received a gty from the new guarantors today 
in the amount of $20MM, covering Enron Corp and all of its' subs.  It covers 
the physical business of Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Tenaska Marketing 
Canada, a Division of TMV Corp., and Tenaska Gas Storage, LLC.  Tenaska is 
also doing business with EES.  Once the ISDA is amended, the new financial 
gty's will be issued out accordingly.  Also, I'm working with Global 
Counterparty to change the system accordingly.

I will keep you all updated on any changes/progress.   Please let me know if 
I've left anything out.

Veronica

Please review the attached Response to RFB for the California Department of 
Water Resources as soon as possible and let me know of any material changes 
we need to make.   

Although it is important to make the document as accurate and polished as 
possible, we do not have the luxury of incorporating stylistic or similar 
non-material changes at this time.

The format has changed somewhat from versions distributed earlier in order to 
reduce the length of the cover letter. 

Chris Calger will execute the letter.

Please provide any comments you have to me within the next 15 minutes (sorry 
about that--the deadline is upon us).

Thanks.

The equity of Edison International and PG&E will trade substantially higher 
at the opening today ....


01/25 08:57 Western Gas extends gas deliveries to PG&E 

NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Western Gas Resources Inc. <WGR.N> said Thursday 
it will deliver an additional 5,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu) of 
gas per day through Feb. 7 to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pursuant to recent 
orders issued by the U.S. secretary of energy. 

According to the Temporary Emergency Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Orders, 
issued by the secretary of energy on Jan. 19 and 23, Western Gas will make 
the deliveries under terms consistent with a terminated supply agreement, 
excluding any terms requiring prepayment, the company said in a statement. 

The 5,000 mmBtu/day represents less than one-half of one percent of PG&E's 
typical daily supply requirements of 1.44 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day 
for the month of January. 

PG&E is a regulated energy delivery company serving northern and central 
California. The utility is owned by energy holding company PG&E Corp. <PCG.N> 
of San Francisco. 

The utility, which serves 3.8 million gas customers in the the region, said 
earlier in the week it has piled up more than $7 billion in wholesale power 
costs, which cannot be passed on to customers because of a rate cap imposed 
by the state's 1996 deregulation law. 

California, which experienced two days of rolling blackouts last week in the 
northern and central parts of the state, continues to see paper-thin power 
reserve levels. 

Western, an independent natural gas company based in Denver, estimates it 
will have total invoices outstanding pursuant to the terminated supply 
agreement and including deliveries through the duration of these orders 
totaling $2.2 million. 

Western said it has no other outstanding exposure to either PG&E or 
California's other regulated energy delivery company, Southern California 
Edison Co. 

Southern California Edison, which serves customers in southern California, is 
a subsidiary of energy holding company Edison International <EIX.N> of 
Rosemead, Calif. 

"Western will comply with the Department of Energy's orders and sympathizes 
with the citizens of California during this period of uncertainty, however, 
we believe that this issue is best addressed by PG&E, the California Public 
Utilities Commission and the State of California," Western Chief Executive 
and President Lanny Outlaw said in the statement. 

"We have difficulty understanding how our company, our employees in Colorado, 
Wyoming, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma, and our shareholders can 
be expected to bear any loss as a result of these orders. We intend to 
vigorously act to recover any losses and protect our numerous stakeholders," 
Outlaw added.

Sorry guys - I inadvertently hit send without the following comment.  You can 
delete the previous version of this.

Based on my conversation with Debbie this morning, we can send it out today.  
If we do this, there is a better chance they will have a chance to look at 
the site on Thursday late afternoon before actually transacting.

"Tentatively approved" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access 
until we hear from you tomorrow?

To All:

This update clarify's our trading position with the Sempra relationship on 
EOL and over the phone:
-All Sempra entities on EOL should maintain their term of 36 months.  This is 
approved as a result of the credit controls of EOL.
-Trading over the phone is OK inside 12 months and should be managed between 
12 and 36 months accordingly based on the transaction, counterparty current
exposure, contract collateral rights and credit reserve, if any. 
-Exposures should be monitored daily by all members of the credit group.

SDG&E Update:
Short Term Power transactions are OK via phone transactions only.

Subject: Sempra and San Diego Gas & Electric Trading Policy

To All:

Per myself, Jason Williams and Bill Bradford, we have set forth a near term 
trading policy with Sempra and SDG&E in light of the California Power 
concerns. Please see below:

Sempra trading relationship:
Maintain all trading (any commodity) with in one year.  Transactions outside 
of one year need to be approved on a one off basis with due analysis and 
credit reserve if necessary.

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E):
Financial and Physical Gas- limit trading to inside three months, no 
transactions outside of this term.
No Power transactions.

These relationships will be reviewed and updated once the California 
Legislature finalizes its Power bid's.


Regards,
Russell

Chip,

Pursuant to my voice message, attached please find the term sheet that I 
believe has already been circulating in Houston.  Spoke with Dave Fuller 
earlier re. the "all in package" that ENA West Orig. has presented to the 
cp.  Dave asked for the cp to provide some feedback no later than this coming 
Monday.  Figured RAC could scrub the package and find ways to structure the 
contracts in order to reduce credit risk.  FYI, Jay Williams and I have done 
a credit analysis on the cp in the past when working on the previous RFP's 
that we've responded to.

I will try and speak with Jay W. by the end of today to scrub the deal from a 
credit perspective.  Perhaps you could help with the asset/dispatch rights 
that ENA would have.

Lets speak soon.

Regards,
Tracy

Hello, my friend Jay W.

I just wanted to say what a great day I am having.  I
am at peace with my surroundings and getting up to go
to work is the highlight of every day, because it
interrupts the nagging sleep that cuts into work time.
I have a constant smile and my cheerfullness is
rubbing off on others.  We are all a happy family.  I
am sure that your life is the same.  I hope that I can
live to be 200 years old and that I am allowed to work
that long, because every second at the office is an
eternity of serene enlightenment.

God Bless you, friend, and peace be with you.

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

TNgo -

A bit of a gray area.  There are SOME credit terms in the ISDA draft, but no 
collateral threshold.  You'll have to sell this to Fuller to collect on your 
wine...



Always Here For You, TNgo,

Tana -

Attached is the ISDA worksheet for Clark County, Washington.  You will note 
that this worksheet indicates no collateral threshold, as Clark County is a 
counterparty that will require a contract where we maintain no collateral 
rights.  NOTE TO TRACY AND DAVE:  If you feel like we can get Clark County 
PUD to agree to margin rights, then we should (obviously) try to put a draft 
in front of them with a threshold and margin rights.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,

Jay

Russell,

As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the 
summary....

ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of 
$3.74/mmbtu.  It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in 
July 2001.
City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index 
(physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002.
They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu 
and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu

The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you 
need for your analysis.


Again, the orginators (Dave Fuller and Jeffrey Oh, Portland) are looking to 
transact on Monday (Jan 22).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will touch base with you 
mid-morning on Monday.

Thanks in advance,

Eric

Don--

I apologize for not getting back with you sooner, but it's been really crazy 
around here.  Jason Williams (a manager here in the credit group) and I have 
reviewed Black Hills and can accept a parental Gty in the amount of $7.5MM to 
cover financial and physical transactions with Enron North America Corp.  I 
have attached a Gty draft below for you to review.  

However, to cover the current physical business between ENA and Enserco, we 
still need to obtain an increase in the current L/C.  We have an estimated 
$4.8MM outstanding (with the bulk of the exposure stemming from December 
sales to Enserco).  As we discussed before, we can look at decreasing the 
Enron Canada L/C to cover the increase that is needed.  

Please give me a call to discuss our positions at 713-646-6002.



Thanks,

Veronica Espinoza

Mary,

Linder Oil Company, A Partnership- ENA is currently purchasing approximately 
620,000/mmbtu/firm/month through March'01 under GTC contracts.  The current 
dollar value of this notional volume is approximately $5.5MM.  No outstanding 
financial trades exist.

Linder Energy Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap (nb3995.2) 
for 6,500/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market value of 
this trade is approximately $7.3MM.  The Annex B that was attached to this 
omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $600M credit 
line and specified an additional amount of $700M.  We received and continue 
to hold an LC for $700M to secure the additional amount, but made no other 
margin call.

Lousiana General Oil Company - ENA is currently long one financial swap 
(nb3939.2) for 1,625/mmbtu/d Cal'01 @ $2.755.  The financial mark to market 
value of this trade is approximately $1.8MM.  The Anned B that was attached 
to this omnibus confirmation contained credit language that provided a $100 
credit line and specified an additional amount of $175M.  We received and 
continue to hold an LC for $175M to secure the additional amount, but made no 
other margin call.

This morning we called Linder Energy and Louisiana General for margin.  They 
can't post.  We would like to assign the two outstanding financial trades to 
Linder Oil Company and put into place language that would allow 
physical/financial offset in an early termination event.

Could you please give me a call on this when you get a chance.

thanks
brant

Hey, dude.  I need some help digging up some financial info on a new trading 
counterparty.  I prepared an ISDA draft about two months ago for FleetBoston 
Financial Group, the mega-huge, mega-powerful awesome credit banking 
company.  Tana Jones called me last week to inform me that they DIDN'T want 
to trade out of this entity but instead out of Fleet National Bank, which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Jennifer Shipos is a gas trader on Craig Breslau's desk (Mid-Markets) and she 
asked me to look at Praxair from a credit standpoint.  She apparently is 
going to sell them some gas, but they are also interested in buying power.

Thanks for your kind words, my friend.  Your thoughtfulness has added 
immeasurable joy to my already immeasurably joyous day.  Indeed, I would say 
that this is the Greatest Day of My Life except that I know tomorrow will be

Hello, my friend Jay W.

I just wanted to say what a great day I am having.  I
am at peace with my surroundings and getting up to go
to work is the highlight of every day, because it
interrupts the nagging sleep that cuts into work time.
I have a constant smile and my cheerfullness is
rubbing off on others.  We are all a happy family.  I
am sure that your life is the same.  I hope that I can
live to be 200 years old and that I am allowed to work
that long, because every second at the office is an
eternity of serene enlightenment.

God Bless you, friend, and peace be with you.

"Tentatively approved" means that we should assume that Tenaska will be 
granted full approval unless we hear otherwise from Debbie, Bill, or Jason 
Williams by COB Thursday.  

Please mail the letter and UserID out to Tenaska today.   I have set up the 
counterparty in CL system with appropriate interest rates and privileges, and 
you guys in PCG should set up the user as usual in the CL system.  

I really appreciate everyone's speed on this issue;  I believe that there is 
a good chance Tenaska will want to transact on Friday.  I told them the 
earliest they would be able to do so was Friday, pending our usual setup 
processes and credit check.

thanks again!

Debbie - 

Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access 
until we hear from you tomorrow?
