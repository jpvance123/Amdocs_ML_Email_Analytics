Subject:	New Albany

As you may or may not know, we are in the processing of selling New Albany.  Does the Capacity Payment that was marked in January $12.5MM need to be unwound with the sale?  If so, what is the impact if it is unwound at 9/30/01.  I am putting together a calculation on the gain or loss on sale and I need this information before it can be distributed.

Thanks!

Apparently this book has already been set up in GCP and you mentioned below that it is also set up in ERMS.  I don't know why it was set up in ERMS since it's a power book but make sure to mention this to the GCP team.  Also, make sure to place this book in the hierarchy under AGG-ACCRUALS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Susan,

This emails relates to your email of last Thursday asking us to create this accrual book.  When you have some time, let's discuss this one.  I looked in Risktrac and this one is not there, but it is in ERMS.  How does this happen?  Should this book be placed in the AGG Accruals hierarchy?  

Please advise. I will hold off on adding anything until we can discuss.

Thank you.

The book I requested is actually already set up in GCP.  I looked for it on the Active/Inactive website and could not find it, so I assumed it was not in RisktRAC.  This book just needs to be added to the Accrual Hierarchy in RisktRAC.

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.

Hey guys, I would like to get with you to discuss our hedge policies.  I am concerned about the recent accounting around the wind hedge (and not necessarlily the outcome in this particular case!).  If the outcome had been reversed (ie. a loss on the hedges existed) we would have had no choice but to book it.  The issue is that nobody commmunicated or documented the designation of these positions as hedges of the "wind" PPA.  It occurs to me that we do not have any process that requires coodination when you set up an accrual book. As you know the designation criteria are rigid for acctg purposes.  If we miss it, we can't cure it and the acctg would be MTM for the life of the contracts.  I will set a metting to discuss.

Wes

Stacey just wanted to give you a heads up regarding a problem that credit is running into here. Ed Sacks is up here right now and there is a fairly large credit risk with Smurfit (deal 403522). The delivery point for this deal is Montana System border whose curve has not been updated in about 6 weeks. Currently the MTM on the deal is 8.4MM, but once Mike updates the curve it will create a MTM of about 17MM which is what credit is expecting based on the corrected basis curve. According to Ed, Smurfit is currently a credit risk. 

Mike gave no explanation as to why he has not been updating the curve but he said he will take care of it tomorrow. I just wanted to give you a heads up in case Debbie Bracket tries to get in touch with you. Ed isn't sure what will happen, if anything, from this but he is just advising us of the situation. There is a fairly large position at this delivery point, so I am confused as to why the curves were not being updated. Unless I am missing something, shouldn't curves be kept up to date as long as there are deals at that delivery point?

I will check with Cara Sempberger regarding the Services deal type. Regarding the profit sharing, the services desk enters annuities with the appropriate counterparty or other trading desk to capture that p/l.

You should check with Scheduling re: the deal type because they are the ones who requested it be set up (I think).  Regarding the services desk, what type of profit sharing do we have with the counterparties they are doing business for?  It differs by deal.  I just want to make sure we know how they are capturing the deals when it is a profit sharing arrangement.

Nobody here uses that deal type. It is not even possible to bring it up in the deal types area when you are searching for specific deals. As far as the services book goes, they have only done fwds, a few index fwd deals and the odd transmission deal. We treat that book just as we do the others in ensuring accurate p/l. They don't do anything unusual that would make me question the accuracy. The only problem of any significance is PMA adjustments for some of their backdated deals and deals that had liquidated in other books before the Services desk was set up.

Please send me an e-mail highlighting who uses the Services deal type, for what deals, where all these deals show up, trouble with the deal type and anything else you find out about them.  Also, highlight for me the transactions in the Services desk and what our group does to ensure that the right p&l is recorded for Enron.

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a "?" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is "wait 60 days on PX"..."annuity 4 sale back to them".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

Rick and Greg:

Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she, Beth Apollo and I discussed recently.  

Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.  

In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.  

Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.  

We are creating a steering committee and project management office for this project with operations, RAC and IT members that will be appropriate, but not too large.  We want to focus on getting the work done.  I will gladly update all on this distribution list in the next 10 days on  our finalized steering committee, project managers, definition of outcomes from the project and planned completion dates.  We look forward to the opportunity to solve this data discrepancy issue in a definitive way.  --Sally

Subject:	Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

Below is 670939 confirm.  The 3 deals were executed under the WSPP.  Shari Stack approved this special confirm.  Even though the commodity is Schedule A (non-firm), the deal is for firm power.  The other 2 executed confirms have not been scanned into Livelink but it does show that they are executed.  Let me know if you need more information.

The loss is part of the $1.45 million.  The loss occurred due to generator repairs.

Please let me know what you have found out about the following costs (see red section below) related to New Albany.  I have to account for these by Monday afternoon (final month-end DPR), at the latest, so I need to know if you are taking the hits in your book or if Lavo is reimbursing you from office of the chair.

Theresa,
 
I think that it might make sense to visit briefly about your calculation.  As you mentioned, OEC is supposed to be paid certain amounts and will have various obligations to pay significant portions of the amounts paid to it to third parties.  In addition, the latest estimate of the costs to fix the Unit #3 generator is $1.45 million (without any reimbursement from insurance proceeds).  I just want to make sure that your calculation has everything in it because a few minor things have changed.
 
Finally, relative to the possibility of a third quarter close, we are at the mercy and timing of the FERC and cannot close without the required regulatory approval even if both Duke and Enron desire to do so.
 
Regards
 
Stuart

Stuart/Jon - I have updated the Loss calc for New Albany with actuals thru August.  Forecasted Loss is $1.1MM.  Please let me know if you have any changes to the reserve.  Any OEC costs associated with closing the facility will be accrued in September to the LLC and are not included as part of this calc.  Please call me with any questions.

Trey/Susan - I just found out yesterday that they are trying to close this next week - 3rd quarter deal.

Subject:	Curve Changes

In conjunction with a new "curve layout" requested by Kevin Presto, we will be carrying out several curve changes for East Power.  I wanted to go ahead and send what curve requests I had available currently, but I will be sending additional ones as I complete them.  The new curve requests are as follows:


   


Also, we are requesting that several curves be made "inactive" and they are as follows:

R1H - NE Dispatch
R2B - Eastern Ecar
B11 - Wisconsin
B33 - NY Zone D


Please DO NOT hesitate to call me if you have any questions!  This is not a joyous project, I know, so I greatly appreciate your help!!

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.

	The migration freeze has ended and the EnPower database was moved to a new and more powerful server Saturday.  I received feedback from those parties testing Deal Entry, Deal Blotter and FSP's EnPowerDealLibrary. Currently we are planning to migrate the applications with Legal Entities at COB today.  Please let me know if you have any concerns.  After one day with the new applications, we will run the script to populate the Legal Entities columns for existing deals (Tuesday night.)  Finally, on Thursday we will remove the Legal Entities columns from Deal Peers (which were never populated.)

FYI - these reccomendations all look reasonable to me.

Greg, please have someone in your group formalize a policy type document with timelines, responsible parties, etc. for this.  I believe that I sent you Stacey's original communication.

Subject:	Re: FW: Accrual Book Procedures


Tom looked over these procedures today, but he did not have many comments.
I think the procedures should have timing requirments and documentation
requirements.  Here are some of my thoughts:
   Required communication of accrual transactions on date of execution
   Notification of accrual transactions to Financial Operations and Risk
   Controls via deal tickets, deal confirmations, deal "write-ups", etc.
   Required deal "write-up" explaining transaction purpose and basis for
   accrual accounting (this would not be the full blown 133 documentation
   that Financial Operations would prepare)
   Daily DPR should be provided to John Lavorato and/or Wes Colwell
   Weekly/Monthly DPR should be provided to Financial Operations and Market
   Risk Management (this will help RAC implement the risk policy)
   The last point in Stacey's email states that Fin Ops will communicate
   disclosures to Risk Mgmt. - I think Risk Mgmt. should assist Fin Ops. in
   gathering necessary disclosure data
   The procedures need to specify the level of individual that will be
   notified of the accrual transactions

These are just some items I thought through.  I did not go over these
specifically with Tom, but I think he would be supportive of all of these
items.  Let me know what you think.

The project that Wanda mentioned in her original note is not meant to inclu=
de every operational measurement.  Frankly, an initiative that broad would =
be bogged down and simply wouldn't work.  Look for a separate e-mail respon=
se from me that adds some additional clarification to Wanda's good summary =
of the project at hand. =20

So that efforts are not unnecessarily duplicated, I would suggest that you =
and I get together so that I can share with you the processes and the repor=
ting that we do on a continuing basis relative to operational analysis (the=
 term that we have used for several years for the old flash to actual monik=
er) , cash collection, A/R collection, and confirmation creation and execut=
ion.  I know that Leslie Reeves reviewed our cash collections memos and ope=
rating reports with Wanda and Rick Carson.  Rick called me afterwards and l=
iked what he saw.  We have some more established reporting tools in the US,=
 and Mike Jordan has been providing me with operating reports recently from=
 London as well.  These types of reports are on the radar screen for EES, b=
ut we have had bigger fish to fry than creating the reports  -- such as sim=

rthur Andersen, all of the aforementioned processes are audited annually.  =
The A/R review is complete and has been issued for 2001.  Other reviews are=

I would hate to see separate initiatives kicked off around these operationa=

I believe this will give us a good sense of the validity of the information=
 we rely on to make the assessments about risk that we are expected to make=
. I have mentioned this concept before - I envisioned an application (possi=
bly using our 3d tools) that would allow an interested user to assess data =
flow visually, similar to the way we control our physical assets and commod=
ity flow at ETS, for example.

The other key techniques whose results I believe we need comfort on are the=
 "flash-to-actual" reconciliations, the process of tracking and chasing con=
firmations and perhaps cash collection/payment analyses. I think you may ha=
ve included these in your point "4", these all point in some way to the eff=
icacy of the mark-to-market results (which underpin most of the risk metric=
s we utilize), and trends in them, (or an absence of the analysis altogethe=
r), can indicate impending "controls" issues of the type we have witnessed =
here - so I'm a big fan.

Let me know if you need anything further from me.

Subject:=09Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk ma=
nagement initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applic=
ations.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all d=
ata from=20
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR=
, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultima=
tely the DPR. =20

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and moni=
tor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope inclu=
des a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, t=
iming of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and =
improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization =
process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basi=
s, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliat=
ion initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to=
 combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips. =20
   =20
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics n=
ot currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of infor=
mation which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures=
".  How complete is the data?=20

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all fai=
lures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of =
books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.=20

The following is a summary of daily losses attributable to our 5-day rolling loss limit violation.  The majority of the loss was attributable to curve shift in response to various market factors such as warmer than normal temperatures in the front end and mean reversions to market prices subsequent to widespread sell-offs.  A detailed breakdown of curve shift by day is as follows: 


7/3:  The majority of the $(13)M loss was attributable to power curve shift in the following regions: 

Northeast:   $(3.3)M
Midwest:     $(3.3)M 
Southeast:  $(1.5)M
Ercot:  	$(4.6)M

7/5:  The majority of the $(14)M loss was attributable to power curve shift in the following regions:
Midwest:     $(12)M 
Ercot:  	$(1.5)M

7/6:  Power East lost approximately $(21)M in both power and gas curve shift. Power curve shift by region was as follows: 

Northeast:   $(2)M
Midwest:     $(10)M 
Southeast:  $(1)M
Ercot:  	$(1.8)M

An additional loss related to gas curve shift occurred in the following books:

Ercot:    $(2.6)M
Mgmt:   $(2.5)M    


Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks!

The following are consolidated DPR reporting & officialization requirements for the US Thanksgiving holiday which is Thursday, November 22 and Friday, November 23.  All US markets are closed Thursday, and NYMEX is closed Fri, but rate and currency markets are open Friday.

Wednesday's trading -
Consolidated DPR - will be prepared on Monday, the 26th
Officializations - no change to normal procedure

Thursday & Friday's trading - 
Consolidated DPR - since most markets are closed, there will be no consolidated DPR for these days. However, if there is trading; positions, VAR and P&L have to be reviewed against limits, separately from the activity of Wednesday's and Monday's trading.  
Officializations - This holiday marks a change to prior procedures due to an increased need for more complete info in RMS.  Ramesh (RAC IT) is going to run a job to copy Wednesday's numbers for Thursday and Friday for all groups for which he has not received books.  I had spoken to a few of you about performing this copy/roll manually.  This is now not required.

This memo should not affect EEL or IR/FX trading.

Please call if you have questions.

Norman,

I ran a couple of test calcs to follow up our discussion last week re the problem -- The 1-day lag between the financial true-up and option liquidation causes liquidation value falling out of book on the flow date ( the day after expiry).  In summary:

a.  Your suggestion of ture-up to current business day does hold the current day leg in liquidation report, HOWEVER,
b.  It causes problems for index-forward deals

I did a test calc on ST-PJM book, (PostID 12677), and if you compare its swap liquidation report to the official calc (postid 12629), you will see the difference caused by truing  up to current business day.

After talking to Stacey, we think changing the code in portcalc to force it hold the current day leg in liquidation report is probably the best way to correct this problem.  Please let us know what do you think.

Thanks 
Hai

We intend to reserve $5.5 million associated with PX Index-based deals with=
 third parties that we did in January.  The $5.5 million represents the amo=
unt by which we underpaid some of our services customers relative to the PX=
 index.  NO P&L IMPACT.  Amounts currently sitting as annuities in Enpower.=
  We should release this reserve when the California refund case is complet=
ed and new/final PX MCPs are published by FERC.

The story goes like this ... We typically buy power from our services custo=
mers at a PX Index price.  Throughout January we entered PX Index based pur=
chases from our services customers into Enpower.  At the same time, Foster =
was negotiating a certain $150/MWh payment to our customers given all of th=
e noise around the PX, the weird prices that it was printing, and the $150/=
MWh soft price cap that FERC had in place.  We settled with our customers b=
ased on the $150 value.  Most of our customers were fine with this.  To do =
this we entered annuities into Enpower for the difference between the PX pr=
ice and the $150 price.  These annuities have been "hanging out there" sinc=
e January.  We should have run those annuities through the books and reserv=
ed the amount when we settled with our customers (I am assured by Foster an=
d Postelthwaite that we have properly settled with our customers).  Somewhe=
re between our middle market team and our risk group in Portland the annuit=
ies were never run through the books (you may recall that we lost two of ou=
r three people on our risk desk at this same time).  Foster or Wolfe should=
 have caught this.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Dear all,

Just a heads-up to everyone, the Risk will reserve $5,518,289.90 on 10/31/0=
1 in the ST-CA books regarding the following four annuity deals:

#566310=09$1,885,593.81
#566307=09$1,383,042.10
#566313=09$1,539,749.09
#566377=09$   709,904.90
Total=09=09$5,518,289.90

As discussed earlier, since these deals have never come through to ST-CA bo=
ok, we will give this value back to ST-CA while reserving it at the same ti=
me. Therefore, there will be NO P&L impact for ST-CA.=20

Tracy,

We are treating this just like the way we discussed in the last email (10/2=
4). Therefore, you should be able to take them out from the LTD report in N=
ov.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Richter reserved that last year.  He made the money.  It's his.  It goes against refund risk in California.  If we take a hit in CA due to refunds, Richter should eat a good chunk of that hit -- if there is extra money then he should keep it.

John has asked me to do a thorough review of our Schedule C reserves in light of the northwest refund decision, BPA's new contracts that started in October, and the overall lower price environment.  Richter's reserves will be a part of this bigger effort that I will get done this week.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 

Do we need to get together to discuss this?

It is okay with me.

Stacey, since I am coming to Houston on Oct 11 and 12, I was planning to stay over a Sat night to save some money. Without staying over the Sat the ticket is currently at about 1,600 but the ticket I purchased is at about 250. Since I would be in Houston for 5 days I would like Jess to come down at that time. Would Enron be willing to buy Jess' ticket as well since I would be staying over the Sat? Her ticket would be some where around 400 since prices have changed in the last few days. I would be paying for Brandon's ticket.

John

Just wanted you to be aware that a couple of weeks ago we made many curve changes.  We have been in communication with EES, but there continue to be problems.  We may have not communicated with all the correct people.  I know Kenneth Lee, Preston Ochsner, and Jeff Jackson are in the loop, but it seems they are not passing off the communication within EES.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Stacey

Please see e-mail below which was sent to EES on 6/14 regarding the deactivation of the R4A curve.

Thanks.

Preston,

After today, two additional curves will be "inactivated".  They are:

R2 - Ecar
R4A - Mapp

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks.

Dear all,

Because the curve (R4A) for Ontario region was not loaded, I was not able to run portcalc to generate the Enpower report.  However, I will run portcalc again and officialize the report tomorrow morning as early as possible.  I apologize for any inconvenience this caused.

Regards,

Regarding that BPA sch C. The James River deal was torn up when the Open access was taken away. That is why it is not in the system. Mike Swerzbin is expecting open access to return in April and they will put the deal in then and probably release the sch c against it.

I told Trey that we are still obligated to the deal and that we are anticipating the return of open access and the probable release of the sch c. I didn't mention the James River piece.
