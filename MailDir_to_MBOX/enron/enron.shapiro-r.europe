And 5 for continental gas, C&EE, Climate Change Levy

1. Block attempts by GTE (association of European gas transportation 
companies) to establish unacceptable common standards in interconnection and 
interoperability / promote more pro-competitive standards
2. (With Paul Hennemeyer) Promote rTPA to gas pipelines in Germany.
3. Clarification of Climate Change Levy to fit with EES model on outsourcing
4. Cross-border power trades from Czech/Poland into Germany
5. Greek electricity supply licence and access to capacity in Greece-Italy 
Interconnector

It's late (even in Houston!) but here are five for the Brussels office, plus 
Continental Power,  plus France, Belgium and NL:
 1. Arcos gas TPA (anti-trust angles).
 2. Cross border power transmission CWE - eliminating transaction based 
tariffs and achieving transparency/ non discrimination in allocation of ATC.
 3. Freeing up more power export transmission capacity from, and optimising 
forthcoming auction of virtual generating capacity inside, France.
 4. Resolving restrictions on availability to new entrants of power import 
transmission capacity into NL.
 5. Achieving power transit without additional tariff through, and wholesale 
power TPA inside, Belgium.

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.

Please find attached a short overview of Ofgem's recent consultation paper on 
transmission access and transmission losses under NETA. Paul and I are 
discussing this with other Enron UK Power people in an internal meeting on 
Thursday afternoon.

I spoke today to a staff member of the Cabinet of Minister Deleuze, Belgian 
Federal Minister for Energy and Sustainable Development.  As you will know, 
Minister Deleuze will be chair of the EU Environment Ministers as of July 
when Belgium takes over the rotating Presidency of the EU.  Thus he is 
presently intimately concerned with EU follow up to Kyoto.

The Cabinet of Deleuze is taking very seriously reports that Bush will table 
a series of initiatives at the Bonn COP VI meeting, which are designed to get 
the US time to consider a comprehensive new approach to climate change issues 
and will finally ditch consideration of Kyoto (by others). The EU (in my 
opinion) would seek to counter any such 'wrecking tactics' by increasing the 
pressure on the US in the interim (though the sensible political response, 
tabling EU suggestions that the US would have to reject, seems to have eluded 
the EU till now).

The end point of any such plan by Bush would be a US emphasis on trade/market 
based mechanisms, no multilateral approach but bilateral deals, and 
technology transfer.

(If we have any messages on this issue for the EU, this contact would be a 
good input point.)

Incidentally, in Brussels today, Thomas Brewer of the Jorunal of 
International Business Studies, gave a very persuasive account of why the 
Republican leadership is out of touch even with its rank and file membership 
on environmental issues.  He used polling data to indicate this, and the 
suggested conclusion, that Bush will now have to move  'constructively' on 
the issue, was well argued.

Lastly, do we have a contact in Washington who could comment on this?

Carin / Tom,

Please find following document containing main suggested briefing points re 
Polish energy market for GW's visit in June, prepared by Doug with input from 
the rest of the Polish team.

If you have any further questions, it would probably be best to 'reply all' 
and the relevant expert will contact you.

Kind regards

One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was 
good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional 
ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. 
If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I 
could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance 
notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this 
new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to 
where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.

EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET LIBERALIZATION: GATHERING PACE

The European Commission has issued two new documents aimed at furthering
liberalization of the European energy market in the second half of the deca=
de.
The Commission has set both quantitative and qualitative objectives for gas=
=20
and
power. France=01,s opposition to the proposals will delay the implementatio=
n of
market opening as envisaged by the Commission. However, in CERA=01,s view t=
he
rejection of the Commission=01,s draft documents is only a temporary slow d=
own in
the process. Liberalization remains a widely shared objective among member
states and is only gathering pace. CERA expects four principal outcomes fro=
m
the ongoing discussions:

* The pace of market opening will accelerate despite French opposition.

* The scope of unbundling will be extended to include separate ownership.

* A unified European approach for grid regulation will emerge.

* Public service obligation will be institutionalized.

Please see attached a brief overview of the current legal framework for the 
control of NOx emissions in the EU as well as changes under preparation. 
Please note that the two EU directives which govern the current regime of NOx 
emmissions abatement plan on the pan-European level only set the minimum 
requirements. Nothing precludes Member States setting tighter limits on 
emissions when implementing these Directives into their national legislation.

Here's my list:

UK Power.  Address flaws in NETA through inter alia modifications to the 
Balancing and Settlement Code.  Value difficult to quantify, but very large 
given direct costs of high imbalance charges and resultant increase in the UK 
power curve.
UK Power.  Frustrate Ofgem's proposals for locational transmission charging 
which could cost Teesside Power up to o10m p.a. (from memory).
UK Rail.  Continue to prosecute the Competition Act complaint against EWS 
Railways.  This could reduce our rail charges by up to 25% and could create 
opportunities to grow the coal business in the UK further (eg, by unwinding 
existing long-term contracts)
UK Gas. Ofgem plan to move to hourly gas balancing which would represent a 
major risk/cost given our existing flexibility positions.  Objective is to 
shape these proposals to minimise this risk and delay/frustrate their 
introduction.
Spanish Gas/Power (Alfredo Huertas) - gas third party access for the Arcos 
project (don't know exact value, but John Sherriff has described this as his 
No. 1 priority at the moment)
Spanish Gas/Power (Alferdo Huertas) - removal of restrictions on financing 
structures on the Arcos project


I suggest the four of us work on a consolidated list when we have the 
individual lists.

Paul

The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece "Slow Starters" on page 24 discusses
the "entry tax" which is the capital burden for starting a new business.  It 
states that rich countries
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused
by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These "entry hurdles" 
and asscoiated costs
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the 
environment.

We might want to make the analogy of "entry tax" for new deregulated gas & 
power markets.  Things like
negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.
Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what 
they are going to get) and clearly slows
the new comers down.

I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

For the benefit of those copied :
 Most of you know that I represented EFET at Florence. You will not be 
surprised to hear that the Platts and EDEM articles on the outcome give a 
false impression on what is likely to transpire by way of a cross border 
transmission tariff regime on 1 September. It was pretty clear to me from 
both the formal sessions and side discussions, that the impasse between the 
German government and the European Commission will not be resolved in that 
time frame, if at all. The language in the draft Conclusions should give us 
reason for optimism that the Commission will now stand firm against export 
related tariffs. There was talk of a transitional tariffication scheme based 
on socialisation of transit costs among national system users, which would 
exclude Germany and possibly Belgium and Switzerland. I give a scheme like 
that little chance of implementation either, given the practical difficulties 
in operating the scheme without co-operation of the German TSOs, as well as 
the hurdles to reaching a contracual arrangement for exchange of moneys 
between ETSO members.
 
I am available in London on Monday to answer questions. And you can ask 
Nailia Dindarova or me for sight of a draft EFET press statement about the 
implications of the Florence Conclusions this time round.

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.

Solomon Bros reports:

E.ON / POWERGEN - The Guardian reports that the UK government is looking
into ways to block or hold up foreign takeovers of British energy companies.
Separately, E.ON says it now has a majority stake in Sydkraft.

Power in East Europe 

Issue?57 | 14/05/2001

Poland's SOK in limbo as Belchatow withdraws

Will Poland's long-awaited transition levy scheme to dissolve long-term power 
purchase agreement's (PPAs) - System Oplat Kompensacyjnych (SOK) - see the 
light of day? This has become one of the burning issues in central European 
electricity deregulation ever since the first draft was published in April 
2000. Subject to perennial delays and uncertainties surrounding its 
implementation as well as criticism from generators and banks, SOK has become 
the laughing stock of Polish power reform. This is a pity for it holds the 
key to price and regulatory transparency, as well as the proper functioning 
of the Polish Power Exchange (Gielda Energii) as its head, Jan Buczkowski, 
never ceases to point out.

SOK's credibility has been dented by the decision of Elektrownia Belchatow, 
Poland's largest and most fuel-efficient generator and the linchpin to a 
competitive power market, to exclude itself from the first group of producers 
to be covered by the scheme. Belchatow, along with Elektrownia Opole and 
Elektrownia Jaworzno III, were to start dissolving their PPAs on 15 April. 
But Belchatow, afraid that if it joined SOK its financial condition would 
worsen considerably since it would be paying in to the system instead of 
receiving payments, is not renegotiating its PPA with state grid PSE. Unless 
the plant is able to rid itself of its punitive below-market contract, which 
relieves it of its low-cost advantage, the prospects for a competitive power 
market are dim.
Opole and Jaworzno hope for 1 July
In an article in the daily Puls Biznesu on 2 May, representatives from Opole, 
Jaworzno III and Elektrownia Dolna Odra (which has taken the place of 
Belchatow) are quoted as saying that they are optimistic that they will be 
able to start phasing out their long-term contracts on 1 July. But investors 
have heard it all before. SOK was supposed to be implemented in the 
second-half of last year, then in the first-half of this year, and now it's 
questionable whether the 1 July deadline is realistic. All this creates 
uncertainty. 
"This is what investors hate the most. What's more, it's extremely difficult 
to estimate the effects of SOK given that there isn't any historical 
precedent," Puls quotes Piotr Samojlik, general director of financial 
advisers CAIB in Warsaw, as saying. But even a botched SOK, many believe, is 
better than a dead SOK.
One of the stumbling blocks concerns the ministry of finance's reservations 
regarding the calculation of VAT in the payments. Apparently, this has yet to 
be addressed. But Puls quotes Jozef Pekala, the president of Opole, as saying 
that his plant and PSE have already reached a tentative agreement on the 
model of the annex to the PPA and are now awaiting the final text. All 
Opole's units are under a long-term contract set to expire in 2012 and worth 
an estimated ZL5bn. 
Jan Kurp, meanwhile, the high-powered president of Jaworzno III (who also 
doubles as head of the mammoth Poludniowy Koncern Energetyczny), is also 
upbeat and hopes to close negotiations by the end of this month. The 
following month will be devoted to talks with the banks, Kurp tells Puls. 
Jaworzno has a long-term contract set to expire in 2008 and a smaller 
contract (covering 12-15% of capacity) expiring in 2012.
Juchniewicz ready to free prices
On 10 May, Leszek Juchniewicz, the head of Poland's energy watchdog URE, 
confirmed he would stick to his July plans to exempt generators from the 
obligation to submit tariffs for approval despite the distinct likelihood of 
a continuation of the PPA regime. This is one of the few pieces of good news 
that has come out of the Polish power sector for some time and will be 
greeted positively by investors. In an address to parliamentarians, 
Juchniewicz said that while wholesale prices will be freed, retail prices 
will, for the time being, be capped in order to protect small and 
medium-sized consumers. 
SOK's fate, however, ultimately rests with the banks and the plants who, for 
a variety of reasons, are not particularly enthusiastic about the programme 
and have serious doubts whether the issue of stranded costs can be resolved 
in a fair manner. With parliamentary elections looming, it is vital that SOK 
be implemented as quickly as possible in order for there to be no 
backtracking and/or revisions after the elections.

Steve and Rick - In response to your question regarding the European 
allocation, here are responses on the Keeler and Worthen allocations.  These 
were the only two that Europe had required backup on when receiving the 
allocation.  Mike - By copy of this note, can you provide backup on the 
Europe allocation for your cost center, Henry's, and Marc's?  Thanks!

Elizabeth,
My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing 
services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the 
corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of 
acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility 
initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit 
allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management 
systems, and historical use.

Please let me know if any additional questions arise.

Thanks,
SW

Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time 
for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso 
and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 
towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and 
will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our 
current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global 
markets, including:

Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to 
commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and 
worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and 
identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects 
include:
Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation
Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter
Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset 
trading, environmental disclosure/labeling
Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, 
i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely 
with government affairs & public affairs units.     Maintain ongoing 
relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective 
coalitions with industry organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on 
behalf of Enron businesses.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.

The break up is imminent. And the Norwegian government is in the course of 
determining how its corresponding new offshore pipeline TPA regime will be 
structured. I have set up a meeting with Maria Foster, Steve Asplin and Rudi

for us.

Title: Broadening the Search for Opportunities: Status of Retail Markets in 
the European Union
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2330


INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF EUROPEAN RETAIL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOTRH 
AMERICAN PLAYERS
As the movement toward competition in North American retail markets remains 
uncertain, it is important to consider how opportunities may be evolving in 
Europe.

* European Union Directives will eventually make the electric and gas markets 
more integrated and open, creating a single market comparable to North 
America.

* Significant restructuring of assets and processes is mirroring US 
restructuring activity at the wholesale and retail levels, and in some areas 
moving faster.

* Currently, the only robust competitive retail gas and power market is in 
the United Kingdom, although other countries are technically open with some 
customer switching and still others are soon to follow.

After talking briefly this morning to Paul D and Doug, I suggest the 
following agenda for our discussion:
 1. Brown/ Sherriff announcement and accompanying "organisation chart"
  - mistakes 
  - other opinions (lack of consultation), optimising efficiency
  - geographic v. business v. functional division of responsibilities
  - business and functional reporting lines
  - further communication with other team members in London
 2. Practical day to day/ week to week matters
  - budget (review planned for early May)
  - existing and potential recruitment 
  - Kean weekly call participation 
  - Sherriff weekly meeting participation
  - London staff meetings
  - Enron Europe weekly report 
  - other intra-group and business communication needs
I have invited Jan to join the call, since the announcement did not call for 
him to report to any of those of us located in London/ Brussels/ Frankfurt.

first one has been drafted by EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders, 
which we are founding members of and where Peter is the Chairman of 
Electricity Working Group). The second has been prepared by the Electricity 
Association in the UK.

I am not trying to flog an issue or point, but in going through some recent, 
but still dated, e-mails, I saw this one from Professor Littlechild.  It 
gives you some sense of what he is trying to work on for us.  It does not 
really do justice to all that he can do and has done, but before I delete 
this, I wanted to pass it along.  I know Peter supposedly has this marked in 
his diary for cancellation on the day it comes due, and you may well decide 
that that is the appropriate course of action, but at least wanted to pass 
this along, because I think any decision to cancel needs your objective 
evaluation, something I think is lacking in Peter's judgment (how you can 
decide to cancel without having seen the man's work, plus I do not think 
Peter appreciates/understands the value, nor the nuances, of the argument 
that you need a contracts market and retail competition, otherwise he would 
support this work, since it bears directly on the Acceleration Directives 
that he is supposed to be pushing in Brussels!).  Hope all is going well.  
See you at the PRC if not sooner.   mcs

Dear Mark
 
We had a brief but helpful meeting on 7 February,  since when I have 
discussed and signed a contract with Annette Patrick. I was  hoping to begin 
work before now, but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded  this. I thought 
it would be helpful to recap where we now are and what I have in  mind.
 
You summarised the three topics where further work  would be helpful to you as
1. What went wrong in California? (and why it  should not preclude further 
liberalisation in Europe)
2. The importance of accelerated EU directives,  including the importance of 
separation of functions.
3. The importance of retail marketing, including to  residential customers.
 
On the first topic, I have recently published a  paper in the Journal of 
Applied Corporate Finance, Winter 2001 edition (which  incidentally features 
Enron in a couple of the other articles). Copy attached.  Most of it is 
familiar stuff but there is a concluding section on California  which answers 
the What went wrong question. We could aim to bring this to a  wider 
audience, but there are lots of papers on this topic now, and the  situation 
changes almost daily, so it may be better to incorporate it into a  paper on 
Europe.
 
On the second topic, I accepted an invitation to  address an analysts' 
conference (UBS Warburg) this coming Monday, on the topic  of regulatory 
policy in Europe and where it is going. I knew nothing about the  topic at 
the time, but thought it would force me to learn.  Unfortunately  there has 
been little time to do this so far. The topic ties in with the work we  
discussed, and if acceptable to you I propose to spend the next couple of 
days  working on it under the contract, with a view not just to the 
presentation, but  to a  subsequent paper and publication. I should say that 
the conference  pays a fee, but only enough to cover travel and conference 
time and the  presentation itself, not any underlying research time. 
 
I see from press reports that there has been some  development or lack of it 
with respect to discussions on the EU directive.  I  hope to talk to Kyran on 
this and related topics, either today or tomorrow, and  maybe he has 
something that he can email me. Perhaps next week we can talk about  how to 
take this work forward, and where to aim at - either a journal like  PowerUK, 
or as a direct input into some EU process.
 
On the third topic, my ideas are embodied in the  paper on Joskow that you 
have seen.The question is how best to publicise and  apply these ideas - 
perhaps in a paper on Europe again? That is, to argue for  the importance of 
the directives in a particular respect, namely retail  competition, and to 
show how California failed to do this  adequately?
 
On now to European regulation.
Best wishes
Stephen

Title: The Battle of the Destination Clauses
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2378

EUROPEAN GAS REPORT-THE BATTLE OF THE DESTINATION CLAUSES
The next round in the long war over competition in European gas is being 
fought
on a new battleground-destination clauses that sit within (or alongside) many
long-term contracts for gas supply in Europe. The Directorate General for
Competition of the European Commission (DG COMP) recently said it has been
investigating several long-term take-or-pay contracts for over a year to make
sure that destination clauses fall in line with European Union (EU) 
competition
laws.

* The abolition of territorial restriction clauses would be a prelude to more
widespread renegotiation of long-term take-or-pay contracts and would bring
genuine competition in European gas markets.

* In parallel with the pressure from the competition authorities, new
commercial opportunities appear to be opening up, notably in the 
Mediterranean,
bringing further pressure to bear on the destination clauses.

Nailia and I have "trickled" materials and papers over to Maureen since late 
March, Rick. I have to admit I have not kept a record of everything. Let me 
know if you and Steve would like to have a teleconference in preparation for 
the conference. You heard me in the staff meeting yesterday calling for 
single/ double slides drawing "lessons" for Spain, Italy, NL and Germany. 
(Paul Dawson claims nothing in the California experience is relevant to the 
UK, but I just don't accept that, esp. given the wholesale price rises since 
NETA inception he referred to during that meeting!)

By copy I'm asking Nailia to pull together for you electronically the most 
relevant items (esp. EC paper on Calif., Eurelectric visit report/ slides and 
EFET posit. paper). 

Fiona may have a European media "California comments" clippings file (esp. re 
Ruhrgas sponsored "study visit"?!)

And Maureen: Could you make physical copies for Rick of the items you are 
holding on Steve's file for the speech?

I am sorry to have forgotten to copy you on this e-mail I sent to Steve. 
Besides, I have sent another article to Maureen this morning on the danger of 
Californian crisis repeating in Spain (see attached here as well)

Steve,

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

Rick

I understand from Ann that you are looking put some subscriptions in place 
for European publications to help you  keep abreast of what's going on over 
here.  I'm preparing a full list of all the English-speaking trade journals 
for your perusal, but in the meantime I thought I'd make a few suggestion of 
how we can help you with this task.

1.  In my view, some of the most accurate and insightful coverage comes from 
the FT Energy special publications unit.  They cover the whole of Europe 
through a number of different titles.  Enron Europe has an online group 
subscription to this series so I am arranging for you to receive a password 
so you can access this site.  Most of the publications come out twice a month.

2.  My group is responsible for media monitoring in Europe.   The material 
comes from a variety of sources and it is quite a challenge to process and 
distribute it effectively.   I suggest that we put you on the distribution 
list for all material that either specifically mentions Enron or that relates 
to regulatory matters in Europe.  

3.  We have a number of different PR companies working for us in our markets 
around Europe and they generally provide media monitoring as well but this is 
not normally translated into English unless there is something significant.  
I suggest that we include you in the circulation for those pieces.

 We also cover Japan, Australia and the Middle East from here.

Japan.   I guess Nick O'Day will send material to you direct.  We have a 
daily translation service of headlines and significant longer pieces from our 
PR agency in Tokyo.
Australia.  I will send you what we get, but things are fairly quiet there at 
present.  I know that Mark Schroeder was in dialogue with Paul Quilkey about 
the status of Government Affairs but I don't believe the issue was resolved.  
I would like to talk to you separately about this issue at some point, if you 
have a minute.
Middle East.  I am still trying to get on the circulation list for media 
coverage as we effect the transition from John Ambler's group.  I plan to 
talk to John about this when he surfaces from handling DPC issues next week.  
In my experience, the key publication for this area is MEED - the Middle East 
Energy Digest.

4.   I will send you a full list of English-speaking trades and highlight the 
ones which I think you will find most useful.   I believe quite a few of them 
are now available online.

Please let me know if I can help with anything else and perhaps we can get 
together for lunch on your next visit.

Jackie

Nailia and I are taking care of circulation of relevant material from Energy 
Council of Mon. and Tue. this week. She is also following the EU-Russia 
energy dialogue. 
Would either of you like to flip through the 135 page Competition Report and 
let others in the group know your conclusions (in less than one side A4!!)? 
By the way, you should meet each other, as soon as Brendan makes it to London 
or when Jan next comes to Brussels.

Dear Nailia,

Please find attached the first conclusions of the Energy Council which took
place yesterday. You will note that the Council intends to take a position
on the proposals for the opening of the energy internal market by the
Barcelone Council in spring 2002. We will contact several permanent
representations and the Presidency of the Council to ask about Member
States' positions on this issue.

Attached you will also find the agenda for the EU-Russia summit on 17 May.

I also include the 30th Annual Report on Competition Policy which deals with
the competition policy in general and by sectors, issued today by the
Commission. The report states that competition in the energy markets will be
introduced if the following  conditions are met:
* suppliers are free to compete for customers;
* customers are free to change suppliers;
* an effective, non-discriminatory and cost reflective TPA regime is
introduced and maintained.
The report also deals with the proposal for a new Regulation dealing with
articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, setting out the competition rules
applicable to restrictive agreements, decisions and concerted practices, and
abuses of dominant positions.

Would you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Regards,

Amaia

CONFIDENTIAL

On Friday the Office of the Rail Regulator initiated a further investigation 
stemming from our complaint about abuse of dominance by EWS Railways.  In 
addition our allegations of discrimination and refusing to deal, ORR are now 
also investigating EWS's locomotives contract with General Motors (under 
which we believe EWS receives a payment when GM sells locos to third-party 
rail freight operators).

ORR had been discussing jurisdiction with the Department of Justice in the US 
and with the EC, however, both have now declined jurisdiction. ORR is 
therefore taking the investigation forward via a request for information from 
EWS.  This is one of the clearest abuses outlined in our complaint and it is 
therefore very encouraging to see ORR take the matter forward.  Further 
details are set out in the attached fax below.

Paul

Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

I just came across this morning to some additional information from the 
regulator (CNE) regarding their motivations on its Arcos TPA ruling: 

1) Despite the current regulatory gaps, Enron's allegations were properly 
crafted, and made possible a way forward within the existing legal framework. 
The "two-sides commitment" idea suggested by Enron has been quite determinant 
because...

2) ... the resolution fundamentally aims at making sure that the power plant 
is actually built (Enron finally commits), but also that new gas 
infrastructures start being developed asap!! There is clearly an underlying 
energy policy issue here, and this reasoning fits with the tight timescales 
imposed by the CNE to ratify our interest and signing the TPA contract. The 
resolution is seen by the CNE as a catalyser to put in track gas expansions 
and power plant investments.

Note that the CNE (and the Ministry) are testing if Enron is "truly" 
committed to put the money and invest by placing us in a no-return point 
(mine).

Please, find below a full English translation of the CNE's ruling.


Of special interest, see sections III, VI, VII and IX of the GROUNDS FOR THE 
DECISION ADOPTED Chapter.

EDF Pursues Italy's Montedison; 
Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor  

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]Power giant Electricit,de France (EDF) has sent shock waves through 
Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise 
its stake in electric firm Montedison to 20 percent from about 6 percent. 
However, Romano Prodi, the European Union commissioner for competition, is 
considering an intervention in the battle between EDF, the French electricity 
monopoly, and the Italian government. The latter has passed an ad hoc law 
restricting EDF to 2 percent of the voting rights for Montedison, the Italian 
electricity supplier spun off by Enel.  

Analysis: Once again, the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the 
European power market, with EDF playing the staring role. For the last year 
or so, as the European Union (EU) has enacted electric competition across the 
Continent, France's EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in 
other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by 
foreign suppliers. Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through 
its ownership of London Electricity, the French power firm has wanted for 
some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy. However, the 
neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France 
reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market. 

As I have mentioned before in this column, France has been criticized by 
other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country. 
As a result, EDF (which controls approximately 90 percent of the French 
electric industry) may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad 
until it further opens its own market to competition. To date, France has 
only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the 
EU, and EDF has played a large role in this resistance. While other European 
countries such as Germany have opened 100 percent of their markets to 
competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third each 
of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008, respectively. 
Thus, although other companies such as Spain's Endesa have attempted to push 
through barriers to obtain entry into France, it is questionable when true 
competition will emerge in the country.  

Nevertheless, EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its 
holdings in Montedison, one of Italy's main electricity companies. Reports 
are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison. EDF recently said 
that its stake increased from 3.971 percent to 5.971 percent. However, other 
reports have indicated that EDF already controls about 20 percent of the 
capital assets of Montedison. Both increases in Montedison were made 
recently, which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market 
regulatory Consob. EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made 
strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the company's financial 
assets across Europe. However, at the same time, EDF has also indicated that 
any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading 
purposes. In other words, EDF wants to control the generating assets of 
Montedison for resale across Europe's wholesale market. Further, with a 
20-percent stake, EDF would become Montedison's largest shareholder and a 
major presence in Italy's power market even as France remains mostly closed.  

EDF's argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial 
diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian 
government. The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a 
strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many 
additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators. In fact, EDF has 
admitted that its strategy is to "make 50 percent of its turnover from 
activities abroad by the end of 2005, compared with 25 percent currently." 
Consequently, it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its 
home country for expansion opportunities, and these opportunities typically 
have been in distribution and generation assets. Moving forward, the company 
has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation 

For instance, last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for 
the regional U.K. electricity company Seeboard, which is owned by American 
Electric Power (NYSE: AEP). Serving about two million connected customers in 
England, Seeboard owns, operates and maintains an electricity network of over 
45,000 km (28,000 miles) of overhead lines and underground cables. An 
acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDF's overall expansion efforts in 
Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity, one of 12 regional 
electricity companies in England and Wales, which EDF bought from Entergy in 
1998. In addition, EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden (Graninge) and 
Germany (EnBW) and reportedly is Poland's largest electricity distributor. 
These acquisitions were made by EDF International, which is wholly owned by 
the French government, and thus subject to EU oversight. Perhaps due to EDF's 
size and presence in Europe, these previous acquisitions were allowed without 
a great deal of EU intervention. However, now that other countries have 
voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede, it is 
unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny.  

As noted, trading appears to be the next wave of EDF's expansion efforts. 
Toward this end, EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in 1999 to create an energy 
trading company called EDF Trading. The various companies that EDF has 
invested in across Europe support the company's efforts to both learn about 
new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens 
fully across the Continent.  

For its part, the Italian government has responded that it will block any 
increase of EDF's ownership of Montedison, based primarily on the argument 
that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France. 
Specifically, Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting 
rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison. Further outlining 
its position, the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the 
imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be 
sold by Enel, one of the country's main power firms. As Montedison will be 
one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel, the Italian 
government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and 
thus having access to additional power assets in Italy. For instance, Enel is 
planning to sell Elettrogen, a generation company that produces about 15 
percent of the production capacity in Italy. If EDF were to increase its 
stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen, 
then EDF, as a foreign entity, would gain a lock over the Italian power 
supply market.  

Italy's anti-EDF law is an interesting development, but it does not mark the 
first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent. Spain 
also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with 
regard to the French company's pursuit of Hidrocantabrico, Spain's fourth 
largest supplier. However, despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict 
any expansion of EDF, the laws, although they are already in place, may 
ultimately be deemed anti-competitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome, 
which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU. 
Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates anti-trust 
allegations in the United States, any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain 
and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles. 

EDF also remains interested in the Spanish's largest power utility Endesa, 
which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the 
French electricity market (through a 30-percent acquisition of French 
electricity generator Soci&eacutet,Nationale d&#39Electricit,et de 
Thermique). Endesa, which recently terminated an attempted merger with 
Iberdrola, Spain's second largest power firm, has been viewed as a takeover 
target for larger companies such as EDF. 

At last report, the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to 
intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on "how far 
control was being exercised." In other words, EU intervention will be based 
on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an 
increased stake in Montedison. The fact that France remains resistant to 
electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate, 
and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the 
governments of Italy and Spain.

RE:  Denmark Approves Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
DATE: May 30, 2001
______________________________________________________________________________
_________
Yesterday, the Danish Parliament passed a resolution approving the Kyoto 
Protocol, allowing Denmark to ratify the treaty jointly with other EU member 
states.  Denmark is the first EU member to take such strong government action 
related to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.  Currently, Romania is the 
only industrialized nation to have ratified the treaty.  
While Denmark's action is largely symbolic, it puts pressure on the U.S. and 
other EU members to keep the international negotiations on track and puts 
mild pressure on other EU members to approve the treaty in preparation for 
joint ratification.
Please see Dow Jones article below.
Background
The Bush Administration is currently reviewing U.S. climate change policy 
with the aim of releasing an alternative approach to the Kyoto Protocol in 
late June.  The international climate change negotiations are scheduled to 
resume in mid-July in Bonn, Germany, but could be postponed based on the 
substance of the U.S. plan or a lack of progress during informal Ministerial 
meetings in late June.  
EU Ministers have publicly endorsed a EU ratification strategy by 2002; 
however, U.S. opposition to the treaty could delay or shift this approach.
Environmental Strategies is providing input to the Bush Administration and 
Congress on cost-effective, market-based approaches to address climate change.
Remarks by Danish Energy Minister
Danish Energy Minister Svend Auken made these remarks about ratification:
"Denmark is sending a strong signal that we still support the Kyoto Protocol, 
affirming our active contribution to protecting the environment we live in."
"It is even more important in light of the American rejection," he continued, 
"for countries that support the Kyoto Protocol to show clearly that the Kyoto 
process is continuing." 
I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.
Please see the Dow Jones article and link to the Agence France-Presse story 
below  (in French).

Denmark Approves Ratification Of Kyoto Climate Treaty

05/30/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COPENHAGEN (AP)--The Danish parliament has approved the 1997 Kyoto
global warming treaty in a move the environment minister called a strong
signal to the U.S. administration that the ratification process will
continue despite rejection by President George W. Bush.

In an 88-9 vote late Tuesday, the parliament in Copenhagen gave its
go-ahead for European Union member Denmark to ratify the protocol when
all 15 E.U. members jointly will sign the document. No date for the
common ratification has been set.

"In light of the American government's rejection of the Kyoto agreement,
it's even more important that the countries that support it clearly
demonstrate that the Kyoto process continues," Environment Minister
Svend Auken said Wednesday by telephone.

The U.S. has been heavily criticized for its environmental policies
after Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty in March, saying the mandatory
pollution reductions would harm American economic interests and
promising to offer alternative measures.

In Kyoto, Japan, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2% by 2012 from 1990 levels.

Auken stressed the importance of maintaining a dialogue with the U.S. -
the world's biggest polluter - on environmental matters.

"The way forward is not to take a defensive position but to show
leadership," he said. "Without the E.U. it is difficult to imagine a
successful global climate policy that will really make a real difference
to the environment."

E.U. leaders have pledged to go forward with the ratification process
despite the U.S. rejection and say it's possible to get the necessary
approval from 55 countries.

World delegations will reconvene in Bonn, Germany, in July for another
attempt to draft details of the treaty.

Rick,

I have spoken with Jeff's office and he will be in Houston on May 30th.  At 
the moment he has an 8:30-9:30, 9:45 "E-Speak" appointment and a 3:00-4:00pm 
floor meeting.  Joannie also mentioned that PR is trying to schedule some 
interviews and May 30th is one of several days they are looking at.  Joannie 
will check with PR and get back with me later today as to a possible meeting 
time.

Subject: Visit of Lord Mayor Sir David Howard, Request to visit Enron Tra 
ding Floor at 3 PM Wed 30 May


Dear all -- Please accept my apologies, but I have clearly caused some 
confusion regarding the venue for the Mayor's visit to Enron.  The Mayor and  
his entourage will be visiting the US in May and therefore they are seeking 
to take a tour of our trading floor in the Houston office, not London.   

In terms of who the Mayor should meet with while he is in Houston, I feel we 
should ask a senior representative of the company to host him on a tour of 
the trading floor.  Also, if he is available and willing, perhaps we should 
see if Jeff Skilling could meet with the group for a few minutes?  FG

**************************************

FYI -- Please see the request below regarding a proposed visit to Enron's 
trading floor at the end of May by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, 
which has come in to Carrie Robert from the British Consulate in Houston.   I 
would see this particular request as warranting a high level of attention and 
would welcome your views on who would be the best host for the meeting/tour, 
before I respond to Carrie.

Many thanks,
Fiona

Hi Fiona - Below is information on another request to visit Enron.  Please 
let me know if this is high level enough and the benefit for Enron if we 
accomodate their request.

Thank so much for your assistance.

As discussed, please find attached a description of the NETA rules.  There is 
also a plethora of other documents going into the policy background etc on 
the regulator Ofgem's website at www.ofgem.gov.uk.  Daily statistics are also 
available at http://www.bmreports.com.

Rick - it would be good to chat further next week.  One of the things I'm 
particularly interested in is how they've addressed the issue of ancillary 
services in California and elsewhere in the States.  One of the clear 
problems emerging with NETA is half-hourly energy prices being driven by 
frequency response etc.

In the meantime, if you need anything further please let me know.

Regards,

Paul

Rick,

As requested in Peter's note regarding Steve's upcoming presentation at the 
Eurelectric Annual Meeting, I have pulled four articles from our German press 
archives on "California".   We only archive Enron mentions, so the file was 
limited to the four above, only.   The original articles were obviously in 
German, but what I have provided are simply our Agency's summary of the 
article's key points in English.

I hope this proves useful.  Please let me know if there is anything else we 
can provide.

Thanks,
Fiona

My skepticism remains - the story was generated as a result of the Minister 
getting steamed up about the lack of effective liberalisation in Europe and 
barriers to UK takeovers on the continent.  This is nothing new - the DTI 
have been whinging about this for years (since EDF first arrived) but 
experience has demonstrated that they have little scope to take action if 
there isn't a competition case.   Indeed the report itself recognises this:

"Senior government officials said yesterday: "We are looking at ways of 
holding up European forays into the UK market. It may not be possible but, at 
the very least, we would force Brussels to intervene and impose an 
investigation on competition grounds, holding up the process."

In the past it has been difficult to "force Brussels to intervene" if there 
is no competition case (and I don't think there's a great one here).  The 
only legal option would be to invoke the reciprocity provisions of the 
directive. However, given that part-loading of the interconnector is one of 
the reasons that prices have climbed under NETA, this would be a major own 
goal for the DTI.

We've also confirmed this with DTI officials following the Guardian report.  
The source was Dan Corry who is a "special adviser" - read spin doctor - to 
the Secretary of State.  Conclusion - it's all pre-election hot air from Hain.

Subject: Re: UK power sector takeovers  

My understanding is that this would be targetted at State-owned enterprises 
and/or those based in countries where market opening is < 100%. Political 
target is France. If State-owned, a provision could be based on the Spanish 
legislation invoked to block control of Hidrocantabrico by EdF through EnBW 
and by EdP. The responsible UK official in DTI thinks that legislation is 
invalid under EU treaty rules. Commission officials probably share the view. 
In any case such a provision would I think require UK parliamentary time to 
get through. The touting of the idea could be just a pre-election puff?

Solomon Bros reports:

E.ON / POWERGEN - The Guardian reports that the UK government is looking
into ways to block or hold up foreign takeovers of British energy companies.
Separately, E.ON says it now has a majority stake in Sydkraft.

Stephen Littlechild used to be the UK electricity regulator. Paul and I have 
inherited a consultancy agreement Mark Schroeder signed up with him two 
months ago. He is going to do an EU-wide power markets competition review for 
me to use up some contracted hours. He has sent me the attachments below in 
preparation for the briefings on that review. You may find the second and 
third items, both of which make some reference to California, of interest.

Dear Peter
?
Thank you for the helpful telephone conversation  just now. I am attaching as 
promised the two recent papers and the slides for my  recent UBSW talk.? Any 
comments on the latter would be particularly helpful  in drafting the 
European paper we discussed. I look forward to receiving the  internal papers 
you spoke of.
?
Monday afternoon on May 21 looks fine at present  and I will pencil it in 
while you explore meetings with others.
?
With best wishes
Stephen

I've attached a summary of recently proposed NETA modifications.  The BSC 
Panel has recommended the Authority reject Mod P9.  The other mods will be 
considered by the BSC Panel for the first time on May 31st, a meeting which 
Paul and I will attend.  Proposed mods normally then go through a 
consultation and assessment/reporting phase before a decision is made.

Enron has an opinion on three of the mods: P12 (oppose), P15 (support with 
modified timing) and P18 (support option 1).  Elexon recommends P15 and P18 
be treated as urgent, which means the consultation and decision process will 
progress very rapidly.

Regards
Nick
