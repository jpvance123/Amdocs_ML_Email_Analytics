Andy,

Stephanie Sever has contacted ICE and has requested forms.  We can expect them soon.  Kevin has already given me his list of who will get access to ICE.  Send me a list when you know who should get access.

Subject:	Oil Daily Article on EnronOnline

This is an article that appeared yesterday in Oil Daily based on an interview with Larry Gagliardi and one of Enron's PR guys. There is one major error in that it says that our physical WTI contract is 24/7 as opposed to the NYMEX swap.

As per our discussion today, I think it will be concluded that Reuters and NYMEX can do what they want, terminals or wallboard.  I am not sure if you want to talk to Whally first before you talk to Reuters.

If possible, I would give Whalley a day or two to talk to John and Lavo.

In the mean time, Mike can see, on an enterprise license for a year, how high they are willing to go.

Your thoughts?

I will also tell Philippe about this if you haven't already.

Also, Webb called me and I will see him tomorrow about planning around your departure.

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

Andy,

I note that Carl and Leonardo have been put into the Specialized Tech category. 

Do you know if this was intentional? At the last PRC, they were both on the commercial track and I don't think they have been advised of anything to the contrary.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am
here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back
to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills
would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to
start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family.
I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a
chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same
for you.

Andy

I like this plan.  Clearly it has organizational implications that will need to be addressed.  Specifically, as I understand it, DealBench goes away.  Most of the marketing folks can be directly deployed on marketing of EOL auctions, but we will have to find a home for some of the support staff.  Also, we will have to redeploy some of the IT staff.  Hopefully, we can find a way to do some of the integration/engineering effort of creating the EOL auctions engine in parallel with our other initiatives.  I'll begin discussing that with Mike when you give me the go-ahead.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Andy,

We pulled the log ... found the guy ... and told him to knock it off.  
Please let me know if there is a repeat performance.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Great. I have added to my calendar. I know things must be pretty hectic so
if you want to just keep business out of the conversation we can add the
wifes. Let me know.

Andy:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking "responsible" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.
 
Thanks,

Philippe, John Andrus tells me he has had some general discussions with you
in recent weeks.  John and I will be in Houston next week,
Wednesday-Thursday, and we would very much like to meet with you at your
convenience one those days to discuss some ideas we have to make it more
attractive for Caminus users to trade on Enron OnLine.  (We're not trying to
sell you anything !!)

If you could make some time available I think it would be worthwhile; hope
to hear back from you.

I can be reached most days in Manhattan at 212 515 3691.

In addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite, I want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on EnronOnline you get DealBench functionality.  I know this was explored once before but I want to explore the possibility that we have a single backbone with EnronOnline and customers have a single login to Enron's services, including auctions, data rooms, and deal rooms.

Your thoughts?

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

In school books we study exactly your example from the bank.

But in our case, we are studying the HDD contract that pays financially in MMBtu (gas). So the tick size of the transaction would be MMBtu/DD rather than $/DD.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

Andy,
     Here are some numbers.  For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols.  I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly  (though it does calculate it).  We don't have access to UBS's models.  We will be using our model.  They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products.
In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30).  

1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%.  VaR = $745
2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356
3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later
4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863
5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559
6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000
7). Same for Nov02/Mar03 Will provide later
8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02 Will provide later

Lets discuss these when you have a look at it.
Naveen

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

This is an article that appeared yesterday in Oil Daily based on an interview with Larry Gagliardi and one of Enron's PR guys. There is one major error in that it says that our physical WTI contract is 24/7 as opposed to the NYMEX swap.

     Hi.

Philippe, John Andrus tells me he has had some general discussions with you
in recent weeks.  John and I will be in Houston next week,
Wednesday-Thursday, and we would very much like to meet with you at your
convenience one those days to discuss some ideas we have to make it more
attractive for Caminus users to trade on Enron OnLine.  (We're not trying to
sell you anything !!)

If you could make some time available I think it would be worthwhile; hope
to hear back from you.

I can be reached most days in Manhattan at 212 515 3691.

                  <span class="mstorydesc">All in all, a pretty good day. The shorts must be getting frustrated. Even with a 40% run in the Nasdaq since mid-Sep, a lower-than-expected Consumer Confidence Report could not take a large bite out of the index. The market opened lower, then&nbsp;the Consumer Confidence report came in below expectations, sending the market lower.&nbsp;This&nbsp;report is a key gauge for consumer spending as we enter the&nbsp;important holiday shopping season. The&nbsp;number came in at 82.2, vs consensus of 86.5 and vs 85.5 in October --&nbsp;consistent with the weakening&nbsp;labor market.

John,

Thanks for the update. You're certainly hitting the pavement!

Let's get together regarding Koch and Tauber's confidentiality concerns. I think we should be able to give them some comfort in this regard.

Please advise Koch that they do not need to "make markets" on EnronOnline. Our proposal gives them the right, but not the obligation, to post prices and volumes on the bid and/or offer side of the products they choose within the list we agree on.

Dave

Andy & Dave

This is to update you on a few meetings I have had and update you on my activities.

Last week I met with:
Neste Petroelum - Their US Activities are not very applicable, but they are the Finnish National Oil Company and the trader I met with felt there may be some application with their physical European business.  They are a big producer of "clean" gasoline and diesel that goes into the EU.  He is going to supply an appropriate contact.

Martin Resources - This is a medium size private company and the result of this meeting beyond general market intelligence was a possible interest in showing one market for sulfuric acid, which is a market where they have a Gulf Coast franchise.  My contact who is one of the owners and he will revert after having interanl discussions

Enterprise - This meeting got postpones until this coming Friday due to a crisis they had.  I did spend a little time with Monty Wells (I think that was his names)  who is the SVP incharge of the NGL's.  I only presented the idea briefly for him tho think about.  My meeting on Friday is with Jim Teague, President & CEO of Enterprise NGL division.

Tauber - Tauber is a medium sized trading company with $1 Billion in Revenues.  they are active in Petrochemicals, NGL, Refined Products, and heavy oils.  There was an interest and Tauber is an active EOL user and fan.  My contact Scott Posednik runs the Petrochemical book and his biggest deal breaker was the security of the transaction information.  He indicated the 1% chance that one of the EOL people with access to their data could share that with the commercial groups is a concern.  He is going to discuss this with his colleagues and come back to us with their interest.  They do a lot of trading in physical Raffinates, Naphtha, etc.

Koch Hydrocarbons - This meeting was well timed as they are actively looking at their e-commerce startegy.  I met with Mark Dobbins SVP -Trading and Ron Baker who runs their Olephins and NGL books.  Their biggest hurdle is going to be getting comfortable making markets.  Another issue will how the credit matrix works.  It appears if they did something that they might need something a little more sophistacated than the basic offering.  One final issue will be the reps and warranties made by Enron contractually as to the sharing of information with our business groups and the security of the data.  They have apparently had an ordeal negotiating their master agreements to transact on EnronOnline and are warry of Enron's contracts.   They are going to have some internal discussions and revert next week.

Shell Us Trading (SUSCO) - I had a very good conversation with Steven Murray and he was supposed to get back with me early this week about setting up a meeting.  The boundries have been established that our interest would be in their making markets for Oil, Petrochemicals, NGLs and Chemicals only.  Gas and Power are currently out of bounds.  

This week
I am Vancouver today and tommorrow attending a Wood products conference and I will be in Las Vegas on Thursday.  After thoroughly reviewing the pulp and paper industry I think that the only sectors that would easily fit into this model will be the waste paper and lumber. I have had and will have discussion with other producers, but they are still hung up on branding and their products not being commodities ect.  I am Vancouver and have several meetings together with the Rob Scheuer with lumber producers about showing offers.  In Las Vegas, there is a conference where Ray Bowen is the keynote speaker and there are several potential counterparties attending , including Waste Management.  My intent is not to spend too much time on Pulp and Paper and these two trips will allow me to quickly determine who the possible prospects are.

Leave me a message at x36413 if you have any questions or comments

Subject: solution for hedging options that doesn't decrement swap volume

Hi Andy.  Here's my suggestion (actually it was yours):

Product 1	Fin Power Swap		
	Web Visible	
	Offered Qty: 50
	Qty Increment: 5
	Min Qty: 5 (or whatever you want to use as a minimum)
Product 2	Fin Power Swap 
	Ghost Product - not web visible
	Offered Qty: 200
	Qty Increment: 1
	Min Qty: 1
	Base Link to Product 1 with Bid = 0, Offer = 0, Offset to Last trade of 0 with reset qty of 200
	NOT Auto-hedged to Product 1
Product 3	Fin Power Option 
	Auto-hedged to Product 2.

Here's what will happen:

Suppose the option is traded and to hedge it requires a qty of 15.  The actual hedge will be against Product 2.  Product 2 offered qty will reduce to 185.  Since Product 2 is not auto-hedged to Product 1, there will be no impact on the main swap.  The prices for Product 2 will always be exactly those of Product 1 since the bid and offer are 0.  

Note: Eventually, the offered qty for Product 2 will reduce below the amount needed for hedging a particular trade (for instance, if every trade required a hedge qty of 15, then after 13 trades, your remaining qty would be 5).  This is not a problem.  The hedging model for options allows for not enough volume being available on the swap.  The next trade would simply get fully hedged and pop the qty back up to 200.  Since it has an offset to last trade of 0, the bid and offer prices would still be those of Product 1.

Also Note:  We will have to make sure the power IT guys are prepared to get essentially the same swap (Product 1 and Product 2) under two different product ids.

Does this make sense?

I am working with IT on the look and feel for Kiodex Lite reports on EnronOnline.  I think the reports should be named "Kiodex Reports" and branded with the Kiodex logo.  While EnronOnline is delivering the reports, I want our users to easily understand that EnronOnline is not processing the reports and any errors/issues would be Kiodex's responsibility.  Pls. let me know if you agree.

<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>We're going to make it through the winter - the <b>North American
Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment</b> on
Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should <b>meet or exceed</b>
estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer
look at the assessment on Wednesday.
<p>On Wednesday, <b>Interior Secretary Gale Norton</b> talks about the
upcoming <b>Lease Area 181 sale</b>.  Secretary Norton believes there's
still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the
lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on
December 5.
<p>The <b>FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday</b> in how it looks
at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on
major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau
on Wednesday from <b><i>Megawatt Daily</i> Editor Michael Lustig and
Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church</b>.  Lustig
joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at
<br>10:00 a.m. ET.
<p>ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's <b>FERC
ruling</b>.  On Wednesday, she'll bring us comments from Mirant, the
California Department of Water Resources and the California ISO.  And
during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, <b>Independent Energy Producers
Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan</b> will join us from the
West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.
<p><b>Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager
Leonard Spearman</b> is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday.
He'll talk about the <b>TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland
security</b> at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the
Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.
<p>The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for
<b>alternatives to MTBE</b>.  <b>Chris Paschall of Industry Information
Resources</b> will talk about the possibility of making <b>ethanol out
of wine vines</b> - potential good news for California.  Join us from
Houston on Wednesday.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Reminder - since the markets are closed, we'll be
<b>dark on Thursday and Friday</b>.
<p>Wrap Note: We're <b>adding some of the day's commodity settles</b> to
the Wrap.  Here you go!

Enron Establishes Future Market For Memory Chips 
By Bob Sechler 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

Jun. 7, 2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

AUSTIN, Texas -(Dow Jones)- Dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAM, have long been viewed as the pork bellies of the computer industry, commodities whose prices swing widely based on supply and demand. Enron Corp. (ENE) is taking the analogy a step further by enabling DRAM manufacturers and consumers, such as computer companies, to engage in the same price hedging strategies deployed in industries that depend on traditional commodities. 

The company has launched a lot program to buy and sell DRAM chips based on forward contracts, and it says an average of 25,000 standard 128-megabit DRAM chips a week were traded through its system during the first quarter, the initial quarter for active trading. That's a small amount relative to the overall worldwide DRAM market, estimated at $32 billion last year, but it is a start. 

"The (DRAM) chip market is a boom-or-bust cycle, with prices very high or very low," said Kenneth Wang, director of Enron's global semiconductor group. "It's the perfect market. And Enron has the credibility." 

Enron, Houston, is no stranger to making markets. The company, once a stodgy natural gas pipeline operator, has evolved into a major commodity marketer and trader, dealing in everything from energy products to chemicals and Internet bandwidth capacity. 

Chip industry players and observers are intrigued by the DRAM effort, although many remain skeptical. Most point out that the potential for a DRAM futures market has been discussed for years with little to show for it. 

"All of the PC companies I know of would love to have an effective hedge" against DRAM price swings, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Dan Niles said. 

Every computer contains at least one of the chips, and many contain multiple chips, making DRAM chips among the top component expenses for computer makers. Other products, such as automobiles and digital cameras, use the memory chips as well. 

At present, DRAM chips are sold through direct contracts with manufacturers, such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Samsung Electronics Co. (Q.SSE), and through a spot market, where the price fluctuates daily. There is no independent exchange for DRAM futures that would allow manufacturers of the chips or their consumers to hedge against unexpected price swings. 

Challenges to forward trading in DRAM have proved daunting. DRAM isn't quite uniform, although it's considered the closest thing to a commodity in the computer industry. Many different configurations of the same basic chip exist, depending on the needs of the customer. 

DRAM prices have fallen over time - about 30% a year over the last 25 years as manufacturing costs have declined - despite short-term fluctuations. 

Memory chip prices have fallen steeply this year because of weak computer demand. Standard 128-megabit chips have been selling recently for about $2.40 on the spot market, off almost 50% since February. 

Technical innovation always has the potential to render existing DRAM varieties obsolete, which would open the door to additional risk for the holder of a forward buy contract. 

Nonetheless, some major industry players are watching Enron's effort closely. 

Officials at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), a leading consumer of DRAM chips, think the effort has merit and could work. Compaq hasn't made any DRAM purchases through Enron yet but remains receptive to the idea. 

The trend of falling DRAM prices "happens on a macro level, but there have been years when the price has increased 50% or 100%, and it happens in a very quick period of time," said Jack Baikie, Compaq's vice president of corporate procurement. "It's not a predictable cost curve" in the short-term. 

This year's declining prices likely would reverse quickly upon some signal that PC demand was rebounding, he said. A forward trading market "could provide us the ability to anticipate market trends and do some no-risk, or minimal-risk, hedging," Baikie said. 

Baikie dismisses the notion that DRAM isn't a commodity. "A memory chip is a memory chip," he said, with the only difference being how an individual consumer elects to configure and use it. 

Micron, one of the top DRAM manufacturers, also is receptive to the idea of a forward trading market. But Micron spokesman Kipp Bedard cautioned that the technical variations of DRAM, combined with continuing innovation, aren't insignificant issues and have proved to be a problem in past efforts. 

Enron is confident it has the expertise to package and make standard its forward contracts for DRAM in a way that renders the technical differences surmountable. Company officials point to Enron's pioneering effort in Internet bandwidth trading as an example of a market that also faced technical hurdles. 

But Enron officials acknowledge they're still demonstrating that their effort is viable and valuable. 

"We want people to first get used to it," said Wang, of Enron. "It's a process of education." He said he expects trading volume to increase when big companies use the market. 

Enron executives said that DRAM is the first of their efforts to establish forward markets for all types of computer components. Eventually, Enron plans to trade forward contracts for components such as liquid-crystal displays. 

"We'd like to hedge maybe 60% of a computer, if possible, in the long-term," Wang said. "That's our plan."

Hi Andy,

Thank you for briefly meeting with me on November 15th to discuss the
questions we were looking for on the Swaps topic  for Crack Spread, BTU and
Spark Spread.

Per our conversation, you stated that you wanted to go away to work on
these practice questions for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread.  As you
know, we were hoping to receive some of your questions this week.  Do you
have any idea when you will be able to send them to us or meet with us to
help drive these questions out.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,

One of our Arkansas pilots died this week He had signed up in August of 2001 but had not flown a mission for us yet. Details on the memorial forthcoming. Below is correspondence regarding the crash. Be careful out there.

Beth, 

 According to news reports this morning Dr. Jim Arnold and his wife were
killed yesterday in the crash of their Cessna Conquest near Arkansas
City, KS, leaving two boys ages 5 and 7.
That will also effectively remove Stan Sence from the pilot list as he
flew Dr. Arnold's other airplane.

Don

Beth --
   Following is the FAA preliminary accident report on Dr. Arnold's 
crash. The report says he told air traffic control he had lost his 
autopilot. The loss of an autopilot alone surely would not have 
caused him a serious problem. It sounds to me like he experienced a 
failure of his attitude indicator and/or his directional gyro -- 
possibly his entire vacuum system, but that latter suspicion is just 
speculation on my part.
   The report suggests he had been assigned a block altitude between 
27,000 and 28,000 feet on an IFR flight plan enroute to Rifle, 
Colorado from Springdale. The weather at the nearest reporting 
station at 1:45 p.m. CST indicated freezing rain was falling beneath 
a 1300-foot overcast. Radar contact was lost 70 nautical miles 
southeast of Wichita at 2:10 p.m. CST.

Greg --

I just spoke with Bill Popp.  Major points are:

Sungard is impressed and wants to continue to move on the Offline opportunity.

Jim Ashton, CEO of the Trading and Risk Systems Group, would like to meet us.  He is in London now where he must stay until after Sungard's quarter end.  We can either meet with him now in London or wait until July when he travels to the U.S.

Sungard wants to do the deal for all markets, but would consider, if necessary, a deal where they have rights only in the Energy and Capital Markets.

Sungard will need help defining the market opportunity.  As we move forward, if we would allow it, they would like to talk jointly with a couple prospects, under NDA, to help guage interest and understand the commercial spiel.

The question for us is how aggressively do we want to move with Sungard given their royalties-only deal requirement.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.

-- Rex

Bill --

Thanks to you and the Sungard team for your time in Houston last Friday.  The EnronOnline opportunity appears to be a good fit with a number of Sungard's strengths.  I have spent some time debriefing the people on the Enron side, and we believe that it makes sense to continue to pursue our discussions.

We discussed the need for Enron Net Works to get to know Sungard's executive team and to better understand your technical and marketing approach.  I believe the best next step would be a meeting between the appropriate Sungard and Enron executives.  We are a flexible on the location.  Just let me know what date and place works best for the Sungard team.

Your team also expressed interest in learning more about other Enron systems efforts, including DealBench and mid/back office systems.  Let me know if you would like to set up separate meetings to focus on those areas.  

Thanks again for your interest.  We look forward to further discussions.  Best regards.

-- Rex

I think this warrants some investigation

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these "custom" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these "custom" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

Torrey

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Hi Andy -

Very good to hear from you --

As of the 1st of the month, I am now working for Allegheny in New York, with
Barry Kostiner and Jake Goldberg (not the fitness guru of the same name).  I
called you at home but got your answering machine - send me your work number
to this address and I'll call you sometime during the day tomorrow if that's
convenient.

Alex

Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.

Hope all is well.

Dave:

As you and I discussed, Jake and I are focusing on quickly contacting the key U.S. banks in the FX space to assess their interest in posting foreign exchange products on EnronOnline, similar to your earlier recent work with several Canadian banks.  The attached list describes the key US-based FX prospects we'll be contacting during the next several days.

We also will be contacting other financial institutions regarding other products, such as interest rate swaps, corporate bond trading, and other ideas.  However, I wanted to quickly get the FX groups of these banks up to speed in order to parallel the progress on the Canadian banks.

Please let me know if you have comments or questions.

Thanks,

Mike

Mike

This is to give you and Dave an update on what I am working on.

In essence, I am focusing all my efforts at this point on FX and leveraging from the work that Dave and his team have done.

My methodology is to contact the "Top FX Banks" prepared by Dave which he has not already contacted.

So with that in mind the focus in now on the following:

Deutsche Bank
HSBC
Bank of America
Warburg Dillion Read, 
Credit Suisse First Bost
Merill Lynch

The Scoop

You name the sector and it's probably down. The market has been on the defensive since the opening bell. A number of downgrades, talk of SEC investigations, accounting concerns weighed on the market today. The WSJ highlighted concerns in both Tyco (TYC 29.90 -5.73) and Amazon (AMZN 12.53 -1.20). Enterasys (ETS 4.20 -6.60, -61%) announced a review of Asia/Pacific revenue recognition and said the SEC is investigating; Elan (ELN -50%) is a recent accounting worry and considerably lowered EPS estimates.The semi equipment sector was lower, but did better than most tech sectors.

I know flying into Aruba's airport, which is exposed to high winds,  the pilots sometimes line up like that and correct last minute. But this guy looked like a drunk driver. So happy I was not on that plane.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Rika,

 Davis-Besse will probably be using Framatome to perform the repair work on the head crack.  You will probably see wire reports that Framatome expects to be complete with the repair in about 60 days.  We, however, totally disagree with that assessment.  Framatome may be estimating based on total amount of work they have to do, but they are not incorporating any delays for regulatory review and approval.  I believe our July restart forecast is much more realistic.
 
 
Thanks,
Dan

ChemConnect and Envera will offer their Members unmatched, online global buying and selling opportunities, supported by end-to-end connectivity and collaboration--including sales, logistics, and financial services--across entire supply chains. With each company's proven B2B expertise in creating new efficiencies and improved bottom-lines for their members, the two companies together represent the first fully-integrated, full-service e-commerce solution, where buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics can meet in an open, independent marketplace to find new business partners, negotiate purchases and sales, and complete order fulfillment through automated back-office business processes and system-to-system integration. Because both companies' solutions are "ready-now," with low entry costs, chemicals and plastics buyers and sellers can immediately, and profitably, benefit from procurement, sales, and supply chain efficiencies.  

The companies will also continue their commitment to the Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) and the development of Chem eStandards(TM), the standards for the transfer of XML documents between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which enable global collaboration among many partners. Transactional efficiencies and cost optimization results as companies connect to trading partners through the World Chemical Exchange or through the Envera Network.  

"We have the solutions, the dedication, the experience, and the expertise to help our Members--and all those who will become our Members--to increase their sales and procurement efficiencies, from the start of the online negotiating processes to final product delivery," said Bob Mooney, Envera CEO and newly appointed member of ChemConnect's Board of Directors. "This is now the only virtual one-stop solution for all buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics in companies of all sizes, around the world."

E-Trading 'Veteran' EnronOnline Calmly Faces NewcomersEntering Market
and United ICE-IPE.

06/07/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

In the world of energy e-trade, Enron is one of the veteran players, having
launched its EnronOnline commodity trading platform in November 1999 - and
having completed its one-millionth transaction on the trading system late last
month.

Trading activity on EnronOnline is driven in large part by the Houston-based
company's strength in the North American natural gas and power markets. But
Enron wants the market to know the company is much more than a gas, power, and
now bandwidth trader.
Last week, Enron added crude oil and refined product options to EnronOnline,
to go alongside the existing 52 products the company currently lists in the US
oil market. Larry Gagliardi, director of US crude and products trading for
Enron, says that new contracts are constantly being considered, based mostly
on recommendations from users of its trading platform.

In the US, Enron lists several types of primarily financial crude contracts on
EnronOnline. These include swaps that replicate New York Mercantile Exchange
futures contracts, jet differential swaps, and gasoline crack spreads. Enron
also has a physical West Texas Intermediate contract that is traded
around-the-clock.

The company posts a bid price and offer price for all of those contracts,
which means 104 US crude and product contracts are available on EnronOnline.
In US markets, about 5 million-6 million barrels of firm oil quotes are posted
daily on EnronOnline. The company electronically lists oil contracts through
2002, but the system can accommodate longer-term deals.

Outside the US, Gagliardi says that EnronOnline has been most successful in
European crude markets. "Asia has been a little harder, technologically," he
says, noting that computer technology and internet connections are less
reliable there.

Enron's offerings in Europe include a swap for the differential between dated
Brent quotes and the front-month Brent futures contract on London's
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), and swaps that mimic the IPE's Brent
and gas oil futures contracts. A range of contracts are offered in Asia,
including straightforward swaps for the Dubai and Tapis crude benchmarks, as
well as for regional gas oil, high-sulfur fuel oil, and kerosene.

When EnronOnline first launched, Gagliardi says, many brokers thought Enron
was committing suicide by posting hundreds of commodity prices online. But the
gamble has paid off. Enron's North American gas and power trading volumes, for
example, have exploded to nearly twice the size of volumes handled by its
nearest competitor, thanks to EnronOnline. Last year, Enron traders used the
trading platform to complete more than 3,000 trades per person, up from 672
per trader in 1999.

In recent months, Enron's trading activities have been overshadowed by other
developments - most notably the oil company-backed IntercontinentalExchange's
planned acquisition of the IPE.

Intercontinental, or ICE, is also making a push in Asian oil markets, having
just opened an office in Singapore. Far East derivatives offered on ICE
include Singapore gas oil, fuel oil, kerosene, and naphtha oil product swaps.
ICE also offers Dubai and Tapis crude oil swaps.

Despite being faced with new competition, Enron's Gagliardi says the company's
strategy hasn't changed. He bets that the liquidity and prices on EnronOnline
will go unmatched by others.

Enron's online trading system is different from most of its rivals. ICE, gas
and power exchange TradeSpark, and others bring together buyers and sellers to
trade anonymously online. On EnronOnline, Enron is a counterparty to every
deal done on its site.

Some traders have criticized Enron's trading platform, saying they prefer
doing deals on exchanges with hundreds of participants - not on an online
platform that they say is a sales channel for Enron.

Gagliardi admits that the exchange model sounds appealing, but says that, so
far, those exchanges have been unable to offer the same trading opportunities
available on EnronOnline.

"The reality of the situation is that no one wants to put out a number and
leave it firm," he says of other online commodity exchanges.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Some of the star witnesses in the Enron collapse will appear Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The question remains: Will they have anything to say? The witness list includes former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Fastow is expected to invoke his constitutional privilege not to speak, but Skilling has indicated he'll talk. We'll have live reports covering the hearing from our Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge is expected to speak in front of the National Press Club on Thursday. We'll bring you all the details on Ridge's speech from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Tomorrow in Houston, the Ziff Energy Group is hosting the North American Gas Storage Conference. Plans for hundreds of new gas-fired power plants have been cancelled recently, resulting in record levels of gas in storage. The Houston bureau will bring us coverage of the Conference and we'll hear how company executives are dealing with too much gas in storage. 

Also from Houston on Thursday, Petrobras President Renato Bertani talks about problems his company is having with the development of offshore reserves in Brazil. He says Brazil doesn't have access to developing technologies that allow for deep-water exploration. 

Shell WindEnergy is acquiring the Llano Estacado Wind Ranch located near White Deer, Texas. During the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Industrial Information Resources Production Industry Power Manager Britt Burt will join us in Houston to discuss the acquisition of Shell's second wind farm. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more from California Senator Joe Dunn, Chair of the Senate Committee investigating price manipulation in the state's wholesale energy market, regarding Enron's refusal to comply with a subpoena to attend a deposition Wednesday. Dunn will discuss the committee's next steps on Thursday. 

Also on Thursday, Raymond James & Associates Analyst Jon Cartwright will speak with Kym from St. Petersburg, Florida. At 3:00 p.m. ET, he'll discuss Calpine and the market reaction to news of an SEC request for information concerning selective disclosure. 

Closing Prices for Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2002	
 	 Crude:	 $19.78/bbl	 -$0.29	
 	 Unleaded:	 $0.5710/gallon	 -$0.0142	
 	 Heating Oil:	 $0.5279/gallon	 -$0.0090	
 	 Gas:	 $2.101/mmBtu	 +$0.027	
 	 Fwd uE(Mar.):	 $3.55/mmBtu	 unchanged	

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Jay,

It was good to meet you today. As per our conversation in the hallway, Andy Zipper and I would like to get the "Vega Limit" for power options decimalized. Currently we can only take this value down to 1. We would like to have the ability to set this at .1 (point one). Thanks.

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

Andy,
 
Attached is the contract draft for NGPL, which I have forwarded to Dave Devine.
 
The contract was originally drafted by Mark Taylor and has been revised by Travis. 
 
I have also reviewed it.
 
Please let me know if you wish to make any comments on it. I informed Dave that the draft I sent him was still subject to internal "departmental approval" - so we can still make changes, if any are necessary (and I can't imagine they will not have any comments!)
 
Dave

Kenny -

I picked up your voice mail. Apologies if this is not timely as I've been
out this week.  So, you may have already gotten this same info and update
from Mike, but here goes.

I understand that you are really wanting a push to get this deal done asap.

Mike and I feel the same way as we still are very supportive of the deal
and recognize the impact on momentum that extended contract negotiations
can have.

I would like to manage your expectations on the timing, though.  As you
know, we visited with Enron legal for the first time on Monday, May 21.  At
the end of the meeting, Enron took the to-do to cycle edits based on our
commercial and business principle discussions.

We received the revised contract on Monday, June 4.  Realistically
speaking, the contract has been rewritten. We are hopeful that the business
and commercial terms that have been agreed upon are still in tact, but
regardless, the new document will take us some time to digest, reflect, and
comment.

Mike, Mark, and Brian are reviewing the contract in detail today and
tomorrow.  You and I should expect to receive their summary comments and
feedback early next week.

When I have gotten them, I will call to schedule review time with you as
well.

Thanks,

Peggy

Peggy,
I ran into Andy this morning at Enron.  He told that we had the contract
and I said I would expect to review/discuss the changes as soon as Mike and
team had assessed it.  I didn't get the sense that it was a rewrite, but if
that's the case, so be it.  I need you to give me a date as I am travelling
all next week.  I don't want this to drag on.  I feel like we are losing
steam here and I know Bibi wants to close the deal by end of quarter (which
I guess is June)......Andy, what are y'alls expectations for getting this
wrapped up?

Andy,
UBS has given us a list of open due diligence items made by UBS' Market Risk Group.  We would like to have due diligence completed by this evening so that we might sign soon thereafter.

Below are the items for which you were identified as NetCo contact.  Please let me know the status of this information and send it to me as soon as possible.  If you need any assistance from me, do not hesitate to call.


3) Detailed explanation of funding assumptions which would include what 
levels the traders expected to receive funding from Treasury and how Treasury 
derived both overnight and term internal lending rates. - Andy Zipper

4) A detailed description of how volatility curves are currently being built. 
 Description should include what inputs are used, are outputs consistent with 
inputs, and are these curves independently verified by a internal control 
group. - Andy Zipper

Scott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.

My comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.

Can you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?

Thanks.

------------------
Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.

We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.

As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  

The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.

My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.

Solutions:
Create a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.
Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.
Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.
Rethink EJBs.

If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.

Andy,

I see two ways to do cross-commodity trading that would add value:

The first one is to do proprietary trading, trying to find opportunities among markets. Prices in one market may not reflect the proper relationship with other market.
Develop products for our customers that manage their total risk. But, in real life, many times the risk of a client is a risk of combination of different commodities that have their prices depending on one another. The solution for this problem would be a desk within Enron to trade dynamically positions with the other desks, replicating this risk.

Note that the second will depend on the first.

In terms of weather, we have been developing products that address the volume risk of commodities. Normally people are exposed to the product volume*price. So, we have been thinking solutions for volume risk with variable prices (what we call quantos). The solution of this product requires dynamic trading of the commodity and the weather as well. These products are close to my second bullet point.

Your example is what we call the gas product with a second trigger in weather. They are possible and very important for the market at this point. The good thing about this one is that the easiest way to achieve it will be implementing the first bullet point, the second bullet point comes as consequence.

Feel free to ask us questions about the weather piece and its interaction with commodities. If we do not know, it will be very interesting to research the answers.

Thanks,

Claudio

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy

Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

We embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow us to focus development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  However, due to what we believe to be inherent deficiencies in the J2EE specification, we have gradually reduced our use of these technologies.  In fact, EnronOnline's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  

The problem areas are performance and enterprise integration.  Specifically, the specification does not allow for sufficient tuning.  The result is that many of the "features" cause significant performance penalties, even when those features are not relevant to the application at hand.  Additionally, as B2B markets evolve, there is a greater need for integration between multiple platforms.  This need is not addressed at all.

It is our perception that the J2EE specification is influenced too heavily by vendor input.  We believe that large end-user customers should have an equal voice in the evolution of the specification.  Such input would be particularly valuable since vendor competition issues would not taint it.  We would welcome an opportunity to participate in such a committee.

Hi Lydia,

Just to keep you in the loop, apparently Andy will not be in London for this meeting we spoke about yesterday.  We will however, be including him via video conference.  Due to the time difference we have moved the meeting till 5pm (London time) on the 8th June to accommodate Andy's participation.  Would you be able to book a VC room for him please, and advise which room he will be situated in.  The meeting will be 2 hours maximum in duration.

Many thanks
Suzanne

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.
<p>In Washington, we'll continue to examine the major energy issues
expected to arise during the New Year.  We'll take a look at <b>what
Congress will do with comprehensive energy and electricity
legislation</b>.  Our Washington bureau will also follow the <b>FERC</b>
and its <b>push for regional transmission organizations and wholesale
competition</b>.   These are some of the issues we'll look at as 2002
begins.
<p>On Wednesday, energy consultant and <b>former Assistant Secretary of
Energy during the Clinton Administration Robert Gee</b> will join us in
the Washington bureau.  He'll give us his take on the <b>U.S.
relationship with OPEC</b> and we'll get his assessment on the <b>start
of retail competition in Texas</b>.  Gee will join us during the noon ET
newscast on Wednesday.
<p><b>The big switch is coming to Houston</b> - On Wednesday we'll bring
you a report on <b>deregulation starting in Texas on January 1</b>.  The
Houston bureau will have details on how the power grid reacted to the
switch, and get an update from retail electricity providers.  
<p>Also from Houston, <b>John S. Herold, Inc. CEO Arthur Smith</b> says
upcoming <b>earnings releases may hold some unwanted surprises</b>.
He'll join us from Houston on Wednesday to <b>discuss his company's
research report and what we can look forward to in 2002</b>.  Catch
these reports from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

With time running out before Congress finishes business for the year, ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is making a new attempt to pass energy legislation. On Tuesday, the Washington bureau will cover a news conference on Murkowski's plans to announce his new approach to move an energy bill this year. 

Also from Washington on Tuesday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is the guest speaker at Energy Daily's newsmaker breakfast. Abraham is expected to talk about the status of energy legislation in Congress. The Washington bureau will bring us coverage of the Abraham speech tomorrow. 

The Houston bureau will speak with Raymond James & Associates E&P Energy Team Vice President John Gerdes. Earnings for some companies are down compared to the third quarter last year, but Gerdes says production volumes seem to be in line with expectations. He'll discuss the third quarter during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday. 

PG&E and the California Natural Gas Producers Association are 
co-hosting an informational workshop on Northern California natural gas issues. ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us an update on the workshop on Tuesday. Kym says the meeting will cover a number of topics including discussion of new proposed well connection protocols, a review of the proposed gathering line auction process and a review and discussion on PG&E's proposed plan of reorganization. We'll have all the details on the workshop from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday. 

Goldman Sachs Chairman of the Global Power Group 
Doug Kimmelman will speak with Kelsey Hubbard on Tuesday from 
New York. Kimmelman will discuss the state of the merchant energy business and what the recent economic slowdown will mean for current power projects. Log on during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast to catch Kimmelman. 

Finally from Boulder on Tuesday, E Source Director of Strategic & Marketing Issues John Egan will join us during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. He'll discuss the E Source teleconference titled, "Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market." 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

They see it anyway, why worry.  Its a speed issue and I don't think they will keep up with him - I think he doesn't fully see his interaction with NYMEX sometimes.

Great news on TrueQuote and Brokerclient.

Good luck with Frank.

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well 

Andy

Mike

I attach a letter of intent which I hope covers all the points we discussed this morning. On the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone. If you wanted something more informal let me know.

Paul - let me know if you have any comments.

Scott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.

My comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.

Can you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?

Thanks.

------------------
Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.

We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.

As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  

The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.

My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.

Solutions:
Create a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.
Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.
Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.
Rethink EJBs.

If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

  Following up from this afternoon's meeting, attached is a Word document that describes the specific mechanics for the tax refund that all will be receiving this year (as well as a description of why it is being made - it's a consequence of the tax rate reduction).  Also attached is a pdf file that sets forth the tax rate reduction schedule for the next 7 years - for several taxes in addition to the Federal Income tax (such as the Estate tax and AMT).  You can call me at x30938 with any questions.  SHD.

Regards,
Sherri

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( <http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html>), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Andy,

Mark Tawney told me that you are setting up a cross-commodity desk.

I think it very interesting. Could you give me more details?

Depending on exactly you have in mind, we may be able to help you using weather products.

Richard, Derrick and Alan:

I think we can all agree that Thursday's conference call was very constructive and promising.  In order to ensure that we work together in the most efficient and effective manner, let us make sure that our communication channels among the four groups (Enron Net Works, Enron Global Markets, GM IS&S and GM Worldwide Purchasing) is always inclusive.  I suggest the following contacts on all correspondence: 

ENW - John Allario (713-853-4587) 
EGM - Alan Engberg (713-853-5279)
IS&S - Mike Darrow  (313-665-5206)
WWP- Derrick Starosa (810-575-2221)

EGM and ENW have begun putting together the product and market description for each of the products specified at today's conference call.  John and Alan are coordinating that effort along with Enron's Fundamentals Group.  My understanding is WWP will likewise be ready to discuss its operational and product issues during the upcoming meeting in Detroit, tentatively scheduled for the week of June 11th.

The EGM/ ENW teams will provide a well researched product and market opinion of those petrochemicals initially deemed lacking sufficient market traction as well as those petrochemicals specified by WWP as potential Pilot Program participants.  Those potential Pilot Petchems were identified as: (1) Benzene, (2) Butadiene, (3) Cumene, (4) Ethylene, (5) Methanol, (6) PG Propylene, (7) Styrene, (8)Toluene.  Let's plan to determine the best day(s) to meet in Detroit by next Wednesday, June 6th.

Please advise me of any questions you may have or of any errors or omissions, which this email may contain.   I look forward to working together will all of you on this effort over the next two weeks.

Best regards,

-John

Andy,
     Here are some numbers.  For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols.  I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly  (though it does calculate it).  We don't have access to UBS's models.  We will be using our model.  They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products.
In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30).  

1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%.  VaR = $745
2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356
3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later
4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863
5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559
6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000
7). Same for Nov02/Mar03 Will provide later
8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02 Will provide later

Lets discuss these when you have a look at it.
Naveen

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

I don't know if Bob hillier talked to you yet, but I need Stack and Option manager set up on a stand alone machine. I am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow.

My cell is 713 419 0203. Call with questions.

Where: Livonia, MI (Detroit Area)
Who: Craig Fishbeck (President, Vector), John Donaldson (V.P. Marketing), Amy Bruhn (Manager, Marketing)
Comments: NGPL's presence in the Chicago Area should help; J. Donaldson has stated that Vector on EnronOnline could replace the need for them to hire a marketer; EnronOnline trades on several liquid points that Vector crosses; Vector needs an online presence

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Thanks,
Paul

Andy,

Just finished meeting with Nelson from gas fundies and Martin Lim from power fundies to discuss getting the Exotica libraries migrated ASAP. The best I can get from them is "hopefully tomorrow" as far as a date for migration. They are dealing with the validation of calculation routines between the UBS libraries and the Exotica libraries since Exotica will play a role in pnl calculation. I will follow up on this again tomorrow. I told them that "hopefully tomorrow" was not the answer I was looking for so I would help out in any way. They recognize that we need these libraries loaded on our machines regardless of their validation. Also, Nelson showed me a list of the products that are scheduled for 'day 1' and power options are not on that list. There are a lot of people working with that list to prioritize support so this is just a heads up for you. Later.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

GP

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Can you meet with me before you head back to London?  I am on 27.

I am not sure exactly what happened today but it sounds like a shutdown but you want to stay with EGM and sell things we have geared up at Net Works to sell as well?

I am at 713-853-6635.

In short, the version of StackManagerServer you are using will no longer work after our next release.  The version you working with is about 9 months old.  There has been significant modifications to the interface, event model, and message types.  

Your version of SMServer cannot be used any longer.  We are still in the process of finishing development.  After we have completed it, we may be able to provide some assistance.  However, there will be little time for you to make modifications prior to our release.

Regards,
Michael

Andy,

This technically possible if we model this as a standard product.  To make it look like a realtime auction is also possible but will require some work.  It's something that would be interesting to have.

All,

Dale Neuner and Ross Mesquita referred me to you all.  I work with Global Strategic Sourcing and am looking to implement an "online marketplace" idea into Enron Online.  This would involve vendors and suppliers providing bids in a structured format - kind of like a reverse auction E-Bay.  Vendors would be able to see their competitors bids online, but not their names.  Any registered vendor would be able to update their numbers online, "real time".

First, we would like to know if anything like this is being done at Enron.  
Next, is it technologically possible to bring this concept into Enron Online?

Please advise.  We would like to do a test pilot as soon as possible with Crane Rentals.  Please give me a call so we can discuss this possibility,  
5-6528.

Thanks,
Shelley

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

AZ

Hi

I've attached a couple of files summarizing our progress and current status on modeling the bid-ask spread.  The first summarizes characterization of the EOL Crude data and the second describes a bid-ask spread model based on options theory developed by Zimin (The figure from the paper is included separately).  I am now setting up an Excel spreadsheet to test this model with the EOL data.

Let me know when you would like to meet to review this.

Thanks, Bob Lee

FYI. The ClickPaper group in Industrial Markets asked my permission to be able to say, "ClickPaper will be upgraded to operate via the EnronOnline platform."  I have asked them to delete the reference to EnronOnline and simply claim that this is a new version with many enhancements and new features. 

While it may seem like their message gives a plug to EnronOnline, I think it will confuse the audience on what exactly is the relationship between ClickPaper and EnronOnline.  Also, we have little control over how Industrial Markets will promote ClickPaper and I don't want the market to think that any issues with ClickPaper somehow are a poor reflection on EnronOnline.

Market Forces - Problems in cyberspace.

When the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) announced last May it was
building an electronic trading platform, it said its eNymex trading system
would be up and running by the autumn. The aim was to steal some of the
thunder from the launch of the Big Oil-backed IntercontinentalExchange (ICE),
which was set to start up around the same time.

In the event, ICE launched on time last October and has since built up trading
volumes and attracted new participants. It has also won support for its offer
to buy London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), giving it more
firepower in the e-trading sector.
Nymex, meanwhile, continues to struggle, and has repeatedly pushed back its
launch date. More recently, the exchange's problems have been legal. It has
filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against one of the partners that was
helping build the eNymex trading system, prompting some observers to speculate
that the electronic trading platform will suffer more delays.

A big piece of eNymex was being developed by GlobalView Software. The
Chicago-based firm was picked to build the software connection between the
trading engine, designed by start-up technology company Kiodex, and the web
page layout, developed by Fry Multimedia. Nymex said in a filing with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission that it terminated the relationship with
GlobalView because of performance issues under the contract. Shortly after
kicking GlobalView off the project, Nymex filed the suit in the New York State
Supreme Court. GlobalView is now preparing a countersuit in New York.

Although GlobalView was announced as an eNymex partner in March, the company
had begun work back in December. GlobalView chief executive Jon Olson says
that "almost immediately there were issues." He adds: "Our view is they were
financial issues." With GlobalView gone, Nymex is reviewing its options, which
include choosing another software provider.

Nymex has also dismissed consulting firm Accenture (formerly Andersen
Consulting), which had helped manage the New York exchange's transition to an
electronic trading platform from the early days. A Nymex spokeswoman says that
Accenture's work was complete. One observer, however, characterizes Nymex's
recent actions as cost-cutting moves.

Despite the setbacks, Nymex continues to say that testing of the system will
be complete this summer, with a full-scale rollout planned soon after. With
eNymex, none of the exchange's existing futures contracts will be switched to
the new platform. Instead, eNymex will focus on derivatives, new territory for
the New York exchange. Some smaller oil futures contracts will also be put
online. Nymex has fired early shots at the ICE/IPE duo, recently announcing
plans to launch a Brent futures contract that will compete with the IPE's
flagship product (EC May 4, p3).

Although Nymex's electronic trading system has yet to launch, the platform has
already been picked by US technology consultants Forrester Research as one of
the few energy e-trade winners. But one executive at a rival exchange wonders
how Forrester can say that eNymex will succeed when the system has yet to be
tested in the market.

I am talking to GFI for North America.  GFI originally called us concerning Europe but backed down and didnt want to pay. I will ask again if they want Europe. 

Natsource Europe is in contract discussions with us for Europe and UK Gas and Power.  They asked us to throw in coal and the coal group said no.  I have tried to get them to change their position as this will add liquidity.  Ask them why they do not want Natsource. They pay nothing for executions by Natsource. 

TFS has not been contacted concerning Europe.  Feel free to contact them and try to get a deal.  Call me to discuss.

According to the International Coal desk, the three brokers that have expressed interest are:

-	TFS
-	GFI
-	NatSource

Apparently the desk is not as enthusiastic about NatSource from their perspective, though they would be happy to see the other two getting access.

Let me know if I can further assist.

Thanks,

Hi Andy,

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

Thanks!

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

Hi, Andy,

I am very interested in the position you advertised. I have a PhD. in X-ray Crystallography, and an MBA in Finance. I have extensive experience in options analysis, and quite familiar with TAGG/ERMS. 
I have a strong financial and quantitative background as you can see from the attached resume.
I'd like to have an opportunity to use my financial and quantitative analysis skills.


Thanks!

Dave

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm
hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell
the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have
read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live
and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this
pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend
Andy

Hi Andy,

I'm not sure if Andy Lewis explained to you what we were working on with
Enron.  Basically, our team is responsible for creating a performance
simulation to replace Enron's Basic Risk Management course. Along with the
simulation, a Knowledge System (series of html pages) will be delivered to
each learner. This Knowledge System is a series of topics or "chapters"
each consisting of content that will help the learner perform throughout
the simulation. Think of this as a encyclopedia, where the learner can go
to as a source of reference. Topics include, but are not limited to:
Hedging Basics, Risk Identification, Swaps, Options, Commodity
Fundamentals, and Accounting & Reporting.

I've attached the topic outline for Swaps and the practice exercises and
graphics section of the Knowledge System for you to review.
(See attached file: Framework Swaps_Final.doc)(See attached file: Swaps
Graphic ideas and practices_5.doc)

Sheri and I are responsible for this Knowledge System and would like your
help in the Swaps topic. Specifically, we would like you to help us with
practice exercises the learner will complete within the Swaps topic and
graphic ideas that will also support the content in this topic. In
addition, we are hoping you can provide us with some of the questions that
is outlined in the topic outline.(see above)

I will still like to meet with you this afternoon at 3:00pm, so let me know
what your schedule looks like.

Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at X5-6687.

Thanks,

Andy, that's very helpful.  I hope that as technology improves and the notion of "web services" becomes more widely accepted as a substitute for "behind the firewall" applications, the opportunity exists for Kiodex to serve the broader universe of customers.  But I agree that there should be lots of low-hanging fruit among the many users of derivatives for whom trading is not a core activity.

Stewart, 
I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management 
products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we 
dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can 
get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? " 
The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that 
where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third 
party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the 
obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs 
to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the 
product but don't view the function as critical to their operation. 
For what it is worth. 
Andy

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

How's it going?  Any thoughts on the AGA number?  We think it is a bunch of BS although all the entries I saw on the Fundamentals Message Board about people selling storage gas give one pause.  HOw are things going on the flying front?  I took my brother-in-law up last night and thankfully managed two good landings.  MJ
