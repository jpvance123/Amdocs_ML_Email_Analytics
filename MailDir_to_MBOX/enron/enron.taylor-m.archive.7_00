As we discussed, the following is proposed disclosure language regarding 
direct access:

EnronOnline will provide users, upon request, with "T1" lines or other means 
of direct access to EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access, 
provided that the users will be responsible for all costs associated with the 
establishment of direct access.  Direct access connections might enable users 
to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access.

In terms of placement, I think this disclosure could initially be included on 
the "ticker", as we discussed.  However, once users begin to establish direct 
connections, it should probably be included as well in the "Legal and 
Privacy" notices or in the ETA.  We should discuss after you have had a 
chance to consider the language.  Thanks.

Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. 

Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time?

I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I 
understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue.

Subject: EOL Passwords

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick

Here is the offending piece from the SFA.  As you will see, it is not a 
binding piece of regulation, but merely a non-binding "Discussion Paper".  In 
fact it is even less binding than "Consultation" documents (also non-binding) 
which SFA put out following the discussion phase.

It does, however, provide some insight into how the SFA might regulate 
systems in the future.

I get about one of these a day from SFA and must say I missed this one.  I 
will ask our external counsel (Linklaters) to watch out for any SFA 
publications which may be relevant to Enron Online going forward and to bring 
them to our attention.  I suggest Justin and Edmund also stress this to any 
other external English counsel who may be advising us on Online.

Mark

I understand that you oversee the legal issues/contracts relating to our 
financial trading activities and consequently was hoping you might be able to 
assist us in regard to the following query that relates to sourcing data from 
external financial information providers.

I work in EnronCredit.com as a Telecommunication analyst and am interested in 
accessing the above information source which is provided by Thomson 
Financial.  FYI, "FirstCall" allows online realtime access to a wide variety 
of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.

We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a "C. 
Weber" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.

Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial 
here in London on the basis that we are a "corporate" and not a "financial" 
or "fund manager".  Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced 
time-delayed service ("Investex") which is not sufficient for our needs and 
consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service 
providing similar or superior functionality.

Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten 
us on any of the following:

- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson 
Financial in the US;
- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data 
supplier;
- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do 
receive.

I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall 
service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here 
in the UK.  Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it 
would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, 
sources of information are available, in order that we might have another 
option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of 
supplying FristCall.

Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.

Thanks for your help with this.

Regards

Carol,

I've reviewed the attached questionnaire and have the following comments:

1.  Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a 
non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties 
where such countparties are "vetted" before trading commences.  It seems 
that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then 
such an offerings can be made.

2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply 
to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant 
to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican 
entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay 
Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please 
refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments 
pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided 
to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT 
tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such 
payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax 
counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's "No" 
response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted 
through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards.

Mark,
I have attached a confirmation for a Lumber swap that was done today. The 
deal will have weekly Calculations with the prices in the publication coming 
out every Friday. However, payments will be made on a monthly basis.

Thank you very much for your help in this matter. Please give me a call if 
you have you any questions or if I can be of any help to you.

Sara and I were told this morning, by our London office, that the MG 
acquisition has closed.  Based on what we have heard about MG's New York 
activities, that may mean that Enron is now the owner of some 
CFTC/NFA-licensees (such as FCM's, CTA's, pool operators, etc.).

I realize we may well not have acquired the domestic businesses to which I am 
referring, and if we have, someone may already be addressing this.  
Regardless -- do you think it would be a good idea for us to focus on this 
Monday, i.e., get with whoever is overseeing the MG acquisition from ENA 
Legal's perspective, and just make sure futures regulatory issues are being 
properly addressed?  let me know what you think -- Bob

Matt-

I am unsure as to what Mike Dahlke is referencing when utilizing the term 
"Business Model Patent".  If you believe it appropriate, perhaps you could 
clarify this with him.

I note, that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a 
conference call that was in progress.  The question that Jae Moo had raised 
was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese 
authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be 
categorized as a  commodity derivative, as opposed to a financial 
derivative.  I informed the participants on the call that in Japan, weather 
derivatives are considered financial in nature, most analagous under the 
Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions. The basis 
for this, is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather 
derivative, as would be possible in a commodity type transaction, therefore 
resulting in the classification of a financial derivative.

If I may be of further assistance, please contact me.  My office phone number 
in Tokyo is 81-3 5219-4578.

Cheers,

John

Alan, Mark,David, John, Edmund

I had a telephone conference with Kim & Chang/Enron Korea this afternoon. The 
meeting was initiated by Mike Dahlke (APACHI Regulatory Affairs) and Jae Moo 
Lee (Enron Korea).

Attendence:
Mike Dahlke (Enron)
Jae Moo Lee (Enron)
Michelle Lee (Enron)
Matt Lee (Enron- by telephone)
SK Hong (Kim & Chang)


Summary of issues discussed: 

1. Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative 
or a Financial Derivative, since Korea has no experience with such a product. 

2. Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture 
Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or 
received. Financial Derivatives are not defined.

3. Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for 
each trade. Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of 
Korea for each trade. Failure to make report or obtain approval means the 
Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment. 

4. Bank of Korea has informally advised K&C that, for Commodity Derivatives, 
the report can be made by the foreign counterparty (ie. Enron) and, 
notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report,  can be done as soon as 
possible after the trade confirmation. However, Bank of Korea has the 
discretion to reject any report made. This would make a trade effectively 
unperformable or unenforceable.

5. Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April 1999 and 
informally informed K&C that they have yet to receive a single report. Prior 
to April 1999, reports were made to certain designated banks.

6. K&C advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty, it would 
have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is 
hedging, but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign 
copunterparty makes the report. I am of the opinion that this statement 
should be viewed with caution, especially since there is really no expereince 
in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea.

7. For Financial Derivatives, prior approval is required before a trade is 
done and may take 3 to 5 days.

8. The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean 
entities.

9. In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified, K&C 
recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation. The 
Ministry of Finance and Economy (which is the legislative authority) may have 
to be approached if Bank of Korea is unable/unwilling to make a decision. 
Such lobbying is likely to be protracted. I have asked K&C to make informal 
enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather 
Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives, and whether it 
would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives.

10. K&C also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of 
Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather 
Derivatives. K&C was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may 
view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company "out to make lots of 
money".

11. Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan 
which he had spoken with John V. about. John - could you fill me in, in case 
applicable to Korea?

It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting to/approval from 
Bank of Korea.  The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives, 
and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives 
potentially offered out of Enron Japan. The Korean regulations do not seem to 
accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading, let alone instantaneous 
online derivative trading.

Please advise next steps, in particular, do the commercial guys want to 
proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated.

Meanwhile, I attach my comments and queries of K&C's memorandum for your 
review. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for 
me to revert to K&C.




Regards
Matt

Subject: Tax Advice on AUS and JPN CDD and HDD Weather Swaps

Below is a summary of the tax advice that I received from our outside=20
advisors in Tokyo and Sydney on the Sydney trading office entering into cas=
h=20
settled weather derivative trades with Japanese counterparties:

Japanese Tax Advice

1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various kinds of excise taxes.  These excise taxes generally apply =
to=20
physical importation and domestic sale and delivery of covered products and=
=20
should generally not apply to purely financial derivatives transactions whi=
ch=20
reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.


Australian Tax Advice

1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the summaries of the products attached to Justin Timothy=01,s June=
 12th=20
e-mail to Mario Parra Cardoso and Dale Neuner:

(1) the swap income or deduction should be recognized on a due and payable=
=20
basis (rather than on an accrual basis over the term of the swap), and
(2) there should not be any interest withholding tax imposed on the swap=20
payments because there does not appear to be any linkage between the swap=
=20
payment and "interest" as defined for Australian tax purposes.

Note that there is an Australian tax proposal to impose withholding tax on=
=20
other Australian source income.  Although no details are yet available, it =
is=20
expected that the Australian government will not impose withholding tax whe=
re=20
the income would constitute "business profits" of any entity in a treaty=20
country (such as Japan) which does not have permanent establishment in=20
Australia.  Thus, based on the current proposal, it is unlikely that such a=
=20
withholding tax, if enacted, would apply to the swap payments.  However, th=
is=20
could change depending upon the rules actually enacted.

2. GST (VAT)

Effective July 1, 2000, the Goods and Services Tax ("GST") will tax at a 10=
%=20
rate the consumption of most goods and services in Australia.  (It does not=
=20
apply to consumption outside of Australia, e.g. exports.)

A swap payment to a Japanese counterparty will be GST-free. This means that=
=20
the Australian trading office would be able to claim refunds on a portion o=
f=20
the GST paid on its rents and other expenses.


Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the 
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on 
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.

2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.  
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am 
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just 
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you 
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.


3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should 
know more after next Wednesday.


Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Carol

Hi Carol,

All I need is a note from the Dr. showing the delivery date.  If you are 
planning on taking any additional time, it must be cleared by your supervisor 
prior to you leaving.
I can give you a form to return once the baby is born if you are going to add

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick

No problem on the crib.  As for Mexico setoff, I am aware.  I was under the 
impression that even setoff among common entities is questionable.  My 
rationale is that we will almost certainly trade with any given cp through 
one Enron entity or the other, and not both.  If I am wrong, we will manage 
the process internally (i.e. cut the cp's credit line in half).

Thanks.  I expect to get a new draft of the Schedules from DB later today.  
As for the crib, it is perfect and Bill and a friend managed to put it 
together.  Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will have 
a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is 
that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done 
with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

Pursuant to our conversation today, we would appreciate your thoughts on the 
attached advice and whether it is too "risky" for us to proceed using Enron 
Japan as the counterparty for weather derivatives in light of how we have 
assessed the risk in other jurisdictions regarding weather derivatives. I 
will also being forwarding to you the June 13 e-mail advice mentioned in the 
attached memo. The referenced January 14, 2000 memorandum is quite lengthy, 
but I can forward to you by e-mail if you would like. Let me know what you 
think as soon as you can; sometime this week would be very helpful. Thanks a

Hi Alan-

I will give you a ring your Monday morning to discuss B&M's attached advice 
and other issues.  Based on the advice, I think we are in pretty good shape 
with the contemplated activities, not totally risk-free, but with "relatively 
low" risk so long as we institute certain procedures and ensure that the 
GTC's reflect their comments.  It has been pretty busy here, primarily 
operational/administrative work and all, thus far, is proceeding smoothly.  

Cheers,

John

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

Subject: Re: OTC commodity derivative  

Dear Ms. Hong,

Thank you very much for the information.  

I had a chance to talk to Hyundai Oil regarding the report requirement issue 
as well as other business issues.  According to Hyundai Oil, they always put 
2 to 4 deals together, days or sometimes weeks after the deals have been 
made, each time they file a report  to BOK.   Such ex post facto package 
report is acceptable to BOK as far as the deals do not fall into one of the 2 
categories specified in the FX Transaction Regulation (deals with option 
premium higher than 20% or deals with room for illegality).   In fact, the 
number of oil paper transactions that Hyundai Oil has done is more than 20, 
and Hyundai Oil did not have any problems getting the reports filed with the 
BOK.   It sometimes took 1 week and sometimes 2 to 3 days, and Hyundai Oil 
did not really care how long it would take because both Hyundai and the BOK 
understood that the reports were (or had to be) a formality to be made for 
the deals already done.   

Other companies including SK Corp., Samsung and LG that we contacted use 
their Singapore branch as a vehicle for legal documentation (although Seoul 
HQ makes decision) and do not have to file such reports.  The reason for 
using their Singapore branches is not the report requirement hassle but their 
strategic and organizational issues, they said.

Regards,

Jae-Moo

We contacted the responsible officers of the BOK and confirmed that the BOK 
received 7 or 8 reports since April last year (when the rules changed) 
regarding OTC commodity derivative transactions and all of them were filed by 
Hyundai Oil Refinery in connection with oil derivatives.  It appears those 
reports were accepted by the BOK.  The review and processing of the reports 
would generally take 1 or 2 weeks.  Regards,

Subject: The Plan!

We have started to contact EnronOnline customers with regard to the EBS 
connection to EnronOnline - I am pretty sure that the strategy is as set out 
below.  Please let me know if anyone thinks differently.

The connections will be T1, as opposed to larger DS3 connections.  Originally 
it had been envisaged that DS3s would be provisioned in order to then upsell 
rich content.  As EnronOnline only requires a T1 or less, it has been decided 
that at this time, it would be more appropriate to provision the T1s.

EBS will contract directly for the full connection service with the 
EnronOnline customer (eg Dynegy and EBS).  

EBS will bill the customer directly in accordance with the cost sharing 
arrangement which the EnronOnline team negotiates with the customer.  For 
example, EnronOnline pays for the network portion with the customer paying 
for the local loop and any router charges.

Customers will receive the connection in approximately 45 (+ or minus 15 
days).

EBS currently has a list of all companies to be connected in Phase 1.  (David 
Mims)

EBS to furnish EnronOnline with the costs as soon as possible in order for 
EnronOnline to agree a cost sharing arrangement with its customers.

Should work I think - we look forward to faster trading.

Alan, Mark,David, John, Edmund

I had a telephone conference with Kim & Chang/Enron Korea this afternoon. The 
meeting was initiated by Mike Dahlke (APACHI Regulatory Affairs) and Jae Moo 
Lee (Enron Korea).

Attendence:
Mike Dahlke (Enron)
Jae Moo Lee (Enron)
Michelle Lee (Enron)
Matt Lee (Enron- by telephone)
SK Hong (Kim & Chang)


Summary of issues discussed: 

1. Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative 
or a Financial Derivative, since Korea has no experience with such a product. 

2. Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture 
Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or 
received. Financial Derivatives are not defined.

3. Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for 
each trade. Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of 
Korea for each trade. Failure to make report or obtain approval means the 
Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment. 

4. Bank of Korea has informally advised K&C that, for Commodity Derivatives, 
the report can be made by the foreign counterparty (ie. Enron) and, 
notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report,  can be done as soon as 
possible after the trade confirmation. However, Bank of Korea has the 
discretion to reject any report made. This would make a trade effectively 
unperformable or unenforceable.

5. Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April 1999 and 
informally informed K&C that they have yet to receive a single report. Prior 
to April 1999, reports were made to certain designated banks.

6. K&C advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty, it would 
have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is 
hedging, but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign 
copunterparty makes the report. I am of the opinion that this statement 
should be viewed with caution, especially since there is really no expereince 
in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea.

7. For Financial Derivatives, prior approval is required before a trade is 
done and may take 3 to 5 days.

8. The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean 
entities.

9. In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified, K&C 
recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation. The 
Ministry of Finance and Economy (which is the legislative authority) may have 
to be approached if Bank of Korea is unable/unwilling to make a decision. 
Such lobbying is likely to be protracted. I have asked K&C to make informal 
enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather 
Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives, and whether it 
would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives.

10. K&C also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of 
Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather 
Derivatives. K&C was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may 
view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company "out to make lots of 
money".

11. Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan 
which he had spoken with John V. about. John - could you fill me in, in case 
applicable to Korea?

It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting to/approval from 
Bank of Korea.  The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives, 
and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives 
potentially offered out of Enron Japan. The Korean regulations do not seem to 
accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading, let alone instantaneous 
online derivative trading.

Please advise next steps, in particular, do the commercial guys want to 
proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated.

Meanwhile, I attach my comments and queries of K&C's memorandum for your 
review. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for 
me to revert to K&C.




Regards
Matt

Dear Derivatives Week Subscriber: 

I thought you might be interested in this breaking news story reported by our 
sister publication, BondWeek: 

==================================================== 
Persistent buzz that had Nomura Securities International shuttering its 
mortgage derivatives desk and liquidating its portfolio is completely 
unfounded, 
according to Nomura's fixed income chief Alex Noujaim. Rumors that Nomura 
was bailing from the CMO market have weighed on the market for more than 
a week and gained credence from a research report put out by a rival firm.

David-

Thank you for passing the Australian GTC's on to us.  As to B&M's position on 
the gambling issue, they are not prepared to provide us with a clean opinion, 
however they will specify how we might minimize the associated risks, which 
appear to be minimal.  I expect to receive their formal advice today and 
will  forward same upon receipt.

The Enron company that is specified on the Passwords Applications and ETAs 
that are being sent out is presently ENA.  

Cheers,

John

John please see attached GTCs for Australian weather. They are essentially 
the same as the example that was forwarded to B&M when they got the brief to 
advise on weather derivatives last month. 

I understand that B & M are having second thoughts on the gambling question 
and are due to come in with an advice on the point. 

There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron 
Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. or Enron Japan KK. From a tax perspective Susan 
what would you prefer? 

On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and 
ETAs that are being sent out? Although from a legal perspective it does not 
matter it may increase acceptance if it were Enron Japan KK.

Please find my comments attached.

I am hoping to get a quote on the professional liability insurance this
week.  Two of the underwriters called my broker to get further information
on Monday of last week, and two declined to quote because of they will
not underwrite anything having to do with commodities.  I am also expecting
a quote from the broker which Intelligence Press uses.

sell the site to us.  We currently own www.weather-risk.com and would like to 
get rid of the "-" if we could.  We have tentatively negotiated a price of 
$15,000 for this site.  I would like to sit down with you to discuss our next 
steps, concerns, issues, etc... at your earliest convenience.

Please call me to discuss this or to schedule time.

Thanks and regards,
Gary Taylor

I think it would be helpful if we met sometime soon to "take inventory" as to 
our legal entity structures (thus far) for the Enron Net Works "family".  
There has been a fair amount of entity formation (and, perhaps, commercial 
activity) and I want to make sure the all entities and assets are where they 
are suppose to be.

To that end, please contact my assistant, Darlene Forsyth (x3754) as to your 
availability over the next week so we may take an hour or so to compare notes.
Thanks.

Subject: DealBench

As most of us have discussed, Harry Arora's group has been developing an 
e-commerce site now known as DealBench.com (formerly EnronDirectFinance).  
This site is being launched as an information dissemination/deal platform 
whose closest competitor is Intralinks.  DealBench's customers will be banks, 
law firms, and other businesses who desire a secure internet platform to 
conduct business transactions online.  Customers will license use of the site 
pursuant to written agreements.  Several trademark applications have been 
filed by Enron Corp. for the site.  Lawyers from Vinson & Elkins in Austin 
(Bob Baird and Dean Harvey) and Houston (Steve Borgman) have been assisting 
us in various legal matters relating to the site.

At this point, the commercial team desires to move ahead with a limited 
liability entity to own and operate the DealBench business.  Based upon input 
from many of you, the proposal is to form a simple, single-member, 
owner-managed Delaware limited liability company named DealBench L.L.C.  The 
sole owner would be Enron Net Works LLC.  Upon formation, all assets and 
liabilities of the DealBench business will be assigned to, and assumed by the 
new LLC.  We understand that the private placement being contemplated by Net 
Works will be through a separate legal entity and currently does not 
contemplate the DealBench business.  We also understand that DealBench's 
ownership by Net Works will not preclude future flexibility in DealBench's 
ownership.

The commercial team desires to move forward with formation of DealBench 
L.L.C. this week.  Based upon your input, we will proceed as outlined above.  
If you have any other thoughts or suggestions, please let me know.  Thanks 
for your help.

Regards, NJD

Subject: Re: EOL GTC's for Weather Derivatives In Australia  

Let me add a couple of observations to Alan's explanation. There will be 
different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is 
planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the 
Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian 
State) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only 
differences currently relate to different data sources.

There may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to 
accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the 
incorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to 
ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the 
possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore 
although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a 
counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a 
transaction would be relevant.

However, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for 
conformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated 
company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude 
derivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs 
the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular 
Japanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that 
is currently followed.

Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese 
weather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff.

We are currently having the GTCs for Australian weather reviewed by local 
counsel in Japan for conformity to Japanese law. We will likely have their 
comments by early next week (they know there is an urgency to this matter). 
My current view is that we probably can have one set of GTCs as long as the 
additional language (e.g., representations) suggested by local Japanese 
counsel for the Japanese counterpaties would not be confusing to the 
Australian counterparties who would be entering into the Australian weather 
products. 

I also want David Minns, who will be back from vacation on Monday, to review 
and approve the final approach on documentation for the two geographical 
products offered by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.

I think there is some confusion here. I had a conversation with Alan 
yesterday and at the close was under the impression that we would be using a 
single GTC for both Aus and Jpn , but that the existing GTC needed to be 
adjusted with respect to Japanese Weather products in the 'Relationship to 
Party' and 'Additional Representation' sections.

Alan - please confirm this via return e-mail.

You should coordinate with David Minns early next week when he comes back to 
make sure that the Japanese version of the on-line GTCs includes the 
appropriate representations from our counterparties, as recommended by B&M. 
Also, if B&M has not already done so we should have them take a quick look at 
the attached for any additional changes for the Japanese market.

I understand from Dale Neuner of EOL Houston who is responsible for the 
uploading of the GTCs that the final GTCs for Japan weather need to be into 
Houston preferably sometime next week since the launch is July 26. Thanks.

John please see attached GTCs for Australian weather. They are essentially 
the same as the example that was forwarded to B&M when they got the brief to 
advise on weather derivatives last month. 

I understand that B & M are having second thoughts on the gambling question 
and are due to come in with an advice on the point. 

There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron 
Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. or Enron Japan KK. From a tax perspective Susan 
what would you prefer? 

On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and 
ETAs that are being sent out? Although from a legal perspective it does not 
matter it may increase acceptance if it were Enron Japan KK.

Mark, I heard earlier today that the resolution of this matter has been to 
move confirmation/documentation to Calgary, but leave contract preparation 
and negotiation in Houston.  

I must admit disappoint with this bifurcated result, including for the 
following reasons:

1.  It has left, rightly or (I trust) wrongly, the impression that there is 
concern as to the ability of the Canadian lawyers to documment and negotiate 
the ISDAs, etc.  If this is the case, I do not share the concern.  The legal 
group in Canada is strong, deep, conscientious, and regularly excels at 
greater and more complex challenges which expose Enron Canada to greater 
risks in physical trading, origination, finance and structured transactions.

2.  For these reasons, the Canadian lawyers have the trust and confidence of 
the Canadian traders and originators, and their advice is sought and followed 
on all matters, including, frankly, financial trading.

3.  This result ignores the practical realities of time, space, efficiency, 
legal jurisdictions, marketplace knowledge and internal and external 
relationships.

4.  I feel that the we ought to have the opportunity to be exposed to, and be 
challenged by, all aspects of our business.

In any event, please let me know who will be responsible for legal oversight 
of confirmation/documentation of financial transactions.  For physical 
trading, we regularly advise on confirmation/documentation issues and, most 
notably, all structured trades and trades with a term of greater than one 
year are prepared and reviewed by Enron Canada legal.

Regards, Peter.

Subject: ClickPaper Process Flow diagrams

I don't know how much help you will find these, but I attach the process 
flows diagrams but I tried to get everyone's roles onto paper.  The main 
areas of note for me in having spent time looking at the process are (BIG 
CAVEAT is that I probably don't understand everything bearing in mind the 
small amount of time involved - so apologies first):

(i) The definitive legal framework is not yet available.  There appear to be 
too many documents to click on if you are the customer (ETA, Rules and GTC).  
The Master issue is also outstanding. Things like the Long Product 
Description which are fundamentally part of the contract process and their 
appearance is not clear to me on the website also the adding of new products 
is not subject to validation.  The easiest short term solution here is to 
make sure you do not post any products which are not available on EOL - 
therefore having gone through the process (see launching new products flow 
chart). 
(ii) The process is heavily dependent on the Ariba database and manual flows 
of information between all of the parties.  EOL has an automated email system 
which emails the notices around, making it less manual.  With the smaller 
number of players this is not a big risk but the people in ClickPaper Control 
will need to be high calibre in order to write up the procedures as they are 
implementing them.
(iii) The website currently is only available (I might be wrong but there is 
only one PA/ETA) to US customers.  



In case you don't have visio - here they are in PowerPoint.

Subject: MG

As you know, we are looking at doing the following with MG:

1) Moving the Market Maker Application into EnronOnline - effectively, by 
putting the same products on EnronOnline as are currently on Market Maker, 
then shutting down Market Maker and putting a hyperlink in to EnronOnline

2) Launching financial metals products on EnronOnline, which would transacted 
by MG.


I have some concerns about both of these activities.


(1) Until today, I did not realise that the Market Maker application actually 
involves the transaction of an LME contract. In other words, when a customer 
buys from MG on the Market Maker app, they are buying LME contracts. We have 
taken pains to distinguish between what we do on EnronOnline - which is to 
transact on products which might settle against a published price vs. 
transacting on the actual exchange contract.  As you know, Exchange contracts 
are subject to a different set of regulations and scrutiny than currently 
applies to EnronOnline.


(2) Because MG trades Exchange contracts on the floor of the exchange, they 
are subject to more stringent regulations than Enron. I am concerned that if 
MG is transacting financial products on EnronOnline, that EnronOnline could 
come under greater scrutiny by the SFA. Paul: Can you comment on whether or 
not this is a risk?  If this is a risk, would it be mitigated by having 
another Enron company handle EnronOnline transactions (with sleeving back to 
MG), or are we already sunk by virtue of the fact that MG is now in the Enron 
family?

Comments from any/all recipients invited . . .

Thanks,

Dave

David,

Attached please find the website text for the Capacity Generation Auction. I 
have made some changes and added a couple of new pages. Please review the 
changes (marked). Furthermore, I added a Bid page and a Bid List. This two 
pages are used as visual references by our developers. We need to make sure 
that they are correct, so please verify the information on them. Also, you 
need to come up with a short reference for your two products so they can fit 
on the drop down boxes and in the Bid List.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

As we discussed, the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access 
to deal with the cost issue:

EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for the connection 
of "T1" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline, as an 
alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access.

Please call if you want to discuss.  Have a good weekend.

Bob,

This e-mail describes the tax consequences arising from Enron North America 
Corp. ("ENA") offering to sell various pulp and paper products ("Products") 
through EnronOnline ("EOL") to counterparties throughout Europe whereby such 
Products would be stored in bonded warehouses located in the Netherlands.  As 
I understand, it is intended that any ENA counterparty located in Europe will 
be able to purchase Products from ENA and obtain physical possession of such 
Products by taking delivery within bonded warehouses located in the 
Netherlands that are owned by unrelated parties to whom ENA would make 
payments for providing storage space.  The tax consequences arising from 
ENA's sales of Products in the Netherlands are described below.  (I will 
follow-up as soon as possible to provide you with the tax consequences 
arising from ENA engaging in the same activity in Belgium.)


Sales within a bonded warehouse in The Netherlands

In general, sales of Products by ENA in the Netherlands may be subject to 
taxation in both the United States and the Netherlands, thus resulting in a 
combined effective tax rate equal to at least 58 percent.  By selling 
Products in a specific manner, however, ENA can substantially limit its 
exposure to taxation in the Netherlands and, by doing so, should only be 
subject to U.S. taxation (at a rate equal to 35 percent).

To limit its exposure to Dutch taxation on the sale of Products stored in a 
bonded warehouse in the Netherlands that is owned by an unrelated party, ENA 
should comply with all of the following criteria:

Other than the limited activity to be performed on behalf of ENA by the owner 
of the bonded warehouse ("Warehouseman") described below, all of ENA's 
activities related to the sale of Products to a counterparty should occur in 
the United States.  For example, the pricing for the Products to be offered 
should be determined by an ENA employee physically located in the U.S.  If 
any negotiations occur between ENA and a counterparty, the ENA employee 
engaged in negotiations should be physically located in the United States.  
If a contract is entered into between the parties, an ENA employee should 
execute the document while physically present in the United States.  (As I 
understand, those transactions effected through EOL occur by the counterparty 
making an offer (i.e., clicking on the "offer" icon contained in EOL) and are 
accepted by ENA if (among other things) the price related to the 
counterparty's offer is still valid.  If this is the case, then ENA's 
"acceptance" should be considered to occur in the U.S. if the individual with 
the authority to set prices is physically located in the U.S. when actually 
setting the price.)
ENA should enter into an agreement with the Warehouseman located in the 
Netherlands whereby the Warehouseman's only activities on behalf of ENA 
consist of storing the Products and making them available to the counterparty 
to take physical delivery at the warehouse.  The Warehouseman should not have 
the authority to engage in any other activity on behalf of ENA, including 
(but not limited to):  

  a.  negotiating any of the terms of the agreement between ENA and the 
counterparty;
  b.  concluding any agreement between ENA and the counterparty on behalf of 
ENA;
  c.  soliciting or receiving orders from a counterparty on behalf of ENA 
(and transmitting such orders back to ENA); and
  d.  delivering Products to counterparties on behalf of ENA.

Thus, for ENA to mitigate its risk of exposure to Dutch tax on sales of 
Products in the Netherlands, the Warehouseman should engage in only two 
activities on behalf of ENA:  storing the Products for a fee, and making such 
Products available to counterparties to take possession of them at the 
warehouse.  All other activities related to the sale of Products in the 
Netherlands should be undertaken by ENA in the United States.

If you have any questions, please contact me at ext. 35777.

Best regards,

Jeff

Dave,
Thank you for the prompt reply.
There are many areas where electronic signatures can reduce business costs
and enable new applications.  But, most importantly Enron and Enron Online
needs to know they can trust an electronic signature.  AlphaTrust can
serve as the 3rd party managing your electronic signatures including risk
management.  There are many costs associated with implementing an
electronic signature service with the polices and legal requirements.  And
typically there can be a 12-18 month time frame to implement.

AlphaTrust provides the infrastructure,
AlphaTrust provides the legal framework and fraud protection across all
jurisdictions including internationally,
AlphaTrust can enable your business to get started quickly.





I will call you next week to follow-up.  If you like we can coordinate a
call with your legal counsel and my CEO who understands the laws to a
great extent.

Thank you,
Randall Whitfield

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

I am also faxing you a copy of B&M's initial advice regarding the gambling 
issue, which I believe to contain a more concise explanation of the relevant 
issues and a better explanation as to what may be done to minimize our

Please give me a ring after you have had the opportunity to review B&M's

		 Subject: RE: ENRON Request for Further Advice


Dear John,

In relation to your specific questions, our answers are as follows:

1. We confirm that there are no regulatory approvals required to trade 
Japanese
weather derivatives whether or not the Enron counterparty is or is not
incorporated or resident of Japan.

2. No, except that trading weather derivatives online would make it more
difficult for Enron to ascertain the suitability of the counterparty (see
gambling issue below) as online transactions would probably allow very limited
due diligence opportunities. 

3. Enron will need to pay close attention to ensure that weather derivative
products are not considered "gambling" activities.  As discussed in our
memorandum of January 14, 2000, all derivative transactions may potentially
constitute gambling transactions.  If  the transaction does constitute 
gambling,
Enron may be exposed to criminal sanctions (if the activity is conducted in
Japan)  and  the contract may be declared void by a court and thus be
unenforceable.
 
Under Article 35 of the Criminal Code, there is a defense to any possible
criminal action if the transaction is entered into for legitimate purposes.  
To
determine whether the parties have a legitimate business purpose, a court 
would
need to look at all relevant facts and circumstances including the nature of 
the
derivative contract entered into and the underlying business of the
counterparties.  
 
There are four possible combinations of parties to these contracts:
        Case 1: Enron Non Japan/Japanese Resident
        Case 2: Enron Japan/Japanese Resident
        Case 3: Enron Japan/Non Japanese Resident
        Case 4: Enron Non Japan/Non Japanese Resident

In both cases 1 and 2, Enron needs to ensure that the Japanese counterparty 
has
a legitimate business purpose to confirm that the transaction does not fall
within Article 185 and 186 of the Criminal Code which would render the 
contract
unenforceable.

In cases 2 and 3, the need to comply with the law is also to ensure that Enron
Japan (and its officers) do not unwittingly commit criminal offences under the
Criminal Code. 

In cases 3 and 4, Enron would need to ensure that the counterparty is 
permitted
to enter into the transaction with Enron or Enron Japan without breaching the
law or regulation that might apply to derivatives in that country. 

 
Although we are not able to state conclusively that Enron will have no risk in
entering into weather derivatives in Japan, we consider that this risk will be
reduced if 
a. Enron entered into these transactions from offshore ;
b. Enron Japan is not involved in the marketing of these  transactions in any
way;
c. Enron obtains the representations below where the counterparties are 
Japanese
residents.   

Please answer the following questions if you are a Japanese entity:

To ensure that this transaction does not fall within Article 185 or 186 of the
Japanese Criminal Code, please confirm that:

a. you have read and fully understand the terms of the proposed transaction;

b. you are entering into this transaction to hedge weather related risk that
arises in the ordinary course of your business. 

If your answers are affirmative for both a and b above, Enron will rely on 
these
representations and regard your company as having a "legitimate business
purpose" to enter into this transaction as permitted under Article 35 of the
Criminal Code. 

As we mentioned above, while obtaining these representations could reduce the
risk of Enron from contracting with inappropriate parties, it obviously would
not catch inappropriate counterparties that knowingly answer the questions
falsely.  Therefore, to the extent possible, Enron should also conduct its own
due diligence with respect to the counterparty to confirm the suitability of 
the
transaction and to confirm that the counterparty has a legitimate business
purpose in entering into the transaction.  

4. We confirm that there should be no transaction tax applicable to weather
derivatives. 

5.  We confirmed with MITI that they are setting up a committee to draw up new
regulations for derivative transactions for industrial commodities (not for
weather) but they envisage that such regulations will not be ready for another
year. 

Regards,

PAD/AH
in consultation with JDP/ST/TS

Paul/Anne-

The scheduled date for the launch of EOL weather trading in Australia is
June 23rd.  We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka in addition to Australian
cities. Therefore, we need to have resolved all legal issues prior to this
date.  Below, we provide some background information and a basic
operational description of Enron Online, for your review.

We have also raised questions relating to this matter and look forward to
your prompt response.  As similar questions have been asked and answered
previously, we would hope to receive your responses by the end of this
week.

Background

1.   As you know, Enron Corp. has developed an online trading system using
the internet for a number of physical products and financial derivatives
which it or its subsidiaries trade.  This system is called Enron Online.  A
preview of the system is available on the internet at www.enrononline.com

2.   One category of product traded through EnronOnline is weather
derivatives.  Although there are differing types of weather derivatives
they all have a floating price linked to meteorological readings (e.g.
temperature, precipitation).

3.   Enron proposes to offer weather derivatives linked to meteorological
readings for Tokyo and Osaka (and potentially for other Japanese and
foreign cities) to counterparties resident in Japan.  Initially the Enron
contracting entity will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. that is
incorporated in a country other than Japan and that has no presence in
Japan.  Later, the Enron contracting entity may be a Japanese resident
corporation (e.g. Enron Japan Corp.).

4.   In your advice dated January 14, 2000 you generally indicated that
there would be no legal impediment to Enron trading OTC weather derivatives
in Japan.  We would ask that you expand on that advice.


Operation of EnronOnline


1.   EnronOnline allows counterparties to may make on line offers to Enron
in respect of one of the products listed on the screen. Enron may accept
this offer through an on line response thereby forming a contract.

2.   A potential counterparty wishing to trade through EnronOnline contacts
Enron and fills out a registration form. Enron will make its credit
assessment on the counterparty. If accepted the counterparty is required to
sign a password agreement and is issued a password.

3.   The first time a counterparty logs onto the system with its approved
password it will be required to agree to an electronic trading Agreement
(ETA) by clicking the "I Agree" Box after scrolling thought the ETA.

4.   For each traded product there will be available online a set of
contract terms known as "General Terms and Conditions" (GTC).  The GTC is
supplemented by a product description.  A draft product description for a
weather derivative for a Japanese city is enclosed.  A sample GTC for an
Australian weather derivative is also provided.  The GTCs for a Japanese
city weather derivative would be similar but would reference Japanese
weather stations.

5.   A counterparty transacts through EnronOnline by "clicking" and
submitting an online offer to Enron.  The offer may or may not be accepted
by Enron. The counterparty will receive notification that either the trade
was successful or that their offer was not accepted. The ETA specifies that
acceptance occurs when the Enron message hits the server.

Would you please advise on the following points.

1.   Please reconfirm your previous advice that there are no regulatory
approvals required  to trade Japanese weather derivatives where the Enron
counterparty is resident in   Japan. Would you please consider both the
circumstance (i) where the Enron         contracting party to the weather
derivative is neither incorporated nor resident in           Japan and (ii)
where the Enron contracting party to the weather derivative is
incorporated or resident in Japan.

2.    Do  any  of your conclusions in your previous advice that OTC weather
   derivatives  can   be offered legally in Japan, whether based on weather
   readings  for  Japanese locations       or foreign locations, need to be
   modified if the OTC weather derivatives can be traded          via Enron
   Online?

3.    Any  impact  the  legislation  regulating  gambling may have on these
   products.

4.    Please  reconfirm  that  there  would  not  be  any transaction taxes
   applying to weather   derivatives.

5.    Any  other  material  legal  issues that you advise are applicable to
   these types of        products.

We are also providing below, for your review, a sample swap product
description and our General Terms and Conditions for Australia heating
degree day swaps.

Best regards,

John

Edmund changed the contract description.
LME + COMEX are fine with Enron using their names + prices.

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Guys,
 Paul Simon's has advised us that EnronOnline will need to include standard 
SFA language on each Home Page in the garden area where we are promoting the 
services of EnronOnline as we are offering a system which would allow a 
registered user to enter into financial products. This would inculde the 
EnronOnline main Home page in addition to all the new URLs that we are 
setting up for the different markets.
Paul should be able to suppply theh standard disclaimner language required.
regards
Nick

Paul could you please send the standard language thate would be required to 
Dave Samuels.

Dave,
Thank you for the prompt reply.
There are many areas where electronic signatures can reduce business costs
and enable new applications.  But, most importantly Enron and Enron Online
needs to know they can trust an electronic signature.  AlphaTrust can
serve as the 3rd party managing your electronic signatures including risk
management.  There are many costs associated with implementing an
electronic signature service with the polices and legal requirements.  And
typically there can be a 12-18 month time frame to implement.

AlphaTrust provides the infrastructure,
AlphaTrust provides the legal framework and fraud protection across all
jurisdictions including internationally,
AlphaTrust can enable your business to get started quickly.





I will call you next week to follow-up.  If you like we can coordinate a
call with your legal counsel and my CEO who understands the laws to a
great extent.

Thank you,
Randall Whitfield

Thank you for your message.  Let me know if there is anything I should be 
doing to help you out from this side.     

I have attached the list of countries in which the Pulp and Paper group 
expect to have clients that will be active traders on Clickpaper.com.  I 
believe that EOL has ETAs and Password Applications prepared for these 
jurisdictions, but I'm not sure where we stand on Singapore, South Africa or 
Ireland.  Justin, you probably know where we are with Ireland, -- Alan or 
Mark -- any idea on where we may stand in South Africa or Singapore?

Justin, I would assume that the form of ETA that EOL currently uses for a 
particular jurisdiction could be revised to reflect  Clickpaper as the 
counterparty, but I noticed that EOL's form of ETA is with a UK entity.  
Should Clickpaper adopt the same structure for trading in Europe?

the countries to work on for the ETC and Password Application are:

Austria
Belgium
Finland
France
Ireland
Italy
Netherlands
Portugal
Sinagapore
South Africa
Spain

United Kingdom

The only ones not on the EOL list are Ireland, Singapore and South Africa.  
Let me know what is required to Clickpaperize the EOL stuff and also what do 
we do about GTC physical and financial (ie are these country specific too).

Thanks for sending the chart.  I will send you the list of questions we 
discussed tomorrow.  In the interim, I had a couple of questions on the 
chart:  On the first line (physical, no master), is the basis for not 
requriing the confirm to be signed the UCC?  Also, what is meant by "unless 
commodity not 'good'"?

Thanks.

We contacted the responsible officers of the BOK and confirmed that the BOK 
received 7 or 8 reports since April last year (when the rules changed) 
regarding OTC commodity derivative transactions and all of them were filed by 
Hyundai Oil Refinery in connection with oil derivatives.  It appears those 
reports were accepted by the BOK.  The review and processing of the reports 
would generally take 1 or 2 weeks.  Regards,

This topic has moved up on the radar screen over here.  In addition to the
issues about setting up the shell corporation, what are the rules for the
Enron affliliates who trade on line?  Josie Castrejana in our credit group
has talked to Tom Moran in your credit group.  EOTT is concerned about
credit issues for the shell corporation.  How do you handle that with the
other Enron affiliates?  Who would post letters of credit or guaranties?
How does the contract get from the Enron affiliate to EOTT--is the contract
assigned or do we do back to back deals?  If this is a physical
transaction, we need to figure out a way to coordinate names on the
contract, credit, invoice, ticket, etc.  Also, who would nominate the
volumes?

Needless to say, we are not finished yet.  Please let me know when you
would be available to go over these issues.  Thanks so much for your help.

Subject: FW: Weather and Oil Derivatives

John,

I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon regarding our advice 
(copy
below) and confirm the matters discussed as follows:

1. We note your conversation with Terry Tanaka of IBJ in which he commented
that it was his understanding that the FSA had given informal approval for 
banks
to conduct weather derivative transactions.  This gives banks who engage in
weather derivative transactions (and their counterparties) a possible 
additional
argument that the transaction are "being conducted in accordance with law" for
the purposes of the defense in Article 35 of the Criminal Code.

 This does not change our advice with respect to transactions between
Enron Japan and non-bank counterparties.

 However, if Enron Japan were to enter into a weather derivative with a
bank, Enron Japan would be able to rely on the tacit approval given by the FSA
to the bank - but only to the extent to which the bank would be willing to
represent and warrant to Enron Japan that the bank was authorised to enter 
into
the transaction under Japanese laws and regulations.

2. We note your comment regarding the possibility that Enron Japan would
enter into back-to-back transaction with an offshore Enron affiliate and thus
transfer all risk in relation to the weather derivative transactions outside
Japan.  As mentioned in our advice, one of the factors that will suggest that
Enron Japan is engaged in a "legitimate business activity" will be the fact 
that
Enron Japan manages the risk under the transactions that it enters into and 
does
not take purely speculative positions.  Entering into back-to-back 
transactions
is one way in which Enron Japan may manage risk.  However, there are also 
other
risk management techniques (such as hedging in local markets - to the extent
possible - or hedging in offshore markets).  Insofar as these different risk
management techniques are all effective methods of risk management, we do not
believe that any one method of risk management is necessarily preferable to
another.

3. We have checked the home page for the Japanese Financial Law Board and
confirm that it does not contain any information directly relevant to weather
derivatives.  The home page does contain discussion of the application of the
Criminal Law to financial derivatives generally, but simply notes that the
parties to a financial derivative that is not specifically authorised by law
cannot rely on the "act in accordance with law" defense under Article 35 of 
the
Criminal Law.

4. You have asked us whether we would be able to change our risk assessment
from "relatively low" to "extremely low".  We are most reluctant to change our
view.  Our difficulty is that the risk of possible action by the regulators or
by the police is extremely difficult to predict and it is therefore necessary
for us to take a slightly cautious approach.

 We do note that similar concerns about gambling were raised when swaps
were first introduced in Japan in the 1980s and again when new derivatives
products such as oil derivatives and equity derivatives were introduced in the
1990s.  However, as far as we are aware, no prosecutions have ever been
commenced in Japan alleging that swap or derivative transaction constitute
gambling.

5. In our advice we identified a number of factors that tend to raise or
lower the risk of possible action.  We would like to emphasise that, if Enron
Japan does commence weather derivative trading in Japan, Enron Japan should:

* clearly add specific representations regarding the "legitimate business"
issue in its contract documentation;

* establish clear internal policies regarding counterparty selection and
risk management (possibly in the form of a board resolution);

* only transact business with (a) authorised financial institutions (see
above) or (b) large sophisticated counterparties with a legitimate business
purpose; and

* transact business in an "appropriate" manner.

  These points are explained in further detail in the attached
advice.

We hope this helps to clarify the risks.  Please let us know if you need
additional information.

Best regards

Jeremy Pitts

This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd. We are gearing up to release 
the above referenced Product. 

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each 
of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5 
day, not less than 10 day:

Country: USA
Commodity: US Nat Gas
UoM:  MMBtu
Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible)

We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the 
website. The laymans description of the Product is as follows:

Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool 
Index.

Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery 
during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not 
less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than 
10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each such 
day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total 
300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.; Buyer 
chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer pays 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long 
delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should 
be entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as two 
different products. This is necessary in order to give us the protection 
against non-performance that the GTC's and master contracts support.

Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.

David:

Thanks for the note.

I think you have captured the questions. As to question 1, however, I would 
add that we are interested in an answer relating to on-line as well as phone 
trades. 

Mark, do you have anything to add?

We are looking forward to receiving your draft memo by the end of next week.  
I'll be in Japan next week, so if you have any questions, please foolow-up 
with Mark.

Thanks, Alan

		 Subject: Electronic Signatures


As we discussed, the following summarizes my understanding of the issues you 
would like us to analyze and address in a memo (recognizing that some of 
these issues cannot be definitively resolved at this point):

1.  After 10/1/00 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms completely, regardless 
of whether there is a master agreement in place with the counterparty, and 
instead advise counterparties of executed transactions through some type of 
notice (or perhaps just through a daily transaction summary) delivered 
through EOL?  If so, what (if anything) needs to be done to make this 
procedure effective (e.g., amendments to electronic trading agreement)?

2.  Before 10/1 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms if the applicable master 
agreement permits, or if there is no master, and provide notices through EOL 
in the manner described above?  What are the risks of relying on clicks 
evidencing a counterparty's transactions prior to the effectiveness of the 
legislation?

3.  When dealing with a non-US counterparty, what (in general terms) is the 
risk of following the procedures described above and not sending confirms?  
In other words, if the counterparty is in a jurisdiction that does not 
recognize electronic signatures as binding, is there a meaningful risk that 
the counterparty will be able to avoid transactions (recognizing that this 
question cannot be answered definitively without advice from local counsel 
and that we will only be able to provide general observations)?  How does the 
analysis change if the counterparty has signed a master agreement governed by 
NY law?

4.  Are confirms required for physical transactions, pursuant to Article 2 of 
the UCC?  If so, must they meet any specific requirements?

5.  Miscellaneous other issues -- Can tapes of phone trades suffice as 
electronic signatures under the federal legislation?  Is it sufficient for 
one party to have the ability to store and retrieve records of the 
transaction if the other party does not?

Please let me know if your understanding of the questions to be addressed 
differs from the foregoing.  Thanks.

David:

Yes, the UCC (Article 2) would be the basis for not requiring a signed 
confirmation from the counterparty receiving the confirmation if the physical 
product is a "good" under the UCC. This I think answers your second question 
also.

Thanks for sending the chart.  I will send you the list of questions we 
discussed tomorrow.  In the interim, I had a couple of questions on the 
chart:  On the first line (physical, no master), is the basis for not 
requriing the confirm to be signed the UCC?  Also, what is meant by "unless 
commodity not 'good'"?

Thanks.

Mark,

Please double check this format of the confirmation, remove the "draft" 
statement and make fully executable and initial for me before you go home 
tonight.

This will be used to go before Lavorato tomorrow morning.  Call me when your 
are ready and I will come by and pick it up.


Thanks for your help.

The Export1.doc file is the omnibus confirmation. I did not send the omnibus 
general terms and conditions.
If the confirmation will be on an ISDA format, the confirmation will be 
shorter, but this omnibus confirmation 
will give you the general idea of the transaction wording.

has indicated that we will shelve the summer 2000 product offering but that 
it is still desirable to offer the second product, minus its Summer 2000 
portion.  That is, the power desk would like to get up and running as soon as 
possible the same website and auction rules, offering Summer 2001-2002 
Capacity and Energy as the sole initial product.   Please either take a run 
at revising the website text to remove product one and the reference to 
Aug-Sept 2000 in product two, or send me the most recent revision so that I 
can make these deletions.  Additionally, feel free to call me with any 
questions.  --David.

David,

We have talked to our development team and we have concluded that we will not 
be able to have the auction site up and running before August 14th. As we 
have discussed previously, it usually takes around 3 to 4 weeks to develop an 
auction site. However, due to the various projects that our developers are 
working on this timeline has been extended.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Subject: EOL -- Mexican tax consequences

This e-mail sets forth the Mexican tax consequences arising from Enron North 
America Corp. (or any other United States entity that is wholly-owned by 
Enron Corp. and does not have nexus in Mexico) ("ENA") entering into any of 
the sixteen financial derivative transactions described in the "Hedging 
Indexes definitions" tab contained in the attachment below ("Transactions") 
with Mexican counterparties through EnronOnline ("EOL").  (The Transactions 
are those that Jaime Williams has indicated are most likely to be entered 
into with Mexican counterparties.  Although such counterparties may enter 
into any of the Transactions, they may also transact through EOL with respect 
to any other product offered.  I will follow up as soon as possible regarding 
the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products not addressed in 
this e-mail.)

Based on advice received from Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C. (our 
Mexican tax counsel based in Mexico City), payments made by a Mexican 
counterparty to ENA pursuant to any of the Transactions will not be subject 
to Mexican income, withholding or value-added tax.  Consequently, the 
Transactions (described in the attachment below) are approved by the ENA Tax 
Department for trading through EnronOnline with Mexican counterparties.

Jaime and Agustin:  Please keep in mind that our previous discussions 
regarding ENA's activities  in Mexico (i.e., that its activities in Mexico 
should continue to be limited such that it is not subject to Mexican tax) 
also apply to ENA's EOL transactions with Mexican counterparties.  Thus, 
Enron employees' activities in Mexico on behalf of ENA (or any other 
non-Mexican Enron entity), whether through EOL transactions or otherwise, 
should be limited to general marketing of Enron products; no negotiations 
regarding any product should take place in Mexico on behalf of ENA, and no 
contract should be executed in Mexico on behalf of ENA.

Please contact me at 713.853.5777 with any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Subject: EOL list

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

Michael + Paul-

Thought you might be interested in Alfred as a possible contact for insights 
on regulatory activities.  I'll ask Richard Sage to record him as a contact 
on our sheet.

Esther-

Please action somebody to follow thru on the cost saving opportunity (clear 
all NYMEX energy trades).  Jeff Shankman is the logical port of call in 
Houston to run this through.  Please advise me of the findings and 
conclusions.

Eric,

I want to thank you again for returning my call.

To summarize, I received a memo from Tom McKeever concerning individuals in
the organization who have been identified as key or secondary role in
certain function areas. I noticed that there is no US contact on the list.
I would have no problem in you adding my name to the list since I run the
Regulatory Firm of MG London Inc. USA a registered FCM and CTA.

Note: We can clear all Enron's NYMEX energy trades. It is my understanding
that you presently clear through ten
              different brokers. Maybe we can save some $$$$.  Call me if
you have any interest.  212 715 5845.

Ted,

Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in 
detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of 
the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment 
policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk 
management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price 
volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."

Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there 
any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that 
language?

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick

This is a fairly aggressive schedule for meetings.  I am not sure that we 
will have any updates of worth every three days.  I think Andrea should be 
taken off of all work other than EOL and gas and electricity sales until EOL 
is online if this is the kind of pressure Mike wants to put on this issue.  
As it is Andrea does not have a lot of time to devote to this issue.  What is 
your suggestion?

Dear Derivatives Week subscriber: 

Catch the latest breaking news in this week's issue by clicking 
here: http://www.derivativesweek.com 

Top stories this week: 
___________________________________________________________ 
Shell Trading is investigating trading credit default swaps for the first 
time 
as a cheaper alternative to letters of credit and to generate additional 
revenue. 

Korea's Asiana Airlines, with anticipated revenue of KRW2,100 billion 
(USD1.9 billion), hopes this year to return to the interest-rate swaps market 
to hedge some 45% of its USD1.4 billion foreign currency-denominated floating 
rate loan portfolio. 

Five months after launching a bankruptcy swaps market making business 
Enron has only traded a handful of contracts with end users and has yet to 
pull the trigger on a deal with a financial institution. 

Foreign banks were seen late last month scrambling to cover short 
interest-rate 
option volatility positions after a sharp spike in Japanese swaption 
volatility. The 
banks, thought to include J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank, were seen buying 
swaption vol on the way up and selling vol as the market traded down.

This is a wrap-up email to inform all of you about the dates, activities and 
where we are standing with regards to the expansion of EOL to the Mexican 
Market.   The general strategy is to target the 40 major key customers 
directly, through two  formal presentations. One on Thursday August 3rd in 
Monterrey, at the  Quinta Real Hotel; and the second one on Friday August 4th 
in Mexico City, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   The setting is pretty much a 
Continental breakfast, followed by welcoming remarks and the formal 
presentation of EOL.

We plan to send out the invitations with the brochures around July 15th.  Kal 
Shah is planning on delivering around 600 spanish-translated EOL Ball 
Brochures in the next days. The brochures will have a cover letter that will 
include the Guest Accounts for the customers that will be invited to the 
formal presentations. We will follow up with RSVP personal calls from the 
15th to the 3rd. The rest of the customers will receive the brochure by mail. 

Jeff Blumenthal is helping us on the Tax Issues regarding on-line 
transactions by Mexican Counterparties. Jeff is almost finishing on checking 
the Tax implications on the products most probably traded by the targeted 
customers, as well as all other products listed on EOL. 

Carol St Claire is helping us on all the legal issues, as well as reviewing 
the marketing material that would be sent out to customers. We should have a 
formal opinion in the next days. 

Eric Thode is putting together the press releases to be sent on the launching 
date, and is also helping us with a plan to invite and inform the media about 
the event as well as EOL service. Eric, please send a copy of the press 
releases to Carol, since there are some words we need to avoid on the legal 
side of things.

Paul Radous and Rod Nelson are helping us with the pre-approval of credit for 
all of these targeted customers to be able to transact in EOL.

Mark - Following is the ICIS LOR Pricing Language for Methanol provided to us 
by DC&D.

The arithmetic average of the mean of the high and low prices as quoted
in ICIS-LOR Group LTD's Methanol Price Report in the section under 
Methanol (US Gulf) Contract Prices (FOB) - "Barge" (cts/gal) 
effective each day in the Delivery month for which such prices are
quoted (rounded to four (4) decimal places).

If the Contract Price for Methanol is no longer quoted by ICIS-LOR in
exactly the same format  as on the date hereof, then the parties will 
negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative price index
representing the Contract price of Methanol.

Thanks.
Nony

Mark, I've reviewed the latest version of our ISDA forms, and I'd like an 
opportunity to learn by doing if you think that's O.K.  Do you think I could 
get involved in an upcoming Master Agreement, subject, of course, to your

Bob,

I have finished my review of the EOL GTC's in light of the desk's desire to 
offer DW48 online.  I will forward the revised GTC's to you shortly (FYI - we 
have revised the GTC's to contemplate DW48 and have also taken the 
opportunity to make a few clean-up edits that we've been holding until we had 
the opportunity to modify the GTC's). 

 I would prefer to continue to refer to the Pooling Points as "Market Pooling 
Points" as that is what is contemplated by the GTC's and it is consistent 
with our Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement and other Master 
Bandwidth Documentation.  If there is an uproar about this, I can revise the 
GTC's accordingly - otherwise, please use the "Long Descriptions" that Jeff 
Blumenthal prepared as he wrote them.  

I have confirmed with the regulatory group that we don't have regulatory 
issues with this product as EOL is not available to the general public.  We 
have slightly revised the attachment below (BQOS DW48) so that it comports 
with the GTC's - it will be attached to the GTC's that I send you as Annex 
A-4. 

 Please call with any other questions or comments!  All the best!

Cynthia

DW-48 Phy Fwd

Cynthia - 
I am a member of the EOL Product Control (Documentation) team requesting your 
review and advice regarding the set-up of a new Product Type (Bandwidth 
DW-48) to be traded by Richard Schneider.  He has expressed great urgency in 
setting up this product quickly for trading online and your assistance is 
most appreciated.  

The memo (further below this e-mail) relates to the Product Type description 
for Bandwidth DW-48.  It is identical to those descriptions for Bandwidth 
DS-3, OC-3, and OC3c, which are currently online with the exception of that 
which is highlighted in red.  If it meets with your approval, please advise 
Mark Taylor so that he may approve it in the EOL system.
Richard Schneider has forwarded a QoS attachment for DW-48 to add to the 
GTC's.  Please advise if it meet with your approval.  If it does, please 
provide us with the GTC's inclusive of the QoS for DW-48.   
In addition, there are 13 paired city locations that need to be created in 
EOL for the existing product types and the DW-48.  Currently there is only 
one location description and it is for the New York - Los Angeles paired 
cities.  It reads as follows:  

 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling 
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX:  212-462, 
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th 
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX:  213-362,  CLLI: 
LSAJCAWZH04),  for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.

The 13 paired cities utilize the same description parameters.  However, 
Richard has requested that the location descriptions for the 13 paired cities 
be revised by deleting "Market" and replacing it with "Enron."   The 
following example references that change; please advise if this meets with 
your approval:  

 The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the Seattle Enron Pooling 
Point (2001 6th Ave., Eleventh Floor, Suite 1150, Seattle, WA 98121,  
NPA-NXX: 206-770, CLLI: STTLWAWBH78) and the Portland Enron Pooling Point 
(827 NE Oregon St., Suite 100, Portland, Oregon 97232,   NPA-NXX: 503-232, 
CLLI: PTLDORTIH04) for a total of 147 DSO miles.

Please call me at extension 35491 as I am available to discuss this in 
person.  Thank you!

Your review of the following product in the EOL Datamanager under Product

DSO's per DW-48 is 32,256.  The price shall be as submitted by the 
Counterparty via the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or 
sell Bandwidth Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to

a party may incur costs and expenses and may additionally be required to 
execute certain documentation.

Please see the attached chart.  My understanding is that you are going to 
send to Mark and me tomorrow an outline of the questions that will be 
answered in the memorandum. We will give you any refinements after our 
review. We would like to have a draft of the memo by the end of next week.

EPMI recently did a deal with the City of Vernon which was a little bit funky 
and the sensitive, high strung city got somewhat out of sorts about the way 
we insisted upon documenting the deal and bitched to our trader (Rosman) 
about it, who, in turn, having a bad karma day, as usual, came in and bitched 
to me about it.  After some hearty belly-laughing at his expense flowing from 
the rich comedic theme of how we talk so sweet to our customers on the phone 
and then hang up and curse their mortal souls with expletives deleted,    I  
agreed with him that we need to ask the following question to those above 
with more wisdom than we have:

When you do the physical leg of an EFP transaction,  must the delivery point 
for the physical piece be identical to the delivery point of the futures 
piece?  

Shooting from the hip on the Casino floor without much substantive 
explanation to go on, I said the answer to this question was absolutely yes 
and the City of Vernon huffed and puffed and said they had done other deals 
where the delivery points were different.

I made us document the deal as follows:

1. An undocumented Nymex transaction whereby our broker agreed with their 
broker that we would buy 30 Palo Verde futures contracts from Vernon for $120.

2. Then, the Exchange of this futures position for a physical position was 
documented as a physical trade whereby EPMI sold Vernon 30 MW at Palo Verde 
for $120.

3. Then, because Vernon wanted to get out of their Palo Verde position, we 
agreed to buy back the 30 Mw for $120 and this was documented as a phsical 
transaction.

4.  Then, because Vernon needed the power at NP-15, we sold them 30 MW at 
NP-15 for $116. (Don't get distracted by thinking about buying at $120 and 
selling at $116 and losing money. The prices were good at both points as part 
of our portfolio of deals.)  

Vernon said we should have done step 1 and step 4 and not 2 and 3 and that 
they do this all the time.  I basically said that if the delivery point in 
the NYMEX contract was PV that it had to be the same in the physical part of 
the EFP.   May we please have the benefit of any comments on this issue.  
Thank you kindly.----cgy

As we discussed, the following summarizes my understanding of the issues you 
would like us to analyze and address in a memo (recognizing that some of 
these issues cannot be definitively resolved at this point):

1.  After 10/1/00 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms completely, regardless 
of whether there is a master agreement in place with the counterparty, and 
instead advise counterparties of executed transactions through some type of 
notice (or perhaps just through a daily transaction summary) delivered 
through EOL?  If so, what (if anything) needs to be done to make this 
procedure effective (e.g., amendments to electronic trading agreement)?

2.  Before 10/1 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms if the applicable master 
agreement permits, or if there is no master, and provide notices through EOL 
in the manner described above?  What are the risks of relying on clicks 
evidencing a counterparty's transactions prior to the effectiveness of the 
legislation?

3.  When dealing with a non-US counterparty, what (in general terms) is the 
risk of following the procedures described above and not sending confirms?  
In other words, if the counterparty is in a jurisdiction that does not 
recognize electronic signatures as binding, is there a meaningful risk that 
the counterparty will be able to avoid transactions (recognizing that this 
question cannot be answered definitively without advice from local counsel 
and that we will only be able to provide general observations)?  How does the 
analysis change if the counterparty has signed a master agreement governed by 
NY law?

4.  Are confirms required for physical transactions, pursuant to Article 2 of 
the UCC?  If so, must they meet any specific requirements?

5.  Miscellaneous other issues -- Can tapes of phone trades suffice as 
electronic signatures under the federal legislation?  Is it sufficient for 
one party to have the ability to store and retrieve records of the 
transaction if the other party does not?

Please let me know if your understanding of the questions to be addressed 
differs from the foregoing.  Thanks.

We need to ensure that any Brokers (TrueQuote's own included) have no access 
to transactions entered into by Enron with other counterparties.  Also no 
access to the information behind the prices that isn't available to others 
using the website (ie stacks etc).  This would also apply to all of the 
others in fact I don't think we have restricted this in terms of the price/ 
volume information available to other equity players in the site.

Joya,
Here's a break down of the Wooden Private Office "E" station (Cherry Wood) 
vs. the Laminate Private Office "E" station (Off white laminate). All quotes 
are approximate and based on reusing our existing inventory, if available. 
Lead-time for both is approximately 3-5 weeks based on quantities.

Wooden Private Office "E" Station = $2100. each

Laminate Private Office "E" Station = $750. each

Feel free to call me if there are questions.

Thanks,
Reggie

Dave:
I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the 
online issues that we have asked them to address in the next day or so as I 
spoke with them yesterday about this.  I will need to review the memo with 
them and Mark Taylor to make sure that all of the issues have been adequately 
addressed and to determine if any changes need to be made to the documents.  
>From my conversations with them, there don't appear to be any major issues 
other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican 
counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be 
considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before 
we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.

No, if it is an approved customer that Enron would otherwise talk to over the 
phone.  We always have to be careful about assuming advisory/fiduciary 
duties, as would be the case in telephone communications.  I got your voice 
mail on the direct access issues; let's try to talk some time on Wednesday.  
Thanks.

Mark,

I seem to recall from our earlier conversation that London can trade on the 
PULPEX but cannot trade as a marketmaker.  That can only be done out of 
Houston.  Is this understanding correct? and if so, why is that?  The reason 
why I ask is that eventually we would like to move the marketmaking function 
over to London.

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.


All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my 
directory under specproj/online.

I would like to add some questions to the ones Dave has raised below.

1.  Would it make a difference if we were transacting Metals in a separate 
web site from EOL?   I would see this as EnronMetals (the new name for MG) 
running there own site issuing their own products.  I think we would need 
this because we would be unable have an EnronOnline entity issuing LME 
contracts with a sleeving arrangement to EnronMetals/MG.  My understanding is 
that only a registered entity can issue LME Contracts.

2.  If we had to go to the separate site to address this issue, how would we 
handle the links to EOL?  I assume people on EnronMetals could not trade 
other products (ngas) on EnronMetals site.  Could we have a click through?  
Would they have to sign in again?

Subject: MG

As you know, we are looking at doing the following with MG:

1) Moving the Market Maker Application into EnronOnline - effectively, by 
putting the same products on EnronOnline as are currently on Market Maker, 
then shutting down Market Maker and putting a hyperlink in to EnronOnline

2) Launching financial metals products on EnronOnline, which would transacted 
by MG.


I have some concerns about both of these activities.


(1) Until today, I did not realise that the Market Maker application actually 
involves the transaction of an LME contract. In other words, when a customer 
buys from MG on the Market Maker app, they are buying LME contracts. We have 
taken pains to distinguish between what we do on EnronOnline - which is to 
transact on products which might settle against a published price vs. 
transacting on the actual exchange contract.  As you know, Exchange contracts 
are subject to a different set of regulations and scrutiny than currently 
applies to EnronOnline.


(2) Because MG trades Exchange contracts on the floor of the exchange, they 
are subject to more stringent regulations than Enron. I am concerned that if 
MG is transacting financial products on EnronOnline, that EnronOnline could 
come under greater scrutiny by the SFA. Paul: Can you comment on whether or 
not this is a risk?  If this is a risk, would it be mitigated by having 
another Enron company handle EnronOnline transactions (with sleeving back to 
MG), or are we already sunk by virtue of the fact that MG is now in the Enron 
family?

Comments from any/all recipients invited . . .

Thanks,

Dave

I have learned that the time stamp is not our own but Reuters--so it is the 
time of the last trade.  I assume, then, that it's okay to give people that 
additional information as long as we have the quotes delayed by 20 minutes 
disclaimer?

Everybody

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Trena

Mark - As per Harry's request, I'm forwarding you the ICIS LOR Pricing 
Language for Methanol online trading:

The arithmetic average of the mean of the high and low prices as quoted
in ICIS-LOR Group LTD's Methanol Price Report in the section under 
Methanol (US Gulf) Contract Prices (FOB) - "Barge" (cts/gal) 
effective each day in the Delivery month for which such prices are
quoted (rounded to four (4) decimal places).

If the Contract Price for Methanol is no longer quoted by ICIS-LOR in
exactly the same format  as on the date hereof, then the parties will 
negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative price index
representing the Contract price of Methanol.

Thanks.

The Weather desk will be offering a Power Financial Product. Besides the fact 
that this Power Product will be managed by the Weather Desk, it is different 
in that it more closely mirrors a Weather transaction, as Weather trading 
will be adjusting the 'Strike Prices' (as opposed to the proces) for these 
power transactions through the Bid and Offer. The Pay Unit is set at 10/MW 
and the Floating Price will equal PJM Demand prices on the PJMs official 
website. The Payment Amount will equal the product of the Notional and the 
ABS of Floating Price - Strike Price.

Please see the Product Long Description attached.

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor

Currency: USD
Country: US
Commodity: Weather/Power Demand
UoM:  MWh

Initally, this Product will only be traded internally. It will not be booked 
into Enpower, and since it is traded book-to-book it will not be Confirmed.

If this is becoming a serious issue we may want to get a quick meeting 
together to determine a plan for resolving it. Based on Ron's analysis below, 
it sounds like we need a determination if we can legally use another form of 
technology for the confirm for high volume partners. 

Email would be easiest to implement (perhaps with digital signatures that 
were recently approved as legally binding by the courts) in the near term. 
This, of course, will have to be prioritized against competing needs in the

Subject: Faxing

Jeff,

In response to Jennifer and your inquiry, I looked at fax requests that 
failed since June 28th.  I did some spot checking and
in lieu of doing an intense study, I came to the following conclusions.

1) Many requests fail ( No dial tone, No answer at Destination, cannot 
identify remote unit, etc. ) because the fax machine is
 inoperable.  I dialed the same numbers at 4:30 p.m. and got a valid fax dial 
tone.  The requests that failed for these
 reasons occurred at night, early morning, or on weekends.

2) A bunch fail because "Number dialed was busy", this implies someone else 
was hitting their fax machine - we tried six times
 and gave up.

3) A bunch failed do to "Unexpected Disconnect".  This means that our machine 
was talking to their machine and before
 out machine got back positive acknowledgment that the fax was received, 
communication ended for some reason.

4) A number failed do to "Image Sub-system failed to render cover page",  
This can be looked into and possibly resolved.


We are processing up to 2,000 fax requests per day.  A high percentage fail 
when faxed at night, early morning, and weekends or do
to failure inherent in the faxing technology.  If we attempt to fax during 
business hours, a fairly significant percentage of failures
will shift from item (1) to item (2), especially for high volume trading 
parties.

I agree with others in looking at other solutions;  (1)  not faxing deals 
done through EOL, (2) finding a more efficient method of communicating
deals to high volume trading partners.  This could include  E-mail to begin 
with and evolve into Internet access and/or server to server communication.

It appears we are reaching the limit with the faxing technology.  Even if we 
could shove more paper through - can the party on the other end
handle the volume - or do they just ignore it?

Thanks, Ron

Here is a managers' amendment that Chairman Leach of the Banking Committee
is considering.  I would imagine that section 10 would be of particular
interest to Enron, given that it provides unconditional legal certainty for
all wholesale, individually negotiated derivatives.  This provision may
prove controversial, and there is little time between now and our Thursday
markup.

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

Can you commence the process for ETA's and PA's for Bermuda?

Please advise as to how long you think this may take - and if the cost to us 
is likely to exceed $US 22,000

Subject: eSpeak Survey: The results are in!


We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

Because of the issue Andrea raises in the email below I think it would be a 
good idea for you to meet with Mike.  I also think Andrea should participate 
by phone since she is most familiar with the CNV and other legal issues that 
will impact EOL trading in Argentina.

To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I fully understand the purpose of their 
trip.  Mike seems to want to be able to carry out financial transactions on 
shore (through and Enron Argentine vehicle and with Argentine CPs) through 
EOL.  Although there are probably other issues on their agenda, I'm sure they 
will want to meet with Lynn to specifically discuss this matter.  I am 
currently preparing a legal memo on the current status of the bill that would 
amend the bankruptcy law.  I will give you an update just in case you decide 
to join them for the meeting.

As you know, the ETA has to address Trade one-to-many with Enron and Match 
one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a separate Trade GTC one-to-many with 
Enron and Separate Match GTC one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a single 
Password application that addresses Match and Trade, both one-to-many.

As soon as these drafts are complete, I would like to read them!

Thanks.

Subject: Electronic Transactions Agreement - revised

Attached is a revised version of the ETA omitting the distinction between 
transactions on Match and transactions on Trade.   If Enron is the only party 
permitted to post product on Match, there is no need for the special rules 
that we drafted for what was previously a "many-to-many" matching site.  
However, we will need to develop a different set of GTCs for transactions 
that Enron closes on Match, since the products transacted on Match are not 
likely to be the type that lend themselves to Enron's standard GTCs.

Mary,

Set forth below are the provisions that should be included in a margin 
agreement whereby ENA will borrow funds from a non-U.S. entity (i.e., ABN 
AMRO) and make payments of principal and interest pursuant to the borrowing.  
As you'll note, the language provides that ENA will only be required to make 
(and be liable for) payments of interest that are net of any U.S. withholding 
tax and, thus, ABN AMRO will bear the burden of any U.S. withholding tax.


All payments under this Agreement shall be made without any deduction or 
withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding 
is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any 
relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect.  If a party is so 
required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") shall (a) pay to the 
relevant authorities the full amount required to be withheld promptly upon 
the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or 
receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y, (b) pay and be 
liable to Y for only the net amount owed after reduction for any Tax, and (c) 
promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a copy thereof), or other 
documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such 
authorities.

"Tax" means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment 
or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties, and additions thereto) 
that is imposed by any government or other taxing authority in respect of any 
payment under this Agreement.

Please contact me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards,

Jeff
