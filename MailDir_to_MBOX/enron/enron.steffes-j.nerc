Its my turn, sorry I havent jumped in til now, computer problems.

At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug 9, the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat do=
wn and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would=
 tackle the tough issues at NERC.

I beleive the EPSA folks in the room, Mirant, Dynegy, Ontario Power Gen, En=
ron, Exelon, Calpine  and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organizat=
ion setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability=
 and commercial issues can be sleanly separated.  We came away from the mee=
ting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mech=
anism to resolve this age old debate - I don't care what kind of standard y=
ou call it - if you write it - it must be put through the GISB/EISB wringer=
.  GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given =
a segment in the energy quadrant.
=20
Also to respond to Sarah's note about support for an SRO - no entity in the=
 room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization - no=
t NERC, NAERO, GISB or RTOs.  So I think we need to hold tight to this issu=
e and we will be able to rally support for it.

I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed, Aug 15 at DOE.  I am working =
with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants=
 from the EISB Strawman.

I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I=
 will make on behalf of EPSA.

Please proviede me your thoughts.

Also - I agree with Dick, today, NERC is 12.5 million dollars annually, and=
 mostly utility dollars.  If we are going to push for a EISB, we have to pr=
ovide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this.  NERC (=
and their supporters) will fall on their sword on funding and the reult wil=
l be we have 2 organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to beco=
me a part of the EISB process. =20

And one more thing, I don't know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he=
 has to the Independent Baord members, many of which he helped get seated. =
 But pushing for EISB and perhaps wrapping NERC into it as the reliability =
piece (GISB's suggestion) - may render the Independents obsolete.  I don't =
know if are wedded to them.

I agree with Steve although I've articulated a different point of view at t=

Subject:=09RE: FTC / NERC - Comment of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics=
 and of Policy Planning of the Federal Trade Commission.

After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of=
 the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser=
vice.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=
les will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=
s performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=
 against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =
ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=
ize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =
the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =
The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=
r their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=
s would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=
dity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=
ed to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=
e expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=
 is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=
 Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=
e industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=
 complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=
oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=
 service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=
 most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=
e rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=
 Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=
ished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=
c.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=
corporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=
d incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=
s or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =
can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=
ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=
ot see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =
they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =
the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =
regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have tr=
ansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20

=09=09Subject:=09Update - NERC Version of Legislation

=09=09Rick

=09=09The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NER=
C activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly EN=
RON-NERC team conference call.

=09=09John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length o=
f its proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM appro=
ach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to =
push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislatio=
n. =20

=09=09Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook a=
nd Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NE=
RC stakeholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request =
to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of de=
ference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting =
Organization - SSO).

=09=09The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to pr=
esent issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q And=
erson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discus=
sions with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position =
of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language=
 that defers to the SSO out of the legislation. =20

=09=09Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if=
 Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not throug=
h legislation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good j=
ob.  By knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satis=
fied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no=
 industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

=09=09I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to re=
solve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
=09=09Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples=
 of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules t=
hat all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be p=
owerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authorit=
y in the legislation. =20

=09=09We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation princi=
ples with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

Andy

This Wednesday, the 25th, I would like to get you, Mike and I together and talk with Dick Ingersoll on the procedure that MISO will propose on Source Sink reservation requirements.

We need to be sure what the Enron position is for purposes of the RTO settlements.  

The concern that I am hearing from Dick is that Enron should not be supporting any process which requires disclosure of ultimate source or sink until time of scheduling.  From what I understand of the solution MISO proposes, there will be at least one leg with a "fixed" source and sink to be disclosed at time of reservation in order for a request to be approved.  Transmission redirect after approval and confirmation of this "fixed" leg could be a plausible solution - but I understand this won't be in place initially.

Dick, please let me know how to contact you on Wed and at what times.

Thank you all.

Thursday morning, August 2nd, Jeff Skilling held a conference call with John Q Anderson, one of 9 independent Board members of NERC, to discuss Enron's position on the NERC version of reliability legislation.  Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes were present on the call.

John Anderson's purpose for the call with Jeff was to find out what Enron wanted to see in legislation in order for Enron to give deference to NERC to become a Self-Regulated Organization for setting reliability standards.

Jeff explained that the PJM version has a more likeable approach than the NERC version, PJM's is less prescriptive and relies more on FERC participation in establishing a "SRO".  Additionally, funding concerns are not addressed in either version and a viable funding mechanism that does not rely on Regional Councils is needed.

Jeff also would like to make a presentation (as soon as possible) to the NERC Board of Trustees of the key items Enron would like to see resolved that would provide Enron enough confidence that the NERC/NAERO organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity.  

I will be working with the Enron-NERC team on a breifing paper of what we want NERC to fix in current NERC rules and processes for NERC to demonstrate it is worthy of the "SRO" status.  Some example issues include:
1) Indpendence requirements for operators and Security Coordinators
2) competitive advantages of control areas - parking and hubbing
3) competitive advantages of native and network service - source and sink data requirements

Mark

Here is a document Enron has prepared that describes what we want to see in a wholesale electric Standards Setting Organization (SSO).

I hope you will be able to consider these points for the letter you will be drafting from EPSA to the NERC Board of Trustees. 

Please do not distribute this until Jose Bestard, as member of the Stakeholder Committee, has had an opportunity to convey this to Mike Gent.

Thanks
Charles

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group
       Legislative Affairs Committee

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Scott Weiner, Legislative Affairs Committee Chair
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs

DATE: August 16, 2001

RE: Reliability Legislation

We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August 20th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation.

Reliability Legislation

S. 2071

S. 2071, sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), was approved by the Senate in the last Congress.  The House of Representatives did not act on the bill.  S. 2071 represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber.

This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization (ERO) with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards.

FERC would have primary jurisdiction over:

? the electric reliability organization (ERO);

? all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority would
  be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards);

? all system operators; and

? all users of the bulk-power system.

The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards. It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards.

What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities.  The bill would:

? Allow the ERO, subject to FERC approval, to delegate authority to a
  requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with
  standards.

? Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to "ensure
  the safety, adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state."

? Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same,
  although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure
  enforcement of standards.

A similar bill - H.R. 2602 - was introduced in the House last session by Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD). No action was taken on this bill.  The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).

Other Developments

Last year, in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation, a number of groups headed by NERC, sent a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation.  The letter is attached.  A number of groups, including public power groups, the California ISO, Edison Electric Institute, NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter.

EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort.  However, we did not sign the letter.  While we stated that we did not oppose the letter, EPSA's position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation.

Last month, a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders.  Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep. Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language.  In addition to EPSA, other groups in attendance included NARUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, Entergy, PJM , Public Power Groups, Consumer Groups, ELCON, Mirant and Enron.  The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed.  The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language.  Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill.  Still, a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version.

PJM Proposal

PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language.  The 4-page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC.  If you would like a copy faxed to you, please contact Michael Reddy (mreddy@epsa.org) at EPSA.  Additionally, FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction.  FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system.

Some concerns over the PJM language include:

? Formation of regional entities that would be a "bottoms up" organization.
  These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs.

? Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus
  standards

? The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground.

Revised NERC language

Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language.  Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill, the new language was shortened to 16 pages.  The red-lined version is attached.  Among the noteworthy changes:

? p. 6, applications for approval to become the ERO, strikes language to
  specify funding mechanisms and requirements.

? p. 13, changes in filings of funding and funding procedures, language
  deleted on specifics on changes to funding.

? p. 21, additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC
  will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or
  transmission if it determines a need.

? p. 22, language on coordination with RTOs deleted.

Status and Prospects of Legislation

The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA).   Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess.  It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability.

The Senate, with its recent switch in control, remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation.  In its present version, Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman's bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill.  Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall.

Regulatory/NERC/GISB Developments

While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain, NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO.  When first envisioned several years ago, the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a self-regulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards.  Legislative delays, however, led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition, beginning with its governance structure.

Last February, the 38 member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members.  Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role, in addition to authority to participate in funding, board member changes and a few other general matters.  Also, the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils.  Funding for NERC, presently administered by the regions, remains an extremely problematic, open question, as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure.

The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB) has provided an alternative that didn't exist at the time the NAERO concept, and related legislative effort, began.  The EISB model, which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards, initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early 2000, has gained substantial momentum.

During FERC's June 19th technical conference on Function 8 and interregional coordination, the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today.  In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August 13th, Commissioners Massey, Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it.  Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) on August 14 - 15th, further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal.

Meanwhile, the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERC's reform effort, as well as the reliability legislation.  A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more "open and inclusive," including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current 50/50 (transmission provider/transmission customer) to a sector approach.  The NERC board may receive those recommendations, and other possible NERC reforms, including a new Organization Standards Process, when it meets in October.

The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September 19th.  There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal.  Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board, and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant.

Additionally, the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop.  The emergence of a new EISB, if it occurs, could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERC/NAERO will be the only standard setting organization.  Granting a new NAERO authority over "reliability" will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities, and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid.

Attached are suggested comments on the draft NERC bill for which we were asked to provide comments by today.  You will see that the response is a firm, but polite -- no thanks.  While I doubt NERC assumes that silence means support by their deadline today, I would like to get something to them by COB if at all possible.  (I will be on vacation tomorrow in any event).  With apologies for the short turn around, please call or e-mail your comments or OK this afternoon.

NERC's Control Area Criteria Task Force (CACTF) paper on the Reliability Model "unbundles" definitionally the functions of a control area.  Today's control area is required under NERC policy to meet many reliability requirements for short-term, daily and real-time operations.   NERC CACTF identified 4 major areas of function:

1) Security Authority 
Performs short term security analysis for interchange schedules (between control areas)
Administers curtailment procedures (NERC TLR)

2) Interchange Authority
Responsible for maintaining a net of interchange schedules that balance at control area interfaces in real-time

3) Balancing Authority
Provides real-time dispatch to match energy demand and supply
Maintains performance measures such as frequency, and voltage requirements
Maintains accounting balance sheets for inadvertent energy between control areas

4) Transmission Service Provider
Offers transmission access through a tariff
Calculates ATC/TTC and other transfer capability amounts
Responsible for accounting line losses

5) Market Participants
Includes Purchasing Selling Entities, Generators, and Load Serving Entities

It is important to remember that the NERC CACTF Relibility Model describes only FUNCTIONs and does not attempt to restructure a vertically integrated control area that may perform any and all of these functions.

The CACTF developed these concepts and explored how to provide comparability and eliminate competitive advantages of control areas.  This entailed specifiying indpendence requirements on certain functions.  Unfortunately, in order to eliminate the competitive advantages, transmission companies (particularly SERC members and small municipalities) successfully argued that NERC lacked the authority to order or mandate restructuring of organizations to accomodate the CACTF model and its independence requirements.  

It is Enron's position at NERC that the Security Authority, Transmission Service Provider, and the Balancing Authoirity must be divorced of the market participants - i.e. - "independence".  Today, Enron and other entities have obtained certain control area advantages through formation of control areas to specifically obtain the abilities provided under the Interchange Authority.  It was the attempt of the CACTF to unbundle the control area such that all market participants had comparable access to the Interchange Authority advantages.

The Grid South problem:
Their current proposal is to have the RTO perform the Interchange Authority function.  For tags (PTP service) that are submitted that utilize the Grid South tariff, GridSouth will approve and clear those tags for scheduling.  However, the 3 existing control areas would continue to perform the control area functions for its own transactions and native load schedules (inadvertent accounting, balancing, and performance criteria CPS, remains in the control areas).  In other words, the proposal only delegates the bare minimum of control area functions to the GridSouth operator, those needed to administer the tariff for PTP service customers.  Except for the Secuirty Authority functions which will be performed by GridSouth, the operational advantages of control areas, will remain at the transmission company level. 

FERC must mandate the independence requirements and  force GridSouth members to restructure to remove all competitive advantages.

I spoke with Phil Marsten on the phone to get more information as to the pu=
rpose of CAEM and its supporters.
As you know, Enron's attempt at implementation of these technologies a coup=
le of years ago (Randy Maffett's group) hit upon many obstacles, mostly res=
istance or reluctance by utilities to allow or sponsor such projects.
=20
There is some value to the CAEM approach - that is to help the vendors/prop=
rietors of the technology by educating regulators and policy makers to the =
value of these solutions.
=20
Presently, Phil is talking with some transmission companies - but none of t=
he major problem area names were mentioned.
=20
Phase I - evaluating technology, get a common understanding of these system=
s, technically THEN - analysis into the regulatory impacts
- includes hiring experts to evaluate the technologies, cost, commercialabi=
lity, etc.
=20
A CERTS (DOE) effort was technology focused, not focused on the policy side=
. I asked Phil if he was aware of any similar efforts at EPRI, EEI or IEEE =
to see if there is any duplication.  He did not know.  I will ask someone t=
o research whether these organizations are trying the same.  If they are, t=
hen there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
=20
Phil mentioned that Rob Bradley has information on funding this effort that=
 may allow Enron participation without financial contribution.
=20
I left it open to invite Phil to meet with Enron folks if we are interested=
 in joining. =20
=20
In my opinion, RTOs will ultimately have to be on board from both a plannin=
g and operational perspective to implement these solutions.  Policy makers =
are certainly important - but RTO endorsement can be just as effective of a=
 catalyst for implementing these solutions.  Regulators tend to defer to th=
e technical experts. So, would CAEM be effective or needed on the RTO front=
?  Also in Steve Walton's opinion, much more ATC and TTC is left off the ta=
ble than what these technologies may be able to offer, so you can get more =
bang for the buck by pushing for better NERC rules, curbing regional counci=
l authority, getting more FERC action, etc.  CAEM technologies could become=
 a crutch for a bad-boy utility to not doing what is right in the first pla=
ce.  We would not want a regulator to lose sight of the real problems at ha=
nd today.=20

Dear Steve:=20
=20
I'm wearing a somewhat different hat today, that of "Adjunct Scholar" to Ke=
n Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM).  In that ca=
pacity, I am directing the Center's recently announced Grid Enhancement Eva=
luation Project.  The full proposal is attached below as a PDF file. I've a=
lso included for your records an updated resume on my qualifications to dir=
ect the Project.     =20
=20
You know better than any in the industry how the restructuring of the Natio=
n's electricity markets and regulatory infrastructure is continuing in the =
face of greater uncertainty than at any time since the oil price shocks of =
the 1970s.  And as one of the major participants in the business as well as=
 the policy debate over the future shape of the generation and transmission=
 industries, Enron is also well aware that a key component of any regulator=
y outcome will be efforts to enhance the performance of the transmission gr=
id.   The purpose of CAEM's Grid Enhancement Evaluation Project is therefor=
e to provide an independent assessment of the new grid debottlenecking and =
flow control and management technologies to provide the public - and policy=
makers - with a better understanding of how these new systems operate, what=
 they will cost, how they may be deployed, and, in particular, how these po=
tentially disruptive technologies will "synch" with the currently evolving =
regulatory framework.  This effort should be especially timely in light of =
the concern over the extent to which the current changes in the regulatory =
framework are really being created to address problems resulting from the c=
razy-quilt legacy transmission system, and may tend to institutionalize som=
e aspects of those legacy systems.      =20
=20
The Center is proposing to bring together a blue-ribbon panel to evaluate o=
pportunities for enhancing the nation's electric transmission grid through =
the use of various new technologies, including in particular solid-state po=
wer electronics-based solutions ("FACTS" technologies), high voltage direct=
 current ("HVDC")  interconnectors across "seams" in the regional grids, an=
d superconducting-based technologies.  The Grid Enhancement Evaluation Proj=
ect is the only effort of its kind to bring together a diverse group of sen=
ior executives to undertake the following:  1) Agree upon the appropriate m=
ethodology; 2) Using the methodology, authorize a panel of experts to indep=
endently evaluate the technologies on their state of development and curren=
t commercial viability; 3) Make policy recommendations on what changes may =
be required to integrate these new technologies into the existing regulator=
y framework and eliminate identified barriers to commercial deployment; and=
 4) Conduct an educational campaign to raise public awareness and acceptanc=
e of these technologies. =20

The project will begin in the Fall of 2001 and a Final Report will be issue=
d January 2002.  The project is expected to have a significant impact on de=
cisions made by regulators, financial analysts, utility executives, the med=
ia and potential customers.   Consistent with the Center's usual practice, =
the Project will include public are as well as private sector participants,=
 and will culminate in a public report.=20


We would welcome your participation Steve, or the appropriate Enron designa=

a chance to review the attached Project description (which is about 12 page=
s).  As I'm currently out of the country, the best way to reach me is via e=

Please replace the prior version I forwarded to you.  I cleaned up some redlines and added the following argument to the Standards Approval and Development section:

In addition, segments should not be defined and populated in such a way as to provide a single interest with repetitive votes nor allow an entity with widespread interests to dominate the votes.

RE: August 20th Joint Legislative/Regulatory Affairs Meeting
      on Reliability Legislation
      -Summary of EPSA Position
      -Exploration of Future Initiatives

The August 20th Meeting

On August 20th, the EPSA's Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation.  Dave Nevius of NERC explained the current draft of the so-called stakeholder "consensus" bill, and Bobby Lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by PJM.  After these presentations, Nevius and Lamb responded to numerous questions.  Thereafter, EPSA members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals, concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to NERC's bill.

Specifically, EPSA members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new, "streamlined" version of the NERC bill.  Additionally, serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the NERC bill in any way that would make it acceptable.  General observations about the fundamental aspects of the NERC bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form FERC to an overly complex, prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities (apparently successors to existing Regional Reliability Councils).

Regarding alternatives, there was consensus that the general approach contained in the PJM proposal, subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses, could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues.  While EPSA members clearly are "leaning toward" the PJM  bill, the proposals raises serious questions concerning: (1) the states' role regarding "adequacy" and their right to adopt "more stringent" standards based upon "compelling need," even if inconsistent with national standards; and (2) limited provision for coordination with Canada and Mexico.

The PJM Proposal

PJM's proposal contains a number of positive aspects, including:

?Its simplicity: it is only 5 pages long.  Members and staff on Capitol Hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation.  The PJM proposal is at least 10 pages shorter than the NERC bill.

?FERC and the RTOs would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards.  The NERC language gives substantial deference to the ERO (in all likelihood, NERC, reformed in ways that are not yet clear or certain) and accompanying ARREs (successors to the Regional Reliability Councils).

?EISB - With the expected approval of the formation of EISB at the upcoming meeting of the GISB Board on September 19th, coupled with strong support from FERC Commissioners Wood, Brownell and Massey, the PJM proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate EISB.  The NERC bill is unclear how an EISB would be accommodated, if at all.
Some issues raising concern which need to be addressed, include:

?State role - the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries.  Only through applications from affected parties can FERC review state actions and may delay such state action, although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it.

?International issues - specifically interfaces with Canada and Mexico.  The language expresses the need to establish "harmonious" reliability standards with each country throughout the North American region.  While simply instructing FERC to do so, PJM's proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished.

?Variances - The NERC language presently allows for interconnection wide variances.  The WSCC favors this approach and the Senate Energy Committee, with the bulk of its membership from the west region, may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance.  Whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore.

Next Steps

The game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the PJM bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to it's attracting wider support.  While this memo summarizes several key issues, there may be others which will need to be discussed.  Please bring these ideas up for discussion during the NAERO Working Group conference call scheduled for Tuesday, September 4 at 2:30 pm (EDT) including any suggested language and changes to improve the PJM proposal. To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the EPSA/Mark Bennett call.  We are looking to begin the process of working with PJM as quickly as possible and your input is needed.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Bennett, Manager of Policy (mbennett@epsa.org) or Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs (dsalvosa@epsa.org) at (202) 628-8200.

Since I am Chairman of the NERC Interchange Subcommittee (Policy 3 Interchange), Grid South has approached my group to review a proposal that it become the interchange scehduling agent for all its members.

This is a preliminary proposal at this time and Grid South is "shopping" how its proposal meets Policy 3 requirements. 

I would like you all to point out "holes" in their proposal that can establish road-blocks for non-control areas from competing.  Assuming that multiple control areas will be part of their structure, please consider: "What more should GridSouth do and what less should its control area members do?"  

I do not want to compromise my leaderhip position at NERC, so please keep these documents and discussions internal to Enron at this time.

Grid South representatives will be at the Interchange Subcommittee Friday the 29th, so please give me your open and honest opinions by Thursday evening.

Thank You

Attached are the materials for the GridSouth portion of the meeting on
Friday - a copy of the Scheduling Strawman as well as a copy of our
presentation.  We are all scheduled to arrive in Philly approx 9:00 and
will catch a taxi to the hotel, arriving in time for a 10:00
presentation.
As you can tell by reviewing the presentation, we should have ample time
for Q&A, but many of the details, esp at the borders are to be
determined.

One of the essential items we would like to leave with is a sense of
what
the process needs to be for us to seek and receive the proper NERC
approvals to allow GridSouth to act as an "agent" for the CAs for
Operating
Policy requirements.

With the understanding that these are draft documents, under constant
review and revision, these may be disseminated.

As we have already discussed, we will have representation from CPL (Phil
Creech), Duke, and SCEG (Lee Xanthakos). I will moderate the discussion
and
Q&A, deferring to the others as needed.

Per Jim Steffes request, this is what I talked about in Houston.

I had particularly emphasized the need to define the functions of Control Areas that we want independent from the vertical utilities so that we can leverage that to push for single control areas.

Andy. I do not know who Gordon is nor his connections with the rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed e-mail to him. This is what I know:

The BOT wanted some immediate action, the NERC staff was under pressure (criticism) at the meeting. The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latch-on to some positive development. NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out, (where this effort may be re-directed to EISB for continuation)  Some stakeholders smelled a rat, and wanted to link NERC's link to this effort to a new committee voting structure; therefore  items 7, 8, and 9 were modified to reflect these comments,  and this is how the resolution came out below (see below).

The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership. It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it. 

Next week (Tuesday)  I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA

Jose
	


Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards 
(Board Agenda Item 20)

WHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and

WHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and

WHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and

WHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS "What" and "How" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and 

WHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and 

WHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and

WHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:

1.	Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.

2.	Actively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.

3.	Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.

4.	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.

5.	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.

6.	Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.

7.	Recommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.

8.	Urge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.

9.	Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.

Subject:	RE: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the "new sector weighted voting model" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  "new sector weighted voting model?"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just "annex" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

To add to Charles memo..

1) The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders c=
ommittee. That was very positive.

2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues.=
=20

3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m=
ake the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example =
EISB

4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations=
 should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:

1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board=
 direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent=
ation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached "Initial Sectors and =
Criteria Model." This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for rep=
resentation by "sector," and incorporates the Task Force's general recognit=
ion that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that s=
ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th=
e criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri=
a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assumi=
ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode=
l, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends =
that two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi=
ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f=
or ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen=
ted.

2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open part=
icipation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. T=
he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure=
s used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features o=
f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures=
. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac=
h sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.

3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be pres=
ented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concer=
ns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.

4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for d=
eveloping Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial=
 Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven=
t itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in t=
hat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings=
.

5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d=
ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Fun=
ding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, sho=
uld be pursued.

6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immedi=
ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce=
ss, and to provide a "bridge" until the new Organization Standards process =
is implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operatin=
g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, includin=
g consideration of any minority positions.

5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po=
ssible alternative.

6) Silence on the issue of "self regulating organization" . No one advocati=
ng that position.

7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.

Subject:=09Stakeholder Committee Notes

Here are some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco=
uver this Monday.

The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  =
Reps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.

All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the=
 customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Cust=
omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which=
 offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o=
rganization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task F=
orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.

Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues
To ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in =
front of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are need=
ed to get individual entities "on board" however, such details should not i=
mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.=
e.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to kee=
p details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.

The actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the nee=
d for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns o=
f the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most v=
ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (G=
lenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also su=
pportive). =20

Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators
Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC =
does not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions=
 made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro=
m Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu=
tion.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c=
ompetitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC sho=
uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly=
 and specifically with the problem.=20

A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions=
:
1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.
2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci=
fic actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)

The vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte=
nded to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the indu=
stry is over this issue.

The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting=
 reconvened.
The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:

?=09Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of =
wholesale electric industry standards. =20
?=09Add words that "we need to go forward from where we are.
?=09Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in=
 new Board agenda item 22.
?=09Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an=
d US government entities.
?=09Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state=
 and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open a=
nd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes=
 of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus=
try standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such cap=
abilities.
?=09Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operat=
ion issues as they affect wholesale operations.

Agenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion
Reference to "incentive rates", and "accelerated amortization", should be r=
emoved, not a reliability policy need.=20
The reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and =
does not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public pe=
rception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will pre=
sent this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both =
sides.

Rick

The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NERC team conference call.

John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM approach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislation.  

Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC stakeholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization - SSO).

The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation.  

Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legislation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good job.  By knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in the legislation.  

We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

Are the sinking (parking and hubbing) advantages relevant in the NE model?  These are key competitive advantages of control areas in the contract path world.

Thanks Howard -- for the SE, we are pushing the one control area, but we may get there via unbalanced schedules and real time market (which actually provides the control area competitve advantages to all without undoing the current control areas.)  Currently, the "business models" in the SE are pretty much keeping control areas as usual.  I don't think that our NE group agreeing to more than one control area on the basis that the NE will have a one market model in place hurts us here.  We would be way ahead of the game if we already had that in the SE.

Subject:	Enron Opening Statement

Attached are some suggested minor revisions to the Enron opening statement previously circulated by Dan Allegretti. I've added a paragraph to indicate our general agreement with the key principles developed by the group of generators and marketers. Also, we continue to call for one control area; the rest of the marketers/generators  thought that wasn't critical if you have one market and one RTO. i.e, there's nothing left for separate control areas to do that would conflict with each other; the staffs would all be part of one organization. Do we still feel strongly about this item?

Thanks to Jim and Charles for the reports on the NERC conference call earlier today.  Aside from whatever is done directly with NERC on details of their internal operations to respond to our concerns (i.e., Jeff's presentation to their board and the list of issues Charles had), the NERC/PJM drafting process will continue in DC in coming weeks.  In addition, Congressional staff are likely to be drafting electricity legislation, including a reliability title, during the August Recess that will start at the end of this week (i.e., we will likely be asked to comment on reliability legislation before any meetings with the NERC board are completed).  I will analyze the "shortened NERC" and "PJM Revised" versions and share some thoughts based on our objectives.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

Jim --

Will focus on the funding source as one of the issues in the drafts.  I assume we would want FERC to have to approve their budget, correct?  When you say "not industry funding" -- where else would it come from?  I assume we don't want to allow the "piper to call the tune" so to speak based on who pays the bill?  My recollection is that in the NERC version of the bill they "walled off" the funding in a manner we would find objectionable, but let me double check that fact.

I don't have anything to add to John, there was no mention if ESC, OASIS II, seams issues, etc. at the Stakeholder Committee meeting on Monday.

I am cc: Jose and Richard to jog their memories.  If you guys recall anything about the discussion, please let Mark and I know.

I do however, want to tell you about the conversation I just had with Dave Nevius.  He called me to check the Enron concerns about the ESC resolutions as expressed by Andy Rodriquez' email.

Dave reverted to the fact that the sector voting model was language added at the request of John Anderson and Vann Prater.  I explained to him that those words were needed as an add on to salvage what we could.  If NERC was going to adopt the resolutions 7-9 concerning the ESC, John's concern (and I agree with him) was that the ESC structure doesn't work.  I think you agree as well given the response to the joint TCCG request to Gent last year re: membership on the ESC.  The intent of the additional language was to make the best of a bad situation.  If the ESC was going to be roped into NERC, it should at least adopt the new voting structure.  

This may be useful info. for you.

Charles--Thanks for this.  On the NERC front, it is becoming increasingly important to know  exactly what, if any, discussion the Stakeholders Committee engaged in specifically relating to the ESC.  John Anderson told me that the first draft of the Resolution on NERC's role on market interface/commercial practices did NOT contain points 7-9 addressing the ESC.  According to John, those provisions were added overnight by Nevius and company.

It is important to know whether, and how, the Stakeholders Committee discussed the ESC, particularly whether their was consensus on the ESC issue.  Julie and Lynne are meeting with Pat Wood on Tuesday to discuss general matters and may have an opportunity to briefly address this an NERC/EISB stuff.  It would be good for them to point out to Wood that, contrary to Gent's letter, the Stakeholder Committee was in fact not wholely supportive of all aspects of the Resolution.  Please let me know what you determine.

Thanks!

Please replace the prior version I forwarded to you.  I cleaned up some redlines and added the following argument to the Standards Approval and Development section:

In addition, segments should not be defined and populated in such a way as to provide a single interest with repetitive votes nor allow an entity with widespread interests to dominate the votes.

Jose

In the cover letter to Mike Gent to transmit our Enron SSO document, it would be good to flag to Mike that Enron will participate in any forum to discuss the formation of an SSO.  This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter EPSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NERC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox we will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to keep feet on both sides of the fence.

The strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keeping competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere near finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB now more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spinmeister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and the Hill.  

My new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and inclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation process (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th quadrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight.

Mark

These are some points for you to consider on your call with Dave Goulding today and for the upcoming Task Force meeting on NERC membership.

Please try to read before calling me today.

This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

Thank You

Subject:	Partial Draft of Paper for Friday's Conference Call


Attached is a partial draft of a MIPS paper addressing the process for MI and Commercial practices.  It got a little more complicated than I anticipated so it is not finished.  However, I did outline the unfinished sections so you can get an idea of how it is supposed to finish.  I will try to get it completed before the call so you can see the whole paper.  I would appreciate your comments on the call.

For the additional items that the MIPS is presenting to the MIC, please refer to Agenda Item 7 in the MIC package.  The MIC package is at following URL:  http://www.nerc.com/~filez/micmin.html

Change in strategy.

We need to include the arguments for FERC rulemaking.  I have accepted the changes re: "FERC created".

The answer to your question about financial bilaterals is that they are NOT a part of the SSO standards.  I added the word "physical" to the transactions and if you look at the ensuing paragraph, I explain that purely financial arrangements are exlcuded.

I hope this works.  Let me know and I will get this to EPSA ASAP.  BFN (bye for now)

I have some comments, which are attached.  I redlined my changes, and they appear in light blue (there are several red-lined colors in the document).  Many of the changes are editorial, but some are also substantive and are based on our prior position, developed when we were working on legislation, that FERC has to create the SSO.  If we are taking the position in this document that an SSO can be created without FERC, then you may want to delete the references to FERC creating the SSO.  I also included a couple of questions where I thought a statement was unclear.  You may just want to reword the sentence to make it a little clearer.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

	I have reviewed the SSO principles -- look good to me.  Thanks for sending them to look at.

John and Sarah

In the aftermath of the NERC BOT resolutions last week that wraps in business practices under the NERC purview, we are being asked by Nevius and Gent if we are in support of NERC becoming the SSO.

I have drafted a response that outlines what we need from an SSO.  We are not indicating if we support NERC or GISB/EISB - but are seeking the resolution of key fundamentals of an SSO before we sign on.

Per Jim's request, please take a look at the words and let me know if you have any concerns.  I plan to send this to EPSA so they can borrow some of the language for a letter that the EPSA-NAERO working group agreed to send to NERC.  I also will send it to Dave Nevius under Jose and my signature.
