Getting alot of inquiries.

The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.

We'll report back as soon as something happens.

For folks who want to listen in, the number is:

415.228.4550
code = 92105

Best,
Jeff

Aluminum Smelters (DSI's)

Alcoa Aluminum
There are no new developments in the Alcoa - BC Hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap, stable energy.  Alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller, since the load reduction agreement with BPA is still in effect.

It should be noted that BC's Premier, Gordon Campbell, has had long-standing poor relations with Alcan, Inc. of Canada, a competitor of Alcoa's.  While in the opposition, Campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed Alcan to finish a $1.3B hydroelectric power project.  Earlier this year, BC Hydro considered a plan to refund Alcan some money for an energy buy-back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border.  If Campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with, he will likely do so - to that end, look for Alcoa and BC Hydro talks to be productive if the Premier has anything to say about it.

Alcoa is still in talks with BPA on potential continued load reduction agreements.  In a recent shareholder meeting last week, Alcoa's management was peppered with questions from Wall Street fund managers regarding the BPA talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out, and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the Pacific Northwest and re-establishing revenue growth.

Kaiser Aluminum
With the hiring of Harvey Perry as the company's new aluminum chief, Kaiser's long-term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear.  As the only DSI to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with BPA, they are still in discussions.  If anything new arises, we will keep you updated.

BC Hydro

BC Government
Campbell's government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the House bill to approve ANWR drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration.  Some of the communities in northern British Columbia, such as Fort. St. John, Dawson Creek, Black Gold and Fort McMurray, have had significant recent population booms, and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region.  Currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from ANWR through British Columbia.   Significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers, which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between BC and Alaska.

BC Hydro
Hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers.  Due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power, BC Hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the "Jobs for Power" program, and pursuing lucrative cross-border contracts with US firms.  At the same time, Hydro will be moving to slice community programs (anywhere from $6 to $8 million) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $20-$25 million range.  BC Hydro, whose annual revenues hover typically around $300 million, is looking at early mini-budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $375 million range.  Its trading subsidiary, PowerEx, has not come back with a refund counteroffer to California, and it looks like CA will have to take this issue to court.
BC Hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board, which is looking more and more likely to be Larry Bell, from Campbell's transition team.  We have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate, although we believe he is a vice-president at West Coast Energy.  The selection will not likely occur for another two weeks, so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late October or November.  In the meantime, Campbell and Gary Collins (the Finance Minister) will be calling the shots on Hydro's future.  Keep in mind that the Minister of Energy and Mines, Neufeld, has the official title, but his power has been greatly curbed by the Premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda.

Bonneville Power Administration

Financial Solvency
After having a chance to speak with a source close to Sen. Patty Murray's (D-WA) office, it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide BPA an additional $2 billion in borrowing authority (over the $3.75 billion of existing authority it already has) may be scuttled.  Sen. Murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced BPA to come back to the Senate every year for review - the White House, the Senate Appropriations Committee, OMB and the Budget Committee have all been opposed to the entire bill.  The feeling is that if the $2 billion of additional authority would be issued, the money would be coming off the back of Social Security and Medicare.

Eight northwest Senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half.  The next time this issue will come up again is the middle of September, when there is another energy bill conference.  Obviously, now that Bush's energy bill has passed the House, they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on Democratic Senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend BPA borrowing authority is linked with support for ANWR drilling.

Spill Issues
The $5 million spill over two Columbia River dams a few short weeks after BPA administrator Steve Wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups.  

Fish managers, notably CRITFC's Bob Heinith and ODFW's Christine Mallette, had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none, but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year. Power operators and the Corps of Engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill, citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water, making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams, and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike-minnow.

Dam Breaching
Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower Snake dams. It would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the Corps of Engineers to "partially remove" the dams if the Secretary of Commerce finds it necessary to satisfy ESA, Clean Water Act or tribal treaty obligations. 

"The Bush Administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 Salmon Recovery Plan to avoid dam removal," McDermott said in a July 19 press release. "If this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously, and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams, then no one would be happier than I would," he said. "Now is the time to plan for all contingencies." 

Co-sponsored by Tom Petri (R-WI) and 19 other representatives--but no others from the Northwest--the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee, where opposition has massed quickly, led by Butch Otter (R-ID) and Doc Hastings (R-WA). The two issued "Dear Colleague" letters asking fellow members not to support McDermott's bill.  
Pacific Northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching.  The environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically.  Now that energy prices have come down again, they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now.

Forestry Issues

Forest Fires
One of the largest forest fires in the Pacific Northwest, the Thirty Mile Fire, which claimed the lives of four firefighters, is under control this week.  The only other major fire in this region currently is the 4,800-acre Union Valley fire in Southeast Washington State.  The fire is three and a half miles north of Chelan, WA, and evacuations of residences continue in upper Union Valley and in Washington Creek drainage.  The fire continues to spread north into Washington Creek drainage.  Burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed.  We have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission.

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today. 

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp=
ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s=
atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Com=
mission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it=
s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf=
iguration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la=
ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they=
 failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or =
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order s=
tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi=
ssion organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates t=
hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requir=
es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

On Tuesday, February 27, we have been invited to a cocktail party in honor of Vincent Viola of Pioneer Futures. Vince is currently running for Chairman of the NYMEX. His competitor in the upcoming election is Joe Rafferty of Rafferty and Associates. Personally, I have no preference who is the next Chairman, but due to the adversarial nature of Enron's recent relationship with Dan Rappaport and the NYMEX this may us an opportunity to meet and talk to Vince. Rumor has it that Vince is the current frontrunner for the position. The party will be held at 5:00-7:00pm at Sambuca Jazz Cafe, 909 Texas, (713) 224-5299. Let me know if you are interested in attending.

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State T=
reasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the i=
nitial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is al=
so not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's =
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric fu=
tures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return fo=
r money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor thi=
s plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of legisla=
tors are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve Californi=
a's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish legislato=
rs, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and busines=
s leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the plan =
is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power Aut=
hority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up transmiss=
ion lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly legislated =
authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) although=
 they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power co=
mpanies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarant=
ee a 5%-15% "cushion" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton wan=
t to create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of=
 the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector g=
eneration.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new p=
lants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds (=
in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in th=
e Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consume=
rs and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this gr=
oup and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45%=
 increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there i=
s immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on bu=
sinesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by prev=
ious PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: sto=
p the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent emergen=
cy tax hikes (being serious considered last week). =20
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current=
 shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owe=
d debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal=
 Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to "eat" in the legislated r=
epayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts b=
e?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to =
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive =
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.

What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds?
"The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR=
, essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be availa=
ble for purchasing power. It is really their job to define what each party =
needs to pay for power. We need to give assurance to the investment communi=
ty that whatever the overall rate is, the state will get enough to pay its =
bonds. However, if the utilities challenge the decision, it could stall the=
 bond issuance."
What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue?
"Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorize=
d, around $10bn. The PUC has allowed us to sell north of  $13bn, but we ant=
icipate that $10bn is absorbable. Until the administration provides details=
 for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and w=
hat it needs in terms of funding, what will drive it is that number, not wh=
at the PUC has said. The issuance may well be a single $10bn issue or a ser=
ies of smaller ones done together, e.g. $3bn each 3 weeks apart."
What is the total size of the market for CA tax-exempt bonds?
"What we do normally is $5-10bn in bonds for various revenues or general ob=
ligations. In 1997 the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $7bn i=
ssuance, and this was handled well.  This is not exclusively a CA market.  =
Around $200bn of these bonds is sold each year.   We anticipate that the bo=
nds will be 70% tax-exempt and 30% non-exempt."
What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to requ=
ire funding?
"We have estimates. The DWR is buying power, and let's say power costs $100=
 and its portion of rates is $70. This bond issuance covers the diff betwee=
n $100 and $70. So, the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap. However, i=
f power prices do not come down, you cannot keep borrowing.  If we issue mo=
re than $10bn in bonds, I have to see the whole financial plan.  (The impli=
cation is that he will not keep this plan secret.)"
What will be the term mix of the bond issues?
"Overall term is expected to be in the 10-15 year range.  I do not know the=
 mix."
Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything l=
ike that to take care of the general fund?
"The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and ta=
x-exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued.  In order for us to issue bond=
s, a number of steps have to occur. I would hope that the PUC and DWR do wh=
at they have to do realistically by June.  Then the bond issuance would com=
e semi all-at-once.  (In other words, either all at once, or something like=
 $3 billion every three weeks.)"
Are all of the general funds' assets in cash, or are some in the form of a =
less liquid receivable?
"We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund.  We have a cash f=
low. We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can=
 go out to five years. We have $40bn-plus in that account."
What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day-to=
-day operations?
"It depends, and goes up and down.  On any given day we are doing on the or=
der of $500mm. There is a $100bn budget between the general funds and speci=
al fund."
Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding?=
 Do you have a veto on the deals struck?
"This is all in the administration's court.  What we have asked for is the =
information.  We have asked for this today by letter.  We have to move from=
 working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering, which means public disclos=
ure.  The general fund has been making advances to buy power, but we want t=
o get out of that business and to stop the $4bn plus drain on general fund =
from arranging an interim loan."
What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking o=
r self-selecting?
"There are limits on the options out there.  AB1X has limited the ability o=
f people to opt out of the system.  If you do allow them to opt out, what d=
o they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream? The agreement between th=
e DWR and the PUC will say that, through a financing order, we will get you=
 the revenue to service the bonds, even if it adjusts rates.  This will be =
a covenant that the money will be made available."
If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an =
effect on ABIX or the bond issuance? What about "Harvey proofing"?  What is=
 the direct state participation?
"The state's role is infrastructure and economic development.  Bonds will b=
e issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying, not to r=
epay utility deb.  I don't think the state will repay utility debt.  The st=
ate can buy power in or out of Chapter 11.  There will be no participation =
by the state bank.  I know Harvey well, and he and I agree on a number of t=
hings.  For example, I am cosponsoring the public power authority. We shoul=
d not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt.  I don't t=
hink most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for powe=
r.  I very much want, and it is in my interest, to repay the general fund. =
 At the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy, the=
 fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generators-th=
e ransom that is being demanded by the generators. I agree with Harvey that=
 as of this current time the generators are winning.  We will have to consi=
der excess profits taxes, or if the generators continue, they have increase=
d their prices tenfold.  The generators they bought a set of plants for $3.=
1bn.  Since January the state has spent over $4bn.  If the generators don't=
 take their foot off our throat, they may leave us no option but to take ba=
ck plants under emergency power.   So let them justify those rates.  What c=
auses the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where th=
ey will make us do something about it."
What is the "measurable size premium" that will have to be paid based on th=
e most current estimates of bond issue size?
"Measurable is the wrong choice of words.  We don't know how many basis poi=
nts. If it is more than $10bn, we will begin to feel it.=20
Also, I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the gene=
rators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period. They should work that out =
themselves, not on the backs of ratepayers.  The perspective here is that t=
hey did very, very well in 1996, 97 and 98.  They upstreamed billions."

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Weekend Developments of the SoCal MOU 
?	SoCal & Creditors Weigh Bankruptcy Options

California Senate Adjourns Without a Bailout Vote
As previously reported (9/14), our prediction of Sen. John Burton discouraging support of the SoCal bailout did, in fact, play-out.  Burton's last minute vote polls indicated that there were only four Senate Democrats favoring the MOU and an in extraordinary move, Burton adjourned the Senate without bothering to let AB 67XX face a floor vote.  The following outline the prevailing factors that led to Burton's decision:

?	Reportedly, in addition to virtually no Republican support, a coalition between at least 7 far left Democrats and pro-business Democrats convinced legislators not to vote on bailout legislation.  

?	At one point Treasurer Angelides pulled Senator Bowen aside and told her that the revenue bonds might sell with direct access after all.  She then accused Angelides of having lied to her about this in originally telling her that a bond sale would not be possible if direct access was included.  

?	Both Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides appear to have damaged their relationship with the Senate.  Davis stated that he would not sign Burton's legislation due to its ineffectiveness and additionally he would veto Burton's bill separating the revenue streams for bond payment and payments for power.  
 
Given the state of relations in Sacramento, Senators are likely to offer little or no cooperation on a bailout plan if Davis calls another emergency session.  See Burton's response (paraphrased):  "I'm going to be on jury duty, and I'm not going to exercise my right to be excused."  He's also not going to ask people to come back and, as of last Saturday (9/15), most people on the business Democrat and Republican side at least were not planning on doing so.  

Bankruptcy Looms for SoCal 
It currently looks bleak for SoCal.  Davis and Bryson have expended their political capital on this effort.  The creditors' committee is reportedly meeting to discuss how, when and by whom a filing should take place.  Edison executives have assured Davis that the company will not file for bankruptcy and that its creditors will show restraint. However, it's unclear whether all of the utility's creditors will forebear on an involuntary bankruptcy filing. Spokespersons for several large generators said Friday (9/14) afternoon that they couldn't speculate on what their companies would do if the legislature failed to act on the Edison rescue bill that night.  Davis aides say the governor would seek a reduced rescue package for Edison when the legislature returns, but in the meantime, Davis continues informal negotiations with legislators in effort to stave-off SoCal's bankruptcy.

Executive Summary:

Utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles- agreement on payback for the bailout, rate increases, and further short-term funding for DWR purchases of power.
Disagreement persists between Gov. Davis and Democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities.  The split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets.
The economics of the long-term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period.
Air Quality Management District regulations are under review, but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity.
Legislature Democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left-wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow, if not stop, Davis's bailout and rate hike plans.  Senator Burton's eminent domain threats against generators, which reflect this pressure, are of little significance.


1.	Bankruptcy Outlook Rising Once Again

A deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state, the utilities, and their creditors, with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on Tuesday.  

SoCal Edison and PG&E are not paying any of their bills except for payroll.  They are working very hard to keep cash on-hand, and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing.  Once this filing occurs, they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy.  

Opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy.  Assemblyman Keeley told our source that a filing is likely, but that everything will be resolved during that 50-day period.  Senator John Burton "is in no hurry" to reach a deal with the utilities, as he believes that the State of  California is in a good position to "strong-arm" the utilities.  Burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy.   The Senator stated, "bankruptcy would be bad, but not the worst thing possible."  He intends to stick to his position.  Senator Burton also dismissed Governor Davis' end-of-week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities.

Still, bankruptcy can be avoided if a last-minute deal can be struck Monday on:
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes (a federal court is expected to rule on the PG&E/SoCal v. CPUC rate undercollection case Monday)
additional financing is made available to the DWR to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in May.

There is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance.  However, the negative tone taken by Standard & Poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve.  The previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high-level Washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend.

Additional financing for DWR will not be automatically approved by the legislature.  The non-energy expenditures of the California government are now at risk, as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the General Fund.

2.	State to Take 2/3 of Utility Debt

While the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $12 billion debt, a final deal has been held up on two fronts.  First, it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt.  It is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and/or transmission assets.  A takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets.  The value of these assets still has not been settled.  Second, while the state will be on the hook for $9 billion, it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout.  Finally, expect Davis and other California politicians to work to minimize rate hikes (although the Edison/PG&E v. CPUC case on Monday is likely to force their hand here) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout.  The tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants.

No price has been set at which the State would purchase the utilities' transmission assets, which are currently valued at approximately $7-$8 billion.  All of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities' debts, as some of the money would go to existing bondholders.  However, IPP sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer.

3.	Long-Term Contracts

As noted by the governor in his announcement Tuesday, only 500 MW of the 5,000 MW of power contracted for can come on-line immediately.  Much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long-term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants.  Some of this will come on-line in approximately two years.

Assemblyman Keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "tablet from on high" from Governor Davis that there must not be a rate increase.  This means that the state must acquire power, not from internal sources or from the market, but through long-term contracts at 7.39 cents/kwh.  This allows 1.213 cents to amortize SoCal Edison's undercollection from the recent rate freeze period.  (The number is slightly different for PG&E.)  This assumption is based on a natural gas price of $7.90 in 2001 and $5.15 in 2005, and an efficiency heating rate of 10,000 - 12,000 in 2001 and 7,200 in 2005.

These numbers were quoted to industry sources, who felt they were unrealistic.  These sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $9.00 - $9.50.  The sources agreed with Keeley's number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate, but they felt that 7,200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line.

According to Keeley's numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $7 billion rather than $12 billion, it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection.  A settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the State can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection.  However, since Assemblyman Keeley's numbers are unrealistic, a rate increase will be necessary.

4.	Air Quality District Exemptions

There have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from AQMD (Air Quality Management District) regulations -- AB 20X, AB 28X, AB 31X. Also, Republicans have been asking the Governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in San Jose that was denied by the local government.

Currently there is no contemplation of loosening the AQMD compliance restrictions.  The legislature will not allow "dirtier" plants to
 come on-line.  However, there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern California by moving away from the
 use of credits (this apparently drives up the cost of gas-fired power). 

5.	Democratic Moderates Pressured by Consumer Advocates

  The moderate left (Sen. Burton, the PUC, consumer activists) is afraid of Harvey Rosenfield and his consumers movement.  This is not just because of his initiative.  More important from their perspective, his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election.  Thus, Democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from Davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout.

6. 	Eminent Domain Would Have A Limited Effect

The threats by Burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited.  They only apply to California suppliers.  A
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out-of-state suppliers. There are also Canadian suppliers (such as BC Hydro) who are essentially untouchable.

7.	Smaller IPPs Feeling the Squeeze

Many of the smaller IPPs, which account for approximately 2500 MW of production, appear to be within a few days of running out of cash.  
AB 1X may be amended, possibly sometime this week, to give the smaller producers credit support.

My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.  Apologies.
 

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

Best,

Jeff

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the "failure to act", sellers for hi=
gh prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press packag=
e.  Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net shor=
t is 34%.  Sellers "have us over a barrell" for those sales.  Attorney Gen =
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=
ts -- this doesn't address the "$ for the hot dog, which is being taken car=
e of in Sacramento."  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=
 Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call=
. Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- "our cries have fallen =
on deaf ears"

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order that the IOUs to pay the QFs begin=
ning 4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Secti=
on 390 (Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the S=
RAC gas index from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) =
to Malin, where prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
 purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power fo=
r purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that t=
he payments are for going forward costs. "It's time to pay the power bills =
for California."  CPA calculated based on the "residual" method, rather tha=
n the proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method=
, however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
. (The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge pe=
rmanent (we believe that this is additive with the 3 cents - 4 cent total) =
Believe this covers ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX =
1, small customers with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers=
 with 200% increase, get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  A=
dopted TURN's accounting proposal implying that the Rate Freeze is not yet =
over.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes IOUs 30-45 d=
ays to charge the rates (although could come earlier); will conduct a rate =
design proceeding during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e if it is best for the public utilities to be outside holding companies.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate st=
ructure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  Nee=
d information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided it. =
 Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above -- w=
ould expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=

Agreement in principle.  Still need to negotiate definitive contracts.  Man=

Subject:=09Summary of the MOU

The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California E=
dison Memorandum of Understanding:

?=09Commitment to Provide Power - SCE will keep its current generation plan=
ts and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regula=
ted cost-of-service basis for 10 years.
?=09Dedication of Power - Edison International will commit the entire outpu=
t of Sunrise (one of Edison International's non-regulated generating facili=
ties) to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise =
is to be brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August=
 15, 2001, Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.
?=09Transmission Sale - SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets =
for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets=
), subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion g=
ain on sale, will be used to reduce SCE's net undercollected amount as of J=
anuary 31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assum=
e certain liabilities associated with the transmission assets.
?=09Backup Transaction - If the transmission sale does not occur within two=
 years for reasons beyond the parties' control, then if the State elects, S=
CE shall sell to the State SCE's hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse=
ts are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Dece=
mber 31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.
?=09Conservation Property - SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easement=
s to the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroe=
lectric related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric rel=
ated lands.  Some of the land may be deeded in fee.
?=09Contribution by Edison International - Edison International will refund=
 to SCE not less than $400 million.  This money will consist of a refund of=
 approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus a=
pproximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
?=09Investment - Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3 =
billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
?=09Litigation - SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings an=
d filed rate doctrine cases.
?=09CPUC Regulation - CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical =
principles of ratemaking.
?=09Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off - SCE shall pay an amount that repre=
sents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1, 2001 =
that is attributable to QF's not selling to SCE (due to SCE's failure to pa=
y the QF's).  SCE will securitize this amount.
?=09Securitization - SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amoun=
t (approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (=
i.e. two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).

?=09The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the s=
igning of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected a=
mount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the n=
et undercollected amount.
?=09The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=
 occur within two years.  Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up=
 in rates for two years, if at all.

?=09Buying the Net Short - The State will be required to buy the net short =
through December 31, 2002.  After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering=
 the net short.
?=09Investment Recovery - SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that =
will not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of serv=
ice ratemaking period.
?=09Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action):

?=09Definitive Agreements - Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to ne=
gotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the trans=
mission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other related ag=
reements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and the =

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex."

Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation (when they return from recess).  Currently, they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB78XX while introducing a new bill SB_XX.  Working under the assumption that they would amend bill 78XX and introduce a new one, the following issues are a reflection of their current positions.  If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation.  Please remember, these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change.

SoCal Debt
SB _XX
No provision for debt.
SB 78XX (amended)
Approximately $2.9B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds (10-15 years).  Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor.

Core vs. Non-Core
SB _XX
For purposes of paying the SoCal debt, creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than ?Kw and Non-Core customers of ?Kw or more.  They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement: (1) all consumers share pro rata for the first two years, (2) Non-Core pay 100% after two years.
SB 78XX(amended)
No Provisions.

Transmission System Purchase
SB _XX and SB 78XX
No purchase of transmission assets.

Conservation Easements
SB _XX
No conservation easements.
SB 78XX(amended)
Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about 24,000 acres per the Governor's MOU.

Direct Access
SB _XX
Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January 1, 2002 and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation, bilateral contracts, and DWR contracts.  Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for Direct Access.

Ratepayer Benefit Account
SB _XX
Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from (a) any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation, and (b) any positive DWR Power Fund revenues; all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March, 2001 PUC rate increase.
SB 78XX(amended)
Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account.

Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust
SB _XX and SB 78XX
Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions.

Renewable Energy
SB _XX
Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to achieve a target of 10% of all new generating capacity additions through 2010 and overall 20% of statewide total generating capacity by 2010.  Munis have been exempted from the RPS.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for renewable energy.

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

If you read Ray Alvarez's summary from yesterday evening, open the attached=
 Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since =
receiving the final order, which was issued this afternoon.  Alan Comnes

The full order is available at: http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.h=
tm

SUMMARY OF FERC'S
ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIF=
ORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLI=
C UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS
(Issued April 26, 2001)

Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs t=
o have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ=
ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time to t=
he extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, eve=
n those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into=
 the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's inters=
tate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This r=
equirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price a=
uction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in th=
e ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a particip=
ating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid =
its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas =
costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost will be the av=
erage daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions ar=
e to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services.  The I=
SO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to be used for the=
 next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These figures (for th=
e next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgeral=
d data. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all g=
enerators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas-fired generator =
must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a confidential basis, hea=
t and emission rates for each generating unit.  The ISO will use these rate=
s to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance an=
d operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at or below the market clea=
ring price will not be subject to refund liability.  (Although the followin=
g qualification is made: "However, all public utility rates will be subject=
 to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market-based rates, =
discussed infra."  Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavio=
r.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, th=
e generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report wit=
h FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC explicitly acknowledges that=
 some units may have gas costs that exceed the "all delivery point" index i=
t has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in rea=
l time.  Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be =
prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or po=
rtfolio with no opportunity cost. =20

Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending =
request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it=
 is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy p=
ower in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator =
subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC=
 order.

New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission's pri=
ce mitigation measures.


Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entit=
ies must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to b=
e curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand curve =
more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours (24/7)=
) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
 outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the =
order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages, includ=
ing periodic reports to the Commission.

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1 or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consiste=
nt with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
 things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d=
ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical with=
hold of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate=
 bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of th=
e generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on un=
it behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently b=
e inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited=
 (i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other=
 prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit muc=
h higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due t=
o increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.

West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  - Opens a section 206 investigation co=
ncerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAI=
SO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitig=
ation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real t=
ime (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot markets w=
hen contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a control area.=
    FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comments=
 are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Although it is still formul=
ating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PNW, the FERC sets t=
he refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine=
s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa=
rt of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generat=
ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr=
ice. =20

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on (1) whet=
her FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an es=
crow account to pay past costs and (2) the effect this surcharge would have=
 on the PG&E bankruptcy filing. =20

Treatment of the CAISO's Market Stabilization Plan (MSP). The FERC rejects =
the CAISO's MSP saying that FERC's plan for market mitigation is sufficient=
.  It expressly rejects CAISO's plan to create a day-ahead and hour-ahead e=
nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to imple=
ment software changes to effectuate such markets.  Unfortunately, it does n=
ot expressly reject CAISO's plan to cut exports.  In general, no mention wa=
s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the stateme=
nt that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO mu=
st honor firm schedules on its system..=20

Executive Summary:

?	The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor
?	An exemption of the gas-fired QFs from this bill (as proposed by Sen. Keeley) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
?	If passed, the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another 15 days after rate hikes to pay the QFs
?	The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the DWR. Senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR. 
?	The CalEnergy ruling (as reported by Bloomberg this PM) is an attractive option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape long-term supply contracts with Edison.
?	If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gas-fired generators from the new rate structure, an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected.  However, if the exemption is implemented, then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed.

1.	"QF Bill" Makes it to Senate Floor


The "CPUC bill" (the number is not yet known) is in mock-up form and does the following:

*	Repeals PUC Code section 390, which set a formula for QFs under deregulation.
*	Amends portions of AB 1X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its power purchases, and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds.
*	Includes a provision for SDG&E rates since they were not covered under other legislation.

The bill passed the Senate Energy (8-2), and also just passed the Senate Appropriations Committee (8-2) and is headed to the Senate Floor.  


2.	Senator Comments on the Bill:

Keeley (author of bill) presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide the QF contracts which is the proper authority  to debate the issue.

Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for natural gas-fired QFs.  Republicans offered an amendment to not have section 390 repealed for gas-fired generators, but Keeley had concerns with the amendment.  Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUC's flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad.  He also indicated that gas-fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order.  He said that the PUC order needs to be amended, and Keeley is confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 hours.

3.	Opponents to the QF Bill:


The following people testified in opposition to QF portion:  TURN, Delta Power (QF), Syke Energy, John Hancock Financial, California Manufacturers Association, Crockett Cogeneration, Independent Energy Producers, Clean Power Campaign, PG&E, SCE.

The gas-fired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been off-line for a couple of months and cannot come back on-line unless their issues are addressed.

In response to the QFs not getting paid, Sen. Bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order, then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy.

4.	PG&E and SCE Testimony:

Sen. Battin asked both utilities about the draft order, which states that after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within 15 days, and whether the utilities would abide by the order.

PG&E's response was that they are receiving $400 million per month, the cost of their own generation is $100 million, and the QF amount is $240 million per month; the draft order would lower the QF cost to $140 million.   PG&E was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to Battin's question was "yes or no."  Battin, Bowen and Murray all asked
whether it was yes or no.  The PG&E rep stated that it would be "no" if the issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved.  If the ISO costs of purchases were included in the DWR payments, then PG&E would not have a problem.

The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out, then it could not comply with the PUC order.

5. 	Payments to DWR

Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB 1X that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those.  SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and conditions.  Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill, and that they should have a trust fund set up.  PG&E noted that they are setting 'some' money aside, but would not state how much. Sen. Sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or 'go after them' for violating the law.

1X Provisions:

Tim Gage from Dept. of Finance noted the Governor's support of the entire bill, and noted that the 1X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid.

PG&E also testified in opposition to these provisions.

Senator Bowen made the following statements:

*	Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of $500 million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless PG&E and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR issue.
*	Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue.

Attached is our filing made yesterday protesting Entergy's proposed transco:

Rate issues are premature until Entergy has filed to join SPP
No support for its proposed Innovative Rates (for example, (i) Entergy would get 5% of a customer-funded transmission project as a development fee and (ii) extra 300 basis points for certain projects) and Exact Recovery mechanism
Request that Commission require grandfathered contracts to be addressed
Express concern of Entergy's request to continue the problematic source and sink limitations

FYI.  

In the attached article, Gov Davis mentions that Enron is one of the generators that have agreed to accept "less than 100 cents on the dollar".   Of course, no one has made such a claim.  

The Governor will say whatever it takes to make his story and polling numbers work.

Highlights of This Issue

Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sell-side and rating
agency analysts in New York yesterday.  The Governor outlined his plan for
restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their
obligations.  Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting.

Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure

The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities'
problems within the context of their existing rate structures. He indicated
that the temporary 9% rate hike from January 2000 would be made permanent and
that a 10% rate reduction that went into effect in January 1998 would be
reversed in March 2002.

Status of Negotiations with PG&E

As we noted in a February 26(**th) comment, the Governor has reached an
agreement in principle with Southern California Edison (EIX: B3/CC) to address
that utility's past under-collections.  He hopes to also have an agreement with
PG&E within the next 30 days, suggesting that progress was made in particular
in the last 2-3 days.  However, the Governor acknowledged that reaching an
agreement with PG&E was more difficult due to its larger under-collected
balance and lower rates compared with SCE.

Some Generators Agree to Haircut

The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily
agreed to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for their past due
receivables. When pressed about which parties they've had constructive
discussions with, he identified Williams (WMB: Baa2/BBB-), Enron (ENE:
Baa1/BBB+) and Dynegy (DYN: Baa2/BBB+).  We note that most of the generators
and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against
possible losses.  Importantly, the Governor said that he hoped that the banks
and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut.

Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative

The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the
utilities that the legislature can support.  Although he admitted that he
couldn't prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative, the governor said
that in the end, the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket
books.  Thus, if there is ultimately a ballot initiative, Governor Davis is
optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited
impact on electric rates.

Status of Defaulted Utility Debt

As we have commented in the past, it appears unlikely that the resulting
legislation will pass with the required 2/3majority to go into effect
immediately.  Accordingly, there will be a several month lag before the
utilities receive any cash.  In response to a question, it appears that the
state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted
commercial paper.  But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will
provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing.
Essentially, it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find
the money from their banks.

Governor's Strategy to Keep the Lights On

The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California
was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years.  In
the intervening time, demand caught up with supply.  In response, he has
proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the
construction of new power plants.  He set a goal of having 20,000 megawatts
(mws) of new supply on line by 2004.

In addition, the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the
transmission infrastructure.  In particular, he cited the need to expand the
capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to
move power from south to north within the state. He suggested that part of the
rationale for the state taking over the utilities' transmission grids was to
ensure that the additional investment takes place.  He also suggested that the
state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to
continue to operate them.

In the meantime, the focus is to move away from California's over-reliance on
the spot market.  In that vein, Calpine (CPN: Ba1/BB+) yesterday announced the
signing of two long-term contracts with the state's Department of Water
Resources (DWR).  One of those contracts was to sell up to 1,000 mws over a ten-
year term.  The other was to provide up to 495 mw of peaking capacity under a
20-year contract.  Earlier in February, CPN had reached agreement with the DWR
on a separate 10-year contract for an additional 1,000 mws.

Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

It appears very likely that SB 78XX will be the lead vehicle for the MOU in the working group discussions and that AB 82XX will move closer to SB 78XX.  (Note: AB 50XX appears to have been dropped by Wright so that he could keep his Energy Committee chairmanship; he was being heavily criticized for opposing the Assembly leadership with his bill.)

The two main points of contention between SB 78XX and AB 82XX appear to be the renewables portfolio (SB 78XX's version is thought of as more reasonable) and the provisions for a PUC reasonableness review of the long-term contracts.  SB 82XX prohibits a reasonableness review, and SoCal is pushing for this language to be incorporated into SB 78XX.  This language was also in the original MOU between SoCal and the governor.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09California Budget Resolved
?=09FERC Ordered Energy Settlements Stall MOU/Plan B=20

BUDGET
California legislators in the House have once again established a tentative=
 reserve amount for the state's depleted budget.  Both sides are reportedly=
 uneasy with the $2.74B compromise and sources indicate that the four Repub=
lican votes needed to pass the budget  in the Assembly are likely far more =
obtainable than the one Republican vote needed in the Senate.  California's=
 current redistricting process may provide Republicans with future seats th=
at could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy and budget mat=
ters.  Adding to the frustration, sources indicate that consumer activist H=
arvey Rosenfield plans to pressure State  Treasurer Angelides into battling=
 with legislators for progress on the budget and revenue bonds.

ENERGY SETTLEMENTS
Today marked opening negotiations for California state energy officials and=
 the several large energy providers who are charged with price gouging Cali=
fornians.  Sources close to California State Sen. Burton report that the re=
sults from the15 days of negotiations before the FERC appointed Administrat=
ive Law Judge, Curtis Wagener, will significantly influence the state's eff=
orts in promoting any Plan B or MOU.  Burton indicated that FERC would need=
 to order between $3 and $4B in generator refunds before the state would fi=
nalize a SoCal bail-out.  Of that amount, SoCal would most likely be infuse=
d with $1B, however, without substantial contributions from power providers=
 that sold into California and currently fall outside FERC's jurisdiction (=
i.e. BC Hydro & LA DWP), a $3 to $5B refund would be impossible to achieve.=
  Regardless of legislators' desires, sources believe that  consistent with=
 the PG&E bankruptcy advisor's view, a multibillion dollar refund from FERC=
 is unlikely.  Sources will continue to monitor and report on these negotia=
tions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
?	CPUC Direct Access Vote

CPUC
LINK TO ? LIVE WEBCAST of CPUC MEETING 10:00 am -@:pm Sept. 20th <http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/announcements/010920_audioaccess.htm>

The sun may be setting on Californians' right to customer choice as the CPUC debates the fate of direct access today.  We estimate that at this time, the CPUC commissioners will NOT be taking up the DA issue and will instead delay the vote until after the legislature has convened the third special session, called by Gov. Davis last week.  Currently, both Commissioners Brown and Wood appear unwilling to support DA; with President Lynch being a swing vote.    

Concerning the retroactive suspension of direct access agreements of customers who have already elected alternate service providers, the current CPUC position appears to be that direct access contracts signed by September 20th, 2001 will NOT be nullified.  There is rumor that the CPUC may be reviewing several of the contracts signed within the past three to nine months.  Many commercial consumers now operating under DA are highly pessimistic about the CPUC supporting DA agreements that have been signed within the past three months.  The business community is very conscience that the CPUC now bears the difficult task of weighing California businesses' political and economic interests against the economic interests of California's residential power consumers.

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting.
However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively.
As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.

Best,
Jeff

Below is the weekly western issues update sent to Tim earlier.  If you have=
 any questions, please feel free to contact me (x39510).

Executive Summary
BC Hydro=20
British Columbia Energy Politics
BPA Developments=20
Forestry Issues
Smelter Update=20

BC Hydro
The crown jewel in BC government's arsenal, BC Hydro is in a holding patter=
n until they can name a new Chair to head up the corporation.  Brian Smith =
was replaced with interim Chairman Robert Fairweather, but we do not expect=
 Fairweather to have a long tenure - the word is Gordon Campbell and compan=
y are seeking a replacement to fill Mr. Smith's shoes as early as mid-Augus=
t.  We expect key changes to occur in Hydro's executive and board of direct=
ors following the appointment of the new Chair.  Although senior management=
 at BC Hydro is relatively comfortable with the company's financial positio=
n and competitiveness, they will be pursuing a strategy of expanding genera=
tion capability through new dams and oil/gas exploration, pending environme=
ntal approvals.  As a part of BC Hydro's move to look for additional genera=
ting capacity, they are turning to a pair of mega-projects that were scrapp=
ed a decade ago.  BC Hydro has commissioned new technical review studies of=
 the 900MW Site C hydroelectric project near Fort St. John and the 2,000 MW=
 coal-fired Hat Creek project near Kamloops.

In terms of a rate hearing, we do not expect BC Hydro to conduct a rate hea=
ring until the new Chairman is appointed.  It will be difficult to get rate=
s raised, although with the government budget deficit looming there will be=
 considerable pressure to begin looking this direction.  Another key revenu=
e challenge for BC Hydro will be responding to the recent price caps impose=
d by FERC on western power markets and potential power purchase refunds to =
California (though their contributions are not immense, they are still sign=
ificant).=20

BC Energy Politics
Things have really heated up in Victoria now that the new Campbell administ=
ration is settling in.  Earlier, we reported that the Office of the Premier=
 had taken control of all the agencies and political staffing decisions.  W=
ith 77 of the 79 elected members of the BC Legislature, sources close to th=
e Premier indicate change will be "fast and furious" to offset any local co=
verage from volatile media.  The BC Government's primary focus will be to s=
timulate the economy while trying to restrain government spending.  To that=
 extent, they have instituted an across the board 25% stimulus tax cut and =
will have to deal with the deficit issues that that cut entails.  One of th=
e ways they are looking to balance things out is to outsource Crown assets =
and look for other areas to generate revenue - new sources of government re=
venue through oil and gas exploration and energy will be a top priority.

Minister of Energy and Mines, Richard Neufeld, will be one of the main driv=
ers behind the current fast-tracking of the offshore oil and natural gas ex=
ploration.  There is a great deal of pressure on the BC Liberals to balance=
 this budget and they will be looking at ways of delivering revenue sources=
 through oil and gas exploration permitting as a short-term solution.  Neuf=
eld has reviewed the Backhouse Report (Northern Development Commission) reg=
arding the need for continued local public input and has basically tossed i=
t aside - the report had not gone far enough to please the Liberals.  Other=
 things on the Minister of Energy's agenda:

?=09Oppose Sumas 2 power project & phase out Burarrd Thermal (Sumas has bee=
n a serious bone of contention between Washington State and Canada)
?=09With Core Review, protect BC Hydro and all of its core assets, includin=
g dams, reservoirs, and power lines under public ownership
?=09Restore independent BC Utilities Commission, to re-regulate BC Hydro's =
electricity rates
?=09Maintain the longstanding ban on bulk water exports
?=09Encourage mineral exploration
?=09Promote clean and renewable alternative energy sources
?=09Review and make recommendations regarding allocation of funding that ha=
s been frozen for the "Power for Jobs" Initiative

BPA
Senator Patty Murray moved last week to drop the review provision on the Se=
nate bill, which would have opened up an additional $2 billion for BPA borr=
owing authority.  If Senator Murray is successful, the measure could have a=
 substantial impact on BPA financial solvency.

With the exception of the approximately $5 million spill over the Dalles an=
d Bonneville dams, BPA has already foregone a major summer spill to protect=
 endangered salmon species. =20

Representatives of four Northwest governors ventured to Washington DC last =
week to express concerns over the new hydro BiOp and how it will be impleme=
nted.  States were concerned about their lack of input in the implementatio=
n process - a plan being developed by action agencies and spearheaded by BP=
A.  The plan has been put on hold pending a review headed by Interior Depar=
tment lawyer Ann Klee.  Idaho and Washington representatives showed concern=
 that the BiOp could be overturned in court - they were concerned that the =
NMFS underestimated the risk of extinction of Snake River stocks and that i=
t was illegal to rely on off-site mitigation to help satisfy the hydro syst=
em's ESA obligations.  While the administration has said it plans to double=
 past expenditures to implement the BiOp, nobody at the meeting could come =
up with just what the previous BiOp costs were - for now, the salmon plan i=
s pure lip service.

Smelter Curtailments
Kaiser: Faced with declining aluminum prices, which have decreased 9% from =
last year, Kaiser is in a difficult position due to the fact that they are =
maintaining a level of infrastructure and personnel-readiness which will al=
low them to restart 4-3/4's lines of their operations on the fly.  Should t=
his curtailment last longer than a year, it would be cost-prohibitive for t=
hem to continue incurring that infrastructure expense.  Kaiser has gone on =
the record to say it is still open to signing load a curtailment agreement =
with BPA, but it is unclear at this time whether BPA foresees a benefit in =
signing an agreement considering short-term and perceived mid-term electric=
ity price decreases.  We are continuing to monitor this situation as it dev=
elops, although an agreement in the short-term seems doubtful.

Alcoa: Recently mentioned in the press, Canada's Newfoundland government an=
d U.S. aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. announced Thursday they would conduct a fe=
asibility study to possibly revive the stalled Lower Churchill hydroelectri=
c project in the remote Labrador region.  The generating station on Gull Is=
land could produce up to 2,000 MW of electricity.  Costs of the project are=
 estimated at some C$4 billion ($2.6 billion), far below the C$10 billion o=
riginally thought.  With a 16% drop in net income due to slackening global =
aluminum demand and higher energy prices, Alcoa has suffered along with the=
 rest of the aluminum industry to find cheaper, less volatile sources of el=
ectricity.  Along with their ongoing negotiations with BC Hydro, it appears=
 Alcoa is making a determined push to work with the Canadians to play all s=
ides of a competitive electricity market.

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

Executive Summary
-CPUC rules that SoCal must pay 15% of debt to QFs (approximately $50 million)
-Ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by SoCal
-Voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring-fencing by EIX parent
-Bankruptcy judge firm in support for QFs

Report

1.	SoCal Loses CPUC Ruling, But Retains Appeal Option

As you may have seen, Bloomberg reported that the CPUC voted 5-0 to force SoCal to make 15% of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in California.  CPUC rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings, leaving a window open for SoCal to buy more time.  

2.	Voluntary Filing In?

With regard to a SoCal bankruptcy filing, the key now is how SoCal's board
feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors.  In other words,
sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary
filing.  A continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the
number of liens filed against SoCal is more likely to make the SoCal board
want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily.  The recent ring-fencing by Edison 
International reflects their need to pay off cross-default risk and to cut ties
in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by SoCal.
 In and of outself, it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing.

3.	Involuntary Out?

Sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not
considering a filing against SoCal.  This is because the financial creditors
believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy.  Sources report
that in creditor discussions, there has not been talk of the debt holders
not being paid.  "People have talked about screwing the generators and
everyone else, but not the debt holders," a source commented.

The QFs are unlikely to file against SoCal because they have fairly good
contracts in place.  Also, they receive high capacity fees in the summer
(these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees).  These
capacity fees are calculated on a rolling, 4-year basis and will be
re-calculated next year.  The QFs want this summer included in the
recalculation, incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place.

4.	Montali Supporting QFs

Judge Montali, by his recent rulings, is sending a signal that he is
concerned for the QFs and is sensitive to their hardships.  He is trying to
help them through his rulings.  For example, as long as QFs remain on line,
those who petition can receive additional payments from PG&E.  Over a
4-month period, these payments equal 20% of the QFs' pre-petition claims.
This provides the QFs incentive to remain connected to PG&E.

5.	GE Looking to Restructure Generating Capacity Financing

General Electric is reportedly "deeply concerned" about the stability of
financing generating capacity in the US.  (GE has over 70% of the gas
turbine market.)  GE is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is
not raising its prices due to concerns about instability.  Sources believe
that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will
have to be restrucured in five years.

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:Part 2:  PUC Approves Edison Bailout

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

US Treasury Sec'y O'Neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the Hill debates (trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long-term costs for the budgets several years out).    It will continue to be a delicate balance, as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year.  

Fed Chair Greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee: his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at, it should be primarily temporary in character.  His preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty.  

Competitive Analysis will continue to follow this issue closely and welcomes feedback and further specific questions on the issues below.  Please contact Brendan Fitzsimmons at x5-4763 with further questions.

HILL STIMULUS BILL UPDATE: 10/16/01

Partisanship is the Question for Senate Battle: Final Stimulus Bill Likely in the $80-110B Range, but Hill Dems' and Repubs' aims could push it northward

SUMMARY
Senate numbers look set to exceed Bush figures ($60-75B), may approach House Ways and Means $100B; final conferenced bill could hit $140B; all on this on top of the special $55B approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas
Republican plan, so far, all tax cuts and no spending
Democratic plan has a lot more spending, but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure
Final, conferenced bill may run as high as $140B if the 'neglected' middle-class is given another rebate check (up to another $38B)
One major question hanging over size, composition and speed of the Senate package is whether Senate Maj. Leader Daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan Senate package that tries to isolate the House Republicans and their business tax cutting agenda
Daschle will present dilemma to President Bush and his senior advisers. "We will tell the president that we need assurance from the White House that compromises we make will be supported by the White House. If Bush can't give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position."

REPORT
The centrifugal pull of a big number like $100B proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front.  House Ways and Means Committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number.  The Senate will produce something a little smaller, but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of Congress move toward a Conference Committee package that could easily top that total.

One key member of the Senate negotiations told sources late Sunday: "We are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later.  Right now we are still aiming to stay in Bush's $60B to $75B bracket, but everyone knows the final number will go up from there."
 
Although Senate process is controlled by Democrats, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus (Dem) is in a highly contested re-election campaign next year in a deeply Republican state.  Just as he did with the earlier Bush tax cut plan, you can expect him to reach out to work with senior Republicans (such as Grassley) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership.

Likely elements of the Democratic Senate package:
Rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $300 or $600 rebate. This was also in the House Republican package.
Temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30% - but they will keep it to one year.
Some form of extending the loss-carryback for businesses and allowing one-year use of AMT credits in 2002. The loss-carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10-year costs. For Democrats AMT is more complicated. (see below)
Some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks, but other elements to expand who is eligible.
50% rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the COBRA program.
 
Partisanship Question: 
There are a series of senior Democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since House Republicans will simply "pocket the concessions we make toward Republican-style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee." In other words, does Daschle position the Senate Democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position Democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month.
 
Looking forward to the final, conferenced bill:
Sorting through various proposals, sources suggest a possible solution agenda:
Rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers
30% expensing for 12 months (maybe compromise of 18 months)
Five year net-loss carry back Unemployment insurance extension and some expansion -- maybe through help directly to states (more Rep. Governors may like that) and some COBRA assistance.
Repeal of Corporate AMT (or several-year suspension) as concessions to House Republicans (Dems go along but say it will be a big mistake)
Odds and Ends from Appropriators (energy assistance, food assistance, etc)

All of this comes to around $100 billion.  Although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward, there is one major decision to be made that could add another $40 billion to the total (bringing the final stimulus package to something like $120-$140B): More Rebate Checks

Both House and Senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes (that's the bottom 34 million).   But it would be highly unlike this - or any - Congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20% and the top 2% (through major business tax cuts), but left the 75% in the middle out of the equation entirely.  One solution could be to send another rebate to everyone: another $38B

California's power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.  Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California's current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand.  California's economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result, predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state's regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California's problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.  Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned the state's policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which, if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron's Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

?	Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers.
?	As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from the problems the states' utilities, and their customers, now face.  We protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a "turnback" of our customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

?	As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES's market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
?	EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
?	EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets.  Enron's primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California's crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state's utilities.

Increasing Supply

California's process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.  They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State's Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don't work; have never worked; and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media, it's important for you to know this:  We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state.

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

Negotiations between Governor Davis and California utilities may be faltering:

Negotiations between Governor Gray Davis and California's three major utilities appear to be taking a significant turn.  Sources report that the proposal by Governor Davis that was splashed in the press this morning is reported to have been rejected by PG&E, and SoCal Ed.  The proposal to purchase debt ridden utilities' transmission lines was outlined in SB33x 

The Governor is expected to revise SB33X and approach the utilities with the following new terms:
		
		1)  Raise the states transmission pruchase bid from $3.5 billion to roughly $6 billion
		
		2)  Finance a $9 to $12 billion payment for the utilities' under-collected debt to generators 	

		3)   Allow the utilities to issue 15 year bonds to repay the state, resulting in surcharges on consumer utility bills.

Consumer groups led by Harvey Rosenfield could provide strong opposition to Davis' plan and it is possible Rosenfield could launch a referendum to kill the bill.

Davis is scheduled to give a press conference today and 2:00 pm (Pac. Time) to comment on negotiations.

1.=09Bankruptcy An Increasingly Attractive Option for Davis

Despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching nor=
mal levels after a month of torrential storms, back at the poker table in S=
acramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy. Indeed, almos=
t any reading of Governor Gray Davis's political situation after the shock =
LA Federal Court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his bes=
t bet. At least one of the three major power generators (PG&E) seems to agr=
ee that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now, partic=
ularly after yesterday's FERC ruling that it is okay for the company to shi=
ft assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy.=20

2.=09Davis Wants To Keep Hope Alive Until Analyst Meetings Next Week

Today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since Davis =
wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the National Gov=
ernor's Association and meet with Wall Street analysts Tuesday and Wednesda=
y. In fact, Davis's desire to have something definitive to say next week is=
 the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in California. A=
ccording to talks with all sides, Davis has offered to buy the electricity =
grid from the three largest power producers (PG&E, SoCal Edison and San Die=
go) for something like $7 billion that they could use to pay off most of th=
e money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate she=
lls.=20

But the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to =
be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wonderin=
g whether Davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situati=
on where he has court-ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he know=
s are necessary, but politically difficult. According to key Sacramento off=
icials, "Confidence continues to wane in Davis' ability to do this. The pla=
in fact is the stick he's carrying isn't awfully big." Adds another: "The k=
ey people here just think the utilities are playing him. Either they're pla=
ying him, or he's going to roll on the price, he's going to pay double what=
 the transmission assets are worth. The utilities got away with the same ki=
nd of thing before, in 1996 of course." Davis is more astute than that, and=
 a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that =
has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in Los Angeles.=
=20

3.=09Little Support for Transmission Assets Deal

The transmission assets deal doesn't look attractive for anyone.=20
Davis has no particular affinity for it, having adopted State Senator Burto=
n's proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade.=20
The legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry, an=
d concerned about the vast investment needed in the network.=20
The utilities -- PG&E in particular don't want to sell.

4.=09Accounting Ambiguities Appear; State Offers Only Tepid Support for Bon=
d Scheme

"There are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility account=
ing methods which the audits didn't pick up" says one California official. =
"The way they calculate depreciation is very strange. If the accounts were =
done on a proper GAAP basis instead of some kind of FERC basis they would l=
ook different." Even if the deal goes through, the financing could be diffi=
cult and very expensive. The state has definitively ruled out putting the f=
ull faith and credit of the state of California behind the proposed bonds. =
State Treasurer Angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they'd qual=
ify for tax-exempt status.=20

5.=09Small IPP Players Furious

And while the big players talk, there is increasing nervousness among small=
 independent and alternative generators. The small companies have been the =
biggest losers so far -- their representative, Jan Smutny-Jones, was tossed=
 off the Board of the California ISO, and the closing of the California PX =
deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power. The CEOs of la=
rge companies like Dynegy and Reliant are talking to Davis on a daily basis=
, but the small companies are out of the loop. They also lack the financial=
 resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long. Lar=
ge companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential p=
olitical and relationship risks across the US if they get cast in the role =
of villain in California. For the small companies, however, it is a matter =
of survival. Some legislators in Sacramento are operating under the assumpt=
ion that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to forc=
e bankruptcy. Not so. All it takes is three creditors owed at least $11,000=
 each to apply for bankruptcy. Two small companies, Cal Energy and Ridgewoo=
d Power, are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment.=
=20

If bankruptcy is triggered, there is immense uncertainty about what would h=
appen. No major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome=
, especially after the shock of Judge Lew's unexpected ruling in Los Angele=
s. It is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the =
State Supreme Court. FERC and the Federal government could also be ensnared=
 as writs fly. But to many of the players, that uncertain mess following ba=
nkruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal.

I only have a hard copy but I am faxing one to Jim Steffes.  Here is the relevant language.

p. 4:  "The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should be suspended effective September 1."

There will be no hearing (p.6) "...we are simply implementing a clearly worded statue (sic) that directs the Commission to suspend direct access."

p.7 Findings of Fact
"3.  The right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective September 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to September 1, 2001."

p. 7, Conclusions of Law
"2. The right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective September 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to September 1, 2001."

Also some rhetoric (p. 6): "This is the time when large customers might be tempted to switch from utility bundled service to energy service providers in order to avoid some of the impact of higher rates ... This is precisely the wrong time to encourage such behavior."

p.5 It also states that it will not address the payment of PX credits -- and has bifurcated the issue from this order.

FERC Acts to Impose Temporary Price Caps in West

*	QUICK COMMENTARY; ELABORATION PLANNED IN A LATER NOTE
*	Late last night the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")
acted to impose "temporary" wholesale power price caps in the western United
States.
*	The cap affects the "real-time" market, which we estimate is only 5%
of the total wholesale market; it is set to expire in one year from May 1
*	This is a near-term negative for Power Producers and Energy
Merchants, a dramatic example of "headline risk". The political risk of
re-regulation has stepped up, in our view, reducing the multiple investors
will pay for earnings
*	In terms of earnings, ironically, the effect may be somewhat
positive, albeit small (only 5% of market is affected). Caps are likely to
increase volatility, benefiting Energy Merchants, and sustain high power
prices for a longer period of time, benefiting Power Producers, by reducing
the incentive to build new plants.

Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzberg's chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly.  He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento.  See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill:

A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today.
With respect to DA, the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill.
Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard, explaining that, since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through "exit fees," there is no reason to suspend DA. 
The Governor is resisting hard, stating that "he wants time for the market to stabilize."
So it looks like the Governor's plan is to 1) have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of 1.1.03 and 2) have the PUC "temporarily suspend" DA from September 1 to 1.1.03.
We're continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate, or significantly shorten, the suspension.
The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August 23, 2001 (yesterday) will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts.  The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs' behalf between Jan 17 and the date of the switch.
The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept 1 be responsible for DWR going forward contracts (though details of how that would work were not clear).
The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August 23rd date is to prevent a "rush" to Direct Access between now and Sept 1.
There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept 1.
Finally, the bill apparently will also give self-generation priority over Direct Access in each "open season." The bill would set aside 250 MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen.  If the self gen is not subscribed, the MWs would go to DA.
The bill, including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues, is supposed to be released today.
The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon.
We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions.
It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly.  
The politicians are very reluctant to pass any "Edison bail out bill" and the political pressure not to vote on any "bailout" is significant and growing.  But the Governor is working the bill very hard.
Mirant is actively working against the bill.  
Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a "bailout" could lose re-election.  Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes.
The bill also has to make it through the Senate.  Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President, John Burton, who said flatly that "he's not doing anything."  But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session, and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is 50-50.
With respect to the bill's provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the "dedicated rate component" included,  Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers.  Edison also said that, under the Assembly version of the bill, Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds.

More info to follow as it becomes available.  If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access --08.22.01

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

	The following are the two deals that were presented at the RAC meeting last week, and should be communicated to Government Affairs:
1.
Region:  EWS/EA/East Power

Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--08.27.01

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09Senator Keeley Spearheads a New "Plan B"
?=09State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective "Plan B"
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed=
 out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan "as =
soon as possible"; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is n=
ot this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republi=
cans were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so th=
ey developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  H=
owever, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough Repub=
lican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much tough=
er fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be =
able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people w=
ho would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.=
  Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez "Plan B's," Keeley's=
 new plan is said to:
?=09Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their =
undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to "high-end =
customers."  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who wo=
uld not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate co=
mponent is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to =
12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate compone=
nt for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B t=
hat will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional=
 dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough t=
o cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forwar=
d purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation=
 should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key ques=
tion becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of power =
is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to continue =
operating.
?=09The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission a=
ssets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan w=
ould be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return o=
n the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an=
 incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it=
 would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, t=
he value would be credited toward the loan.
?=09In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the=
 filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native po=
wer generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would ha=
ve to pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for d=
irect access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the=
 constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go fo=
rward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that=
 the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollec=
t.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transm=
ission assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets =
would become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constit=
utional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding "Plan B" and t=
he legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering Ke=
eley's "Plan B" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the=
 Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of bankrup=
tcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking seriously abo=
ut purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans remain strongl=
y opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of PG&E (except fo=
r the transmission assets, which it would retain).

Executive Summary:
?	Situation "confused" but filing probably postponed until Monday
?	Could be sooner if negotiations completely collapse, or if commercial paper holders file pre-emptively to the QFs
?	QFs pressuring legislature for rate hikes, in-state generators negotiating with FERC
?	Davis's proposed CPUC payment to QFs would require legislative approval--tough to get before Friday
?	Absent rate hikes, bankruptcy filing against Edison is still best option for QFs- doubts about gas supply contracts and market value of Davis' price proposals

1.	Situation Confused, But Bankruptcy Unlikely Before Monday
The situation in California is described as "confused" due to the flurry of activity by the governor over the last twenty-four hours.  It seems likely that this state of confusion will serve to forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing until next week, when the situation should become clearer.  

2.	Earlier Bankruptcy Possible If....
Sources believe that two events could change this and precipitate an "immediate" filing:  1) a breakdown in negotiations between the governor and the QFs and 2) a PUC order to pay the QFs $1 billion, which would be seen as a preference payment and cause the commercial paper holders to file an involuntary bankruptcy.

3.	QFs Negotiating With Davis, In-State Generators Talking to FERC
Sources report that the QFs are currently either meeting with their lawyers are involved in negotiations with the governor's people and the legislature.  They are reportedly "working on Keeley," since he has actually suggested openly that there needs to be a rate increase.

Sources report that the in-state merchant generators are occupied today with preparing reports for the FERC.  The FERC has made demands that the generators report to them on market conditions, etc. that have governed their reactions.  The reports are due tomorrow.  Sources indicate that FERC has placed these demands to placate the California delegation and to "give the appearance of concern" for the situation in California.  Note, however, that the FERC did not make similar demands on out-of-state generators.

4.	$1 Billion Payment to QFs Requires Legislative Approval, Could Trigger Filing by Commercial Paper Holders
Sources report that the governor continues to focus on trying to get a $1 billion payment made to the QFs to forestall a bankruptcy filing.  He is trying to get the legislature to grant the PUC the authority to order this payment.  This is in spite of the fact that such a payment would be seen by commercial paper holders as a preference payment, and that the money might have to be returned in the event of a bankruptcy filing.  Such an order by the PUC would likely precipitate an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the commercial paper holders.

5.	Why is Involuntary Bankruptcy Still Attractive for the QFs?
Davis/CAPUC plan does not incorporate payments on existing debt and requires a less than "market standard" price concession from the QFs ($75MW 5yrs, $69 MW for ten years).  Current spot market power prices in the West far exceed these values.  QFs who are already off-line have no need to worry about "pre-payments" or future payments for power; they just want payment for the power they have provided.

The key weakness in this proposed plan is the inability of the QFs to fix their costs going forward.  Their biggest cost is natural gas.  The natural gas supply contracts are between the utilities and gas providers.  It would be up to the utilities to fulfill the terms of the contracts.  It does not appear reasonable that a natural gas supplier would enter into a 5- or 10-year gas supply contract with PG&E or SoCal, since in the even of a bankruptcy these contracts could be rejected.  The utilities remain a credit risk.  Unless the price of natural gas is fixed, the QFs cannot enter into 5- or 10-year power contracts at these prices.

Moreover, gas price volatility is expected to increase rather than decrease.  Some sort of state support is needed to fix the gas supply contracts, and there has been no indication that the state is willing to make this sort of commitment.  The state legislature does not seem willing to assume more risk at this point.

On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

?	The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, this is "locked in to pass."  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on Monday.
 
?	The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to either operate unprofitably or shut down.
 
?	The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as "extremely aggressive." 
 
?	An involuntary bankruptcy filing appears imminent.   Sources believes the trigger event will either be the legislative passage of the plan  tomorrow or the PUC order implementing the plan on Monday.

Executive Summary:

The likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60%.  This is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below, but also because the 30-day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week, increasing the likelihood that their IPP creditors will act against them.  If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly. 

1.	Utilities vs. CPUC

Governor Davis' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed.  The case will come before the judge on Monday, February 12th.  The federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities.  However, the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ($.01/kwh).  This will be left to an appellate court.  The decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, by the smaller IPPs (as noted in our reports last week) or by larger out-of-state generators such as Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy (as noted in the press this morning).  This is expected next week or the week after.

2.	Prospects for a Bailout

Bill AB 18X is effectively dead from lack of support.

Senator Burton, despite his public refusals, is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail-out.  The statements by Burton and the CA State Treasurer are merely a negotiating position.  They are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear.  For Burton, this is because of his long association with labor unions; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy.

Burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him.  The deal Burton is expected to arrange would be for:

Bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state, but with some kind of state support (but less than "full faith and credit of the state of CA," which would not pass).  This would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills (e.g. $.01, though the actual amount is not known).  These bonds would be asset-backed securities, with payment receivable from rate payers.  The term of these bonds is unknown; if the term is made quite long (e.g. 20 years), the associated rate increase could be very small.
The state would purchase the utilities' transmission assets for a very high price.  The amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled.

If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), sources believe that this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly.  As noted in an earlier report, the California legislature habitually does not act until things "hit the wall."

It is expected that the Republicans in the legislature will follow Burton's lead and support the bail-out plan.  The Assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature.  One moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail-out in her Central Valley district is "50 to 1."   However, an involuntary filing (or the threat thereof) may be enough to trigger legislative support.  It would allow the argument of an "imminent threat" to the people of the state of California.

3.	Consumer Opposition

Harvey Rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum.  If the referendum fails, he intends to attack individual legislators (though not John Burton, who reportedly has "immunity" from Rosenfield).

Some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail-out plan, then supporting a referendum from Rosenfield later.  However, if the bail-out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill (rather than put in place by the PUC, for example), it cannot be reversed by a referendum.  As additional insurance against Rosenfield, by supporting the bonds issued under the plan, the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan.  While it is not clear that this is a factual argument, it still might impede any referendum.

Today we negotiated a handshake agreement with Smith Properties to buy out JEDI's position in Inland for $2 million ($1 million net to Enron).  The DASH minimum was $1.25 million ($612,500 net to Enron), the original offer.  Documentation will be simple:  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it.  Expect to close and fund next week.

Given the Inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred, I view this outcome as very favorable.

Brandi Morris' work on this transaction was outstanding.

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=
 dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	DWR Contracts Being Negotiated
?	California Legislature Comment on Plan B

Long Term Contracts
Sources report that the state's lawyers are currently examining how to break the recently negotiated long term power contracts.  Assemblyman Fred Keeley has directed his staff to go through and look for any loopholes and sources also believe that the state is looking for ways to "hold the generators to the contracts they want to keep, but break those contracts that they want to break."

Sources gathered the following information on Plan B through private interviews with California legislatures Sen. John Burton and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg.  
Speaker Robert Hertzberg:
?	Speaker Hertzberg has spent most of his time lately on the budget, but continues to make efforts related to the Plan  B.  Hertzberg is very aware how unlikely it is that he will succeed in putting any plan through the  legislature, particularly the Senate.  (He believes it will be possible to put a Plan B through the Assembly).
?	Hertzberg is personally committed to at least attempting to put a Plan B  through the legislature.  This is because he is close to business and wants to see SoCal saved.  He "wants a win under his belt before he leaves the Senate next year" so that he can take that win into whatever he does next.   Davis has laid the burden of bailing out SoCal on Hertzberg.  Hertzberg is determined  to put a piece of legislation on the floor.  However, he does not, at this time, know when this will happen, nor does he know what the share of the dedicated rate component will be for businesses and ratepayers, which remains a key sticking point.
?	When asked about Plan B's chances of passing the Senate, Hertzberg responded  that, "miracles can happen."
?	Hertzberg defended his idea of setting aside a  trust as part of Plan B for the generators to litigate over.  He stated  that his bankruptcy attorney believes that it will work, despite what Goode (the  governor's attorney) has said.
 
Sen. John Burton:
?	Burton is aware that Hertzberg is trying  to put together Plan B legislation and when asked about Hertzberg's efforts, Burton stated that in the Senate "Plan B has no Republican votes, and there are, at a minimum, 6 Democrats that will vote against it."   Burton said that for a Plan B bailout to pass the Senate, it would have to have three elements:
?	Businesses would pay the entire dedicated rate component.
?	The Edison parent company would have to give the state $1 B.
?	ALL creditors would have to  take a 30% haircut.
?	Burton wants Senator Bowen to hold hearings on the Plan B that will run for at least 3 days,  then have a "long caucus."  At that point the Senate will either "hold an  up-or-down vote on whatever comes from the Assembly or add amendments [stating the three provisions above]."  Burton wants "all Senators to know exactly what they're voting for or against."
?	Burton stated that he would "bet against" a Plan B passing. "This is not gonna happen," he stated. Burton believes that a bailout deal would be bad for the Democratic Party.

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at "essential public services" the increase in DG is expected from "clean" sources, not diesel emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for "clean" sources of generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will get back to you asap with further information.

The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

?	Hertzberg and Keeley announced that they are filing a petition with FERC to rehear the April 26th decision regarding price caps.  After going to D.C. and meeting with several FERC members, they decided to file for a rehearing.  Their filing asks that the order should be in affect around the clock instead of just during Stage 1, that the actual costs be tied closer to the pricing of the product, and anyone that exceeding the cost-based pricing system have a 100% penalty.

?	Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that he was getting to the point where CA "may just say no to prices that are too high" (via buyer cartel).

FYI.  Fairly accurate account of the activities in California.   Assembly released new version of Hertzberg's bill late last night.  Another update to follow shortly.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau 
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL  
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Subject:=09RTO Orders - Grid South, SE Trans, SPP and Entergy

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp=
ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s=
atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Com=
mission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it=
s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf=
iguration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la=
ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they=
 failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or =
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order s=
tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi=
ssion organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates t=
hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requir=
es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis
By Michael B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.

John & Louise --

I wanted to make sure that you were aware that FERC has ordered natural gas sellers to provide monthly reporting for transactions relating to California.  We are, of course, seeking for FERC to modify its decision.  Given the politics surrounding California energy markets, it is unlikely that FERC remove in whole the reporting obligation.  Govt Affairs has talked with the West gas team about this new obligation and how we respond.

If you have any questions, please call.

Jim

Subject:	Please Reply by Wednesday, 8/22 -- Draft Rehearing Request -- FERC Reporting Requirements for California Sales

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).  
 

Thanks.

Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing.


In the Senate:
SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts
In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.  
The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of DWR contracts.
The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the DWR contracts.
The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or end, Direct Access.
Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to substantial damages.
As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, its chances of passage there are low.
SB72XX---The Senate's MOU
The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50.
The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and leadership is awesome.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX)
The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82XX).
Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly Republicans.
In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed.
As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMRAY
?	CPUC Settles Filed Rate Doctrine Case with SoCal
?	CPUC Kills DWR Rate Agreement, Davis May Reconsider Old Senate Bill
  

CPUC - SoCal Suit
In a closed hearing today, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 5-0 to settle its filed rate doctrine case with SoCal Edison.  The implications could save SoCal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy, though bankruptcy remains a real threat.  Under the agreement, the CPUC has stipulated the following points, which have not yet been formalized by Administrative Law Judge, Ronald Lew:

?	The CPUC agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for SoCal to pay off under-collect through 2003.

?	All surplus revenue (revenue above O & M) generated from any source must be applied to SoCal's back debt.

?	SoCal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until 2003, or until all back debt has been recovered.  If SoCal's debt has not been recovered by 2003, the CPUC will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for SoCal to recover its debt through 2004.  Dividend payouts on SoCal common stock will be subject to CPUC approval during this extension.

?	100% of any revenue SoCal receives/generates from FERC/generator refunds will be applied to SoCal's debt.

?	Once SoCal's back debt has been recovered, any surplus revenue generated from the CPUC rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers.

CPUC - DWR Rate Agreement
The fact that the PUC voted down the DWR rate agreement (by a 4-1 margin) puts Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides in a very awkward position.  This leaves Senator Burton's bill, SB 18XX, as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the General Fund.
 
However, as late as this morning, Governor Davis vowed (through his spokesman) that SB 18XX was "dead on arrival" and would be vetoed.  This move by the PUC puts pressure on Davis to sign SB 18XX in order to protect the bonds and the long-term power contacts he has negotiated.
 
However, 18XX violates the terms of a number of the long-term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year.  For example:
 
?	SB 18XX splits the revenue streams for payment of the General Fund's revenue bonds and payment to the DWR for power.  It clarifies the funds that will go to repay the General Fund, but is much less clear on the funds to pay the DWR for power.  SB 18XX leaves the long-term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do.

?	SB 18XX also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with Shearson Lehman earlier this year.  The terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18XX is passed, the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state.  These terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his DWR rate agreement rather than Burton's.  Of course, this effort failed when the legislature easily passed SB 18XX.  Today's PUC action further complicates the situation.
 
While on the surface this would seem to force the governor's hand into signing SB 18XX, that may not, in fact, happen.  It would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto SB 18XX, then force either the legislature or the PUC to "play ball" with him in order to repay the General Fund.  Thus, another leverage point has been created.  We will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of Davis signing or vetoing SB 18XX.

Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occur=
ed with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest ver=
sion of an "Edison MOU":

The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet=
 that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen unti=
l they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether=
 they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
>From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it=
 appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal:
Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be pres=
sured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance)
Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with sma=
ll customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's =
transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider b=
uying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly)
Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but=
 place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed t=
o suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provision=
s.)
Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to =
the one created in Texas).
The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill=
 passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the ne=
w version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newe=
st proposal.
If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficul=
t time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate =
has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the As=
sembly version.
Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for =
recess as soon as we hear.

Best,
Jeff

The US Supreme Court has decided to hear arguments over the Native Load exception - one of our key policy questions.  While the answer is still many months away, this is a critical decision for Enron.

We will keep everyone apprised of developments.

Court Weighs U.S. Power Over Utilities 
( February 26, 2001 ) 


WASHINGTON, Feb 26, 2001 (United Press International via COMTEX) -- In a case that could prove pivotal for energy competition, the Supreme Court said Monday it would hear argument next term on whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can regulate the transmission of electricity within a state. 

      At issue is whether FERC regulations can foster competition in the local electricity marketplace. But the case also tests whether the Supreme Court will continue enhancing state power at the expense of the federal government, as it has in a number of decisions in recent years. 

      And far from being a dusty exercise in legal maneuvering, the case is also just one more example of how the actions of the Supreme Court can affect the average American. 

      The financial stakes are huge for the suppliers and distributors of electricity, but the dispute also could have a direct influence on how much consumers pay for electricity. Though California is not a party in the case, the energy crisis in that state and its ramifications in neighboring states have brought concern over electric utilities to the forefront. 

      The Federal Power Act of 1935 gave the federal government the authority to regulate interstate transmission of energy, but largely left an individual state in charge when it came to the energy transmission within that state's borders. In 1935, "most electric facilities were intrastate facilities" operating within a particular state's borders, New York told the Supreme Court in a petition. 

      In 1998, however, "FERC pre-empted state regulation of both the delivery of electricity from a generator to a retail consumer in the same state and the use of local distribution facilities to deliver electricity that is resold," New York representatives said. "FERC envisioned the introduction of competition, not only in its jurisdictional (wholesale) market...but also in the state jurisdictional retail market, and concluded that competition allowed it to expand its jurisdiction in three areas." 

      First, FERC asserted its jurisdiction over retail transactions when states "unbundled," or separated, retail rates into charges for delivery and electricity. Second, "FERC decided that if a seller of unbundled wholesale energy made use of a local distribution system, FERC -- not the states -- would set the rates that the seller would pay for the use of those...facilities," New York said. 

      Third, FERC pre-empted the state's authority to set rates to recoup the costs "incurred by utilities to serve retail customers, that may be 'stranded' (unrecoverable by utilities) due to competition," the state said. 

      The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit consolidated scores of challenges to the new regulations, including those from nine state commissions, and last June upheld all of FERC's actions. 

      Several losing parties, including New York, then asked the Supreme Court for a review. Monday, the justices combined the New York case with one brought by energy giant Enron Power Marketing and agreed to hear the case sometime next term. 

      In its own brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of FERC, the Justice Department said a section of the Federal Energy Act "explicitly gives FERC jurisdiction over 'all transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce' and 'all facilities for such transmission' regardless of whether the transmission is part of a wholesale or retail transaction." 

      Besides, the department argued, a distinction between interstate and intrastate energy may be meaningless. 

      In a 1972 ruling, FPC vs. Florida Light & Power, the Supreme Court "recognized that when a utility's transmission lines connect to an interstate grid, the utility's energy commingles with that of other utilities so that inevitably some energy is transmitted across state lines and becomes interstate in nature," the department said. 

      The states have argued that they will not "unbundle" the retail sale of energy into the categories of delivery and actual electricity delivered -- a measure designed to help reduce prices for consumers -- "for fear of losing jurisdiction over transmissions associated with retail transactions." FERC's actions therefore actually undermine competition, not foster it, according to the states. 

      In its brief, the Justice Department brushed aside such criticism, saying the argument "assumes that states will not weigh their consumers best interests in deciding for, or against, retail wheeling, but will be concerned only with protecting their own jurisdiction." 

      Though not yet scheduled, the case will probably be heard sometime next fall. 

      (Nos. 00-568, New York et al vs. FERC et al; and 00-809, Enron vs. FERC)

Here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between Socal and the State for the transmission lines:

?	The deal may be enough to save Socal from bankruptcy.  This will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon Socal can receive a positive cash flow.
?	We are not sure if the State can really do a deal without PG&E or a deal for whole grid.  It was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without PG&E.  This may still be the case; the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of PG&E's assets.  A generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on PG&E's lines quickly.  However, bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner.  In most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings, have competitive bids, etc.
?	This purchase would need legislative approval, which is not guaranteed.  Previously the plan was for the state to purchase SCE's and PG&E's assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves.  Now they would have to purchase SCE's lines, but still finance power purchases because of PG&E.  Additionally, it is possible that Socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price.  If this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval.
?	The purchase would also need FERC approval.  As stated before, if FERC approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for California.

Done without much fanfare, except by Commissoner Wood, who continued his vitriolic attack on DA and took on green choice as "fraudulent." The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today. The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.  There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties "on notice" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001. Our attorneys are reviewing this, but on first blush, our California attorney says the CPUC would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of DA.

Confidential Information

?	One of our source has reported that Socal has started to "ring-fence some assets."  As reported earlier, this is a sign that they are starting to protect themselves in case of a bankruptcy.  PG&E started this activity a week prior to their announcement of involuntary bankruptcy.  As the MOU and other Plan Bs fall apart, the chances of a Socal bankruptcy increases.

The following information was provided by a source who meet with senior White House members earlier today:

Price Caps
?	The White House is taking an extremely tough line on price caps.  They are well aware of the Congressional pressure on price caps but are determined to resist.

California
?	They feel Davis made a serious blunder when he initiated a court case against price caps.  They commented, "he'll lose it, and he's made it the Court's doing, not the administrations."  The White House is not considering, at this time, any type of relief orders for the Northwest.  
?	They do believe the existing price mitigation plan is working, "to some extent."
?	The White House believes SoCal is very close to bankruptcy, it is just a matter of time.

FERC
?	The White House is not thinking of replacing Hebert as Chairman of FERC.  Their response was, "why would we?  Wood toes the same line so why bother changing."

Subject:	PUC Votes to Suspend Direct Access  Effective September 20th, But Continues to Hold Out Threat of Retroactivity

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

Below is the weekly western issues update sent to Tim earlier.  If you have=
 any questions, please feel free to Kristin Walsh (x39510).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FERC Multi-Party Refund Negotiations
BPA Financials & Smelter Agreements
BC Hydro Rate Freeze

Power Refunds
The big event that happened last week in Washington DC, in regards to Calif=
ornia and the rest of the Western energy markets, was that multi-party nego=
tiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $8.9 billion and =
$703.6 million between parties could not be settled.  Below is a rough brea=
kdown corporate offerings:

Williams, Duke, Reliant, Dynegy, & Mirant: =09 =09 $510 million combined
PowerEx (BC Hydro):=09=09=09        =09 $125 million
15 Power Marketers including Enron:=09=09 $49.6 million
7 California Municipal Utilities:=09=09=09 $6.5 million
Load-serving entities outside CA:=09=09=09 $12.5 million

Northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges, however, J=
udge Curtis Wagner has virtually ignored Northwest claims of $611 million i=
n overcharges, stating "There was little time to address the issues raised =
by the Pacific Northwest parties.  They did not have data on what they are =
owed, nor an amount of refunds due them."  Contrary to the judge's claim, a=
 number of Northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement c=
onference, although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for=
 calculating these amounts.  Wagner was probably frustrated that there was =
no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning ag=
ainst giving NW utilities the same fast-track status as California.  FERC h=
ad originally not even wanted to consider NW claims in this conference unti=
l a group of NW senators got together and applied some pressure - the resul=
t was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together.  Below i=
s another rough breakdown of the claims:
PacificCorp:=09=09$6.7 million
Snohomish PUD:=09=09$229 million
Tacoma Power:=09=09$71.9 million
Seattle City Light:=09=09$222 million
Port of Seattle:=09=09$11.1 million
BPA:=09=09=09$70 million*

BPA
BPA Borrowing:  Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) has been leading the fight for BPA=
's request of $2B in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the Sen=
ate voted to increase access to additional funds, however,  Sen. Murray has=
 promised to fight the re-authorization caveat. Murray's spokesman said the=
 Committee may have been concerned about 'bumping up against spending caps'=
 when it added the mandate for annual re-authorization.  Bonneville has war=
ned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the =
amount was boosted from the current limit of $3.75 billion -- the increase =
got through the Senate Energy & Water Development Subcommittee, but had the=
 caveat added when it reached the full Appropriations Committee.  Increased=
 borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure, r=
etrofit Columbia River hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue=
 conservation programs.  We can expect to see more action coming out of Sen=
. Murray's office.
Refunds:  Recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of Northwest =
utilities (including BPA) seeking refunds for the overpriced power Californ=
ia is currently fighting. This information seems supported by fears that ea=
rlier settlements reached between Northwest utilities and California State =
may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings.  If a bankruptcy court were to=
 issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between BPA and PG&E =
(& potentially bankrupt SoCal. Ed.), it is possible that BPA could press a =
refund request in the range of $70M to $100M.  However, while BPA's refund =
request may be an option to stabilize their finances, they are also careful=
 about voicing their opinion because of the $167 million in gross sales the=
y made from California
BPA Administration:  The Bush Administration reportedly has no current plan=
s to replace the BPA's administrator.  The entire Northwest delegation (Dem=
ocrats and Republicans from the BPA region) has asked that he be made the f=
ull-time administrator.  However, since many of the decision-makers at DOE =
are conservative Republicans, they're not comfortable with him because he i=
s a Democrat.  At this time, DOE people are unsure of how to handle this ma=
tter and appear to be in a state of limbo.
DSI/Aluminum Smelter - Load Reduction Agreements:  BPA is in the hot seat r=
ight now, realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible f=
or smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for ot=
her sources.  Few believe that these current market prices will be sustaina=
ble, considering the fact that the West will see a significant supply incre=
ase within the next year.  Consequently, DSI's will be very concerned about=
 signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on p=
rices (which are still historically very high, but dropping).  Currently, t=
here are two Northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations.   Alco=
a is in preliminary talks with BC Hydro to secure additional power to resta=
rt its Intalco smelter, and Kaiser, free from the money and the constraints=
 of a load-reduction agreement, is also attempting to restart plants.  We w=
ill continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story de=
velops.
=20
BC HYDRO
Rate Freeze:  The current rate freeze was imposed by the former NDP governm=
ent, and it ends 30 September 2001.  It is up to the government to direct t=
he BCUC to lift the rate freeze, and before it can do that, it has to sched=
ule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the BCUC's purv=
iew.  It has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing, and peo=
ple are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions ab=
out overall energy policy.  A rate hearing will be delayed until the new go=
vernment has completed its administrative "core review" and decided on a br=
oader energy policy, including its goals for BC Hydro.  Lifting the rate fr=
eeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the ra=
te stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over th=
e past few years, leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low-water =
conditions that have surfaced this year.  BC Hydro wants the freeze lifted,=
 and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing th=
e rate freeze given that it was put in place by the NDP and flouts free ent=
erprise principles.  This suggests the rate freeze is on the way out, but i=
t may persist beyond the original 30 September deadline for the reasons out=
lined above. How long it persists depends on how long it takes the new gove=
rnment to complete the core review.=20

FERC issued an order this morning staying indefinitely the California Refund proceeding.  In its order (attached), FERC notes that many requests for rehearing are pending and FERC intends to act on those requests soon.  FERC states that if it were to grant rehearing, it could affect the refund calculations being determined in the hearing proceeding, so FERC is staying the hearing proceeding until further order from the Commission.

While we don't know what FERC will say on hearing, it is very likely that the rehearing order will be a significant departure from the July 25 order.  We will let you know of any further developments.  If you have any questions, please let me know (202) 466-9160.

Bankruptcy
=09
Today, California Energy Operating Corporation sued Southern California Edi=
son seeking payment for November and December power sales, totalling $45M. =
This move is likely a sign of things to come.  It shows that generators do =
not believe that there will be a viable solution from the governor.   CalEn=
ergy is positioning themselves as a primary creditor.   Past experience dic=
tates that lawsuits are often used as a means of communication in bankruptc=
y situations.  In the case of a judgement in CalEnergy's favor, CalEnergy w=
ould be able to seize Edison's bank assets assuming there is no bankruptcy =
in the meantime.  It is another strategy for getting paid without actually =
filing an involuntary bankruptcy.  However, if there are enough of these su=
its or if Edison ignores a judgement in CalEnergy's favor, it will very lik=
ely be enough to trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, followed closely=
 by a voluntary filing.  The generators are stating that they will not subs=
cribe to any deal until their past bills are paid.  There currently is no a=
rrangement to pay the generators for power they are supplying to the ISO.  =
Thus, the generators are beginning to see the utilities and the state as on=
e and the same.

The governor is reportedly trying to come up with a plan that will result i=
n the lowest possible rate increase in order to minimize the public's react=
ion.  The governor has stated that he will put a plan in place in accordanc=
e with the "existing rate structure."  According to Rosenfield, he is consi=
dering a 19% rate increase.  This number was arrived at by combining the 9%=
 temporary, emergency increase passed by the PUC and a 10% rate reduction i=
mposed by the legislature under bill AB 1890 that is scheduled to expire ne=
xt month.  This increase would be put in place for as long as necessary to =
pay back the utilities' debt.  This plan contrasts enacting a 30% or 40% ra=
te increase over a period of a few years.  A lower increase over a longer p=
eriod of time, coupled with the financing charges over that same period, is=
 likely to have a detrimental effect on the California economy in compariso=
n to its neighbors.

Consumer Advocacy Group

The consumer groups continue to insist that the generators give something u=
p as part of any deal.  According to a source close to Harvey Rosenfield, h=
ead of a leading consumer advocacy group in California, Rosenfield feels th=
e longer it takes the governor to flesh out a deal with the utilities, the =
lower the price offered for the transmission assets will be.  This is due t=
o public pressure on elected officials not to enter into a bailout agreemen=
t; the pressure will only increase as time passes

DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

INTERESTING MEDIA ARTICLE (SEE BELOW) FROM DOW JONES ON PRICE CONTROLS
- Ray Niles (212-816-2807)

My comments:
This is a good article explaining the complex power market in California.
Basically, the problem in California is insufficient deregulation.  The
problems are worsened by the particular mixture of controls and market
forces which combine to create imbalances.  Specifically, while retail
prices are capped, wholesale prices are market-determined except that there
are restrictions against long-term hedging.  This is a recipe for high and
volatile short-term power prices, which we have seen.

Our view is unchanged that price controls set at a meaningfully low level
will cause blackouts by creating an imbalance between supply and demand.
This is elementary economics.  Price controls reduce supply (electrons flow
elsewhere seeking higher prices and power plants don't get built) while
demand remains artificially high (customers respond to the low, controlled
prices by maintaining consumption at high levels).

Price caps are THE issue now facing the industry.  We think meaningfully low
caps will not be instituted.  If they are, they contain a "self-repeal"
mechanism -- i.e., blackouts.  In our view, the only way to bring supply and
demand into equilibrium is through market-determined prices coupled with new
investment in power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines, etc.

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "as available" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "as available" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Bankruptcy
Early this week, there was a closed door meeting held by the Western Power Trading Forum in Arizona.  The meeting took place outside California to avoid press coverage and allow IPPs to maintain a low profile.  Association representatives believe that regardless of what happens with the PUC vs. Utilities ruling expected on Monday, some IPPs will take the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy.   Our source expects that absent a significant last minute breakthrough, the filing will happen within the next two weeks, and "probably" next week.  As stated in yesterdays report, the IPPs are very low on cash and are not able to cover the debts of the PG&E and Socal.  Only three creditors are needed with uncollected debts of more than $10,000 to file involuntary bankruptcy.

Bail Out
Davis has been meeting with the chief executives of both utilities in a last ditch effort to make a deal prior to Monday's court ruling.  The most likely scenario is for state ownership of the utilities transmissions assets.  However, coming to an agreed upon price will be very challenging.   In addition, PG&E and Edison appear to have competing agendas in pursuing a bail out plan.  Davis is expect to continue meetings through out the weekend in hopes of reaching an agreement before Monday.

The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please treat with discretion.

Executive Summary:
?	FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation
?	Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of out-of-state generators
?	June 1st "kill clause" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan
?	California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement
?	QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
?	New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
?	Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal

1.	FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 

2.	Something Less than Effective Price Caps
 From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
?	The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California.
?	As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling.
?	State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion.
?	Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3.	Proposal "Kill Clause" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a "kill clause" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines blaming him for letting the "Bush price caps plan" collapse.

4.	Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months.

5.	QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.
 
6	Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7.	Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a "non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.  

8.	Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged, creating an even further delay.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	State Budget Discussions Deteriorating -Bonds Issuance Jeopardized
?	PG&E Bankruptcy Advisor Comments on SoCal

Budget & Bond Concerns
Sources report that discussions within the state's budget conference committee have completely disintegrated.  Although last Tuesday's tentative $2.7B reserve agreement between the parties offered some hope to  the situation, Republicans have since completely broken with Democrats and are begging for a number nearly half of the previously agreed amount.  The legislative recess is scheduled to begin July 20th, and prior to the Davis administration, the legislature very rarely took month-long recesses due to the budget battle (there usually was a Democrat-controlled legislature and a Republican governor).  Sources report that if legislators take leave without a budget resolution, it would most likely compromise their ability to pass the budget and MOU, before the MOU's deadline of Aug. 15th.

Sources also indicate that delays in establishing the state's budget could prompt Wall Street investors to once again downgrade California credit rating.  A lowered rating could complicate the $12B bond issuance the state expects to offer in late September 2001 by forcing the state to offer a higher rate of return, which could mean fewer bonds.  Sources recently conducted a private interview with parties close to David Wiggs, head of the LA Department of Water & Power, (DWP is in constant contact with both SoCal and PG&E and is a creditor of both utilities and the DWR. -- Wiggs is close to and in constant contact with Governor Davis, Hertzberg and Burton, and he knows every other state official relevant to energy issues).  Wiggs' position on the bonds and SoCal follows:
?	The state is "really worried" about the bond issuance.  The state believes it can sell $3B in bonds now, but as for $11 - $12B, they are "not confident."  The state is currently trying to put its revenue streams in place, then it will have to prep Wall Street regarding the revenue streams. 
?	Wiggs saw Treasurer Angelides Wednesday (6/20) and told him that, "I wouldn't buy these bonds."  Wiggs stated that, "There is not a clear enough path for those rates."  
?	Wiggs was Hertzberg's advisor on energy.  He was also at El Paso (energy company, not gas company) during its bankruptcy.  Wiggs commented that he is worried because he lives in SoCal territory rather than DWR territory.
?	Both Wiggs and his DWR staff believe that an MOU/Plan B deal will not pass.  They are not thinking in terms of counting votes, but rather of the very large number of things that need to be done simultaneously in order to make a solution work.  

PGE Advisor on SoCal
Sources recently interview the attorney who is currently acting as bankruptcy advisor to PG&E, and may be the potential advisor to SoCal in bankruptcy proceedings.  Comment follow:
?	The attorney believes that the likelihood of a SoCal voluntary filing is 60 to 70%, but he does not know when it will happen.  The attorney would not speculate as to the likelihood of an involuntary filing, stating that he did not know. 
?	Concern was expressed that if a solution were passed to make SoCal liquid again, DWR (under instructions from the state) would then refuse to purchase the net short, leaving SoCal with a huge bill for power that it could not pay.  SoCal would then be faced with borrowing money to pay for the bill (an unlikely event, given their current status) or declaring bankruptcy.  The attorney commented that DWR had already tried to send power bills to PG&E in bankruptcy; Montali refused to force PG&E to pay them.  The attorney therefore believes that DWR is likely to force SoCal (and PG&E if it were made solvent) to resume paying for power as soon as possible.  The attorney believes that SoCal is aware of this problem and that it must be taken into account as part of a bailout solution.

?	Over the weekend, Gov. Davis and Senate Polance made an informal agreement whereby Senate Polance has agreed to sponsor the SoCal MOU bill.  Polanco is a Democrat and is  currently suffering through a personal scandal and as a result, it is  reported that his political career is essential dead.   Polance is planning to run for mayor of Los Angeles rather than run for another Senate term.  

?	The bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session, beginning today or tomorrow.  The bill would first go to the Senate Energy Committee.  Sen. Bowen, the chair of the committee, strongly opposes the MOU, so the bill is expected to remain in committee hearings for some time.  The longer the bill is involved in committee politics and changes are made, the likelihood of a SoCal bankruptcy increases.

FERC Price Cap Order Client Conference Call
Today, Thursday, April 26th at 11:30am EDT
Host: Ray Niles

Late last night the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") acted to
impose "temporary" wholesale power price caps in the western United States.
*	The cap affects the "real-time" market, which we estimate is only 5%
of the total wholesale market; it is set to           expire in one year
from May 1
*	This is a near-term negative for Power Producers and Energy
Merchants, a dramatic example of "headline risk". The political risk of
re-regulation has stepped up, in our view, reducing the multiple investors
will pay for earnings
*	In terms of earnings, ironically, the effect may be somewhat
positive, albeit small (only 5% of market is affected). Caps are likely to
increase volatility, benefitting Energy Merchants, and sustain high power
prices for a longer period of time, benefitting Power Producers, by reducing
the incentive to build new plants.

Louise --

LIsa Yoho suggested I forward the attached e-mail from yesterday on a conversation Linda Robertson and I had on the transparency issue.  My apologies for not including you on the original distribution list, as I should have done.  Your comments are most welcome.

Subject:	Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas


Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under "information required" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the "timely basis" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add "appropriate" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of "appropriate" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like "consistent with ..." or "promote competition" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =
the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=
ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=
 to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=
 changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=
he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=
y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=
his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =
that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=
sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=
 by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=
ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =
very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =
not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=
k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =
shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=
 have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=
 are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =
me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=
ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =
ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=
d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =
U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =
Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=
ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =
the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=
elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=
dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=
ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =
be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=
st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=
n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=
 of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =
development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=
 a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=
islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=
ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=
 will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=
elopment efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=
nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =
taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=
m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=
tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=
pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=
s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=
 to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=
 affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=
h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=
, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =
to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=
ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=
 Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=
, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=
tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=
erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=
ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =
Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=
.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=
ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=
pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=
e future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =
this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=
 the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=
oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=
r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=
or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=
nce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =
all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=
y best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =
appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

The CPUC still plans to vote on suspending DA on Thursday but a few new twists:

The State Treasurer announced last week that the State has no cash flow crisis and has adequate cash reserves and short-term borrowing capacity to last until the end of the fascal year in 2002 (we think July ends the fiscal year)
President of Senate says at press conference on Monday that he intends to ask CPUC to study how to provide DA while still protecting small customers (letter not yet written)
Enron's coalitions, AReM and WPTF, filed a motion at the CPUC today saying:

	-- do not suspend DA -- no longer an emergency
	-- begin immediate hearings to establish financial structure for continuing DA

Coalition of water agencies files independently today saying -- do not suspend, no longer an emergency


Stay tuned

The Commission discussed its market based rate policy at today's meeting.  They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:

For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the "Supply Margin Assessment" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  

Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  

Since the interim measure is only a "snapshot" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.

Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of "spot" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
?	House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass the bill would be longer than the California summer.

Executive Summary:

?	Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B
?	The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
?	Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature
?	The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
?	PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court.

1.	Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal

According to sources, the Assembly is "terrified"  of the current holes in the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward.
 
 Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  "not that far off"; it will likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is introduced.
 
2.	What Would the New Plan B Look Like?

- This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state is "fairly confident" that at least most generators  would not be successful in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from within his office.
 
3.	Transmission Lines

- It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the Assembly is "working on  this."

4.	Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate 

- According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet settled) "looks very good."  The vote in the Senate would  be "very close."  Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly "pessimistic" about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point.

5.	Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End
 
- As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents on the dollar.
 
- Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, since it would pay back most of what they are  owed.
 
6.	PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In
 
- If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can be offered at any time within  PG&E's "period of exclusivity."  This is a 90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition.
 
- However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high.
 
7.	Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure

- Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, this plan does not make the crisis go  away.

The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
The activity now moves to the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

Am I insane or am I just a highly paid preparer of FERC summaries for those who cannot read or comprehend FERC decisions?   AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!   P.S., I hope wee Scott is doing well.

Tom:

Linda has asked that we put together a paper, similar to the format you used for one of the California orders, for the FERC's recent RTO orders.  This is somewhat difficult because FERC issued 6 RTO orders plus two procedural orders establishing this new mediation procedure to produce one Northeast RTO and one Southeast RTO.  And, unfortunately, I'm going to be at FERC all day tomorrow.

Attached is a compilation of the summaries we prepared on the various RTO orders.  I worked a little on the opening paragraph, but after that it's just a cut and paste from the summaries prepared by several of us.

Do you have time to work on another great Tom Paper?  I tried to include all of the substance, but it really needs revisions and restructuring in order to be helpful to the uninformed reader.

I'll call you during a break to see if you're available.

Thanks Tom

Sarah

Executive Summary
Direct access could make a rescue of SoCal Edison more difficult
Bond issuances for California may be in jeopardy as direct access becomes more popular with municipalities

Municipal Power is Politically Attractive
There is growing pressure across California for cities to consider forming their own municipal power companies. Community leaders across the state are enviously eyeing the success of Sacramento's SMUD utility and the Los Angeles Municipal Power Utility, where rate hikes and service disruptions have been far less pronounced than the rest of the state. Several leaders in San Francisco are considering setting up their own power company, and another two dozen cities are also contemplating action. Municipal power companies are not subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, and could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes. 

Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best interest. Most older and larger cities are "charter cities" rather than "general law cities" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the California Constitution, charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army.  The League of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councilors and have some sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access. 

Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter, and this could affect campaign contributions. 

State Power Plans at Risk
If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power plans: 
First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. Others might cave into irate voters.
Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it.  It is possible that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open market.  It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss.
Third, revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled, if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments. 
The issue is at an early stage -- the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday.  State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult.

El Paso Line #1103

?	The El Paso restart approval has switched from the OPS to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  The NTSB is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast.

?	Once cause is established, the project will then shift back to the OPS, when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that El Paso is currently running.  At this point, OPS may request El Paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs.

?	The individual at OPS (in charge of El Paso's South Mainline) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested.  OPS will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time (ex.  line 1103 will be completely tested, analyzed, and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110).  The source indicated that as these lines are being tested/repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained.

?	We are currently developing sources at the NTSB for the following information:
-	Cause of action (#1103)
-	Timeframe to determine cause of action

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate
?	SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy


California Senate & SoCal's Fate 
With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:

?	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.
?	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.
?	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.  
?	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.
?	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.  
?	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)

It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov. Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are "optimistic" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.

Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Inside Edison 
There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.

SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.  

SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition.

According to a source who attended a private dinner last night with Gov. Davis in NYC:

1. Davis tried to express confidence on a positive outcome for the California situation, but when repeatedly pressed, continually failed to point to specific reasons for optimism.

-Most of the long-term contracts the state has signed are strictly "in principle" with no details.
-All of the long-term contracts the state has signed have an April 9th escape clause.
-A deal with PG&E on a transmission purchase is at least 30 days away, and thus far PG&E has not agreed to anything in the negotiations.
-Davis is "terrified" that a third party will bid on the transmission assets.

2. The state financial picture is worsening.  

-In Davis's "quixotic" quest to avoid rate hikes, the state is spending $40-$50 million per day to keep the lights on, buying power through the California Department of Water and Resources.
-If a deal is not reached by summer, these costs would rise to $75-80 million per day.
-The state has already used $3 billion of the $10 billion allocated for the power crisis and if this trend continues the state's surplus could be in jeopardy.  If the state switches to a deficit, its shaky credit rating could result in an expensive nightmare scenario for Davis, including state tax increases, cuts to core state services and electricity rate increases.

3. Davis Was Less Emphatic About Avoiding Bankruptcy

-Davis told our source that he "could understand" why PG&E would prefer bankruptcy to other options, such as the transmission sale.
-The source believed that Davis is hoping that bankruptcy court or the LA Federal Court hearing in front of Judge Lew on March 5th will again provide Davis with political cover for rate hikes.

Meanwhile, a Sacramento based source reports that:

1. FERC Chairman Curt Hebert is determined to "find" regulatory authority over the transmission line purchase proposal by Davis.

-FERC involvement could postpone resolution of the current Edison and prospective PG&E deals.
-Hebert would use FERC's reciprocal agreements with other publicly owned utilities as a basis for exerting jurisdiction over the proposed California Power Authority.

2. The legislature continues to lose faith in Davis.

-The Democrat caucus is concerned about state finances and the likelihood of rate increases.
-The Republican caucus sees a political opportunity in portraying Davis as wasting time on the transmission asset purchase proposal, rather than dealing with more direct solutions to the crisis.
-Both the Democrats and Republicans are concerned that Davis's plan will not work and all agree that there is no way around increased rates.  Even if a transmission asset deal goes through, the state will still be on the hook for $40 - $50 million per day for power purchases.
-AB IX requires that the money spent by DWR be repaid to the General Fund.  However, because it may be a while before the revenue bonds are issued, the Legislative Analyst Office (LAO) noted cash flow concerns.  The Department of Finance expects to have revenue bonds issued by mid to late May.

Executive Summary
?=09Edison's MOU Condemned at this Friday's CPUC Meeting
?=09The Idle Plan Z=20
?=09Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns=20
?=09House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief

Edison's MOU Doubtful
The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edi=
son's potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic=
 investment bank analysts and other company shareholders.  We have reported=
 that through all plans from B-Z, there is not a solid plan to save this co=
mpany and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may co=
me to fruition.

Over the last few days, Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the C=
PUC meeting this Friday as a make-or-break event for the company.  The is b=
ecause after the meeting, Davis's MOU plan to buy SoCal's grid will have no=
 chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy.  This plan is essentially dea=
d although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases.  The fin=
al nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voti=
ng on several necessary MOU provisions.  Unless the CPUC makes a last minut=
e, emergency - amendment to their agenda,  the deal will be dead (despite S=
oCal's support for letting the deal stand past its deadline).  Sources indi=
cate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and co=
ntinues to distance herself from Davis. =20

Attempting to influence policy making, Edison executives have spent the las=
t few investor phone conferences warning that June 8 would see substantiall=
y increased risks for a creditor-induced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies =
at CPUC.  This is interesting, since no one else seems to have been focused=
 on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week.  However, the=
re is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in =
two weeks.   As reported several times earlier, most everyone had given up =
on the MOU long before this Friday's CPUC meeting.

Plan Z Shows Little Progress
Meanwhile, the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday,=
 has gained little progress.  Legislators continue to pin-point a plan that=
 will secure re-election votes and at the same time, weigh the need for rat=
e hikes for California's corporate and home electricity users.  As they has=
h it out, the state is spending even more on electricity purchases.  In spi=
te of better than expected levels of conservation, the state's electricity =
expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $79M/day. The recent=
 rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into questio=
n the reassuring Angelides scenario for California's budget prospects later=
 this year.

The California Budget Crunch
Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last mon=
th's conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading=
. During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Conn=
ell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong.  Angelides a=
rgued that $7.2B already spent to buy power since January was really the to=
tal amount of authorized spending through late August.  In fact, he said on=
ly $4.3B of that had been "spent."  Sources now indicate that  Angelides wa=
s technically correct if you use "spent" to mean only the amount of money f=
or which checks had been written.  This is different than the amount of mon=
ey California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supp=
lied energy to the state.  In fact, when Angelides was speaking the state h=
ad in fact already promised to pay $7B for energy it had already consumed (=
the total committed has topped $8B.)  By the time the state gets its "power=
 bonds" auctioned in August, they will have already spent all $12B and be b=
ack to dipping into the General Fund.   The idea of RANs being auctioned be=
fore the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund does=
n't make it to August.=20

The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the =
painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of =
huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance.  Then the hope is =
that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wh=
olesale rates down and the debts can be repaid.   The only near term path t=
o bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3,500 MW from QF pl=
ants which are off line because of cash flow problems.  Settling their need=
s is wrapped up in settling the PG&E and Edison trade creditor issues, whic=
h makes the legislature's leisurely approach to the rate hike/haircut situa=
tion all the more troublesome.

Energy Relief
The House Energy & Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1647 (th=
e Emergency Electricity Relief Act) tomorrow at 10:00 am.  The bill which w=
as twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps, but d=
uring the course of the mark-up, sources indicate that it is possible, even=
 likely, that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment.  Rep. Waxman (D=
-CA) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark-up of the bill at the=
 subcommittee level.  The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines (=
all Republicans and 2 Democrats voted nay).  Sources inside Joe Barton's of=
fice report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromi=
se on the price cap issue, but nothing has been resolved. As of this aftern=
oon, those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse i=
n the Committee tomorrow.  Since an agreement was not reached, compromise l=
anguage is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow.  If it is, =
it would not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides=
 have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass.  Sources indica=
te that the committee does expect Waxman, and possibly others to offer pric=
e cap language, but it is not expected to pass.

Though announced yesterday that Davis and the Assembly Democratic leadership had cut a deal on an MOU for Edison, considerable uncertainty remains:

The legislative language describing "the deal" still has not been released. (We'll get the details out just as soon as they are available.)
Of the provisions rumored to be in the deal, Burton (Democratic leader in the Senate) has said publicly that spreading the utility undercollection over customers 20 KW and higher is a "nonstarter in the Senate".  (The Senate bill forces 500 KW-and-above customers to pay for Edison's undercollection (which amounts to about 3600 customers behind Edison.  Wall Street has said that 3600 customers is insufficient to securitize the undercollection.).
Unless the costs are spread across 20 KW-and-above customers, business is likely to oppose the bill strongly.
Business may also oppose the bill if it doesn't provide for "meaningful" Direct Access and self-gen, but at this point business seems to care more about spreading the undercollection than Direct Access.
There is no indication yet that Davis and the Democratic leadership in the Assembly have convinced a majority of Assembly Democracts to vote for the deal; but Davis is pushing very hard and the assumption is that he'll get the votes in the Assembly if he continues to push.
However, given Burton's comments, it's unclear whether the Senate goes along, even if Davis manages to push something through the Assembly.  But if Davis and the Assembly want it badly enough, the likelihood is that they will pass a bill that meets Burton's requirements and that Burton will move through the Senate.
Bryson, CEO of Edison, has said publicly that he doesn't know whether the deal will make Edison solvent.
Consumer groups are strongly opposed to any deal for Edison, saying 1) bankruptcy's the best answer and 2) they will run "the Mother of all ballot initiatives" to roll back any "bailout."
As of 1:06 PM CDT, PCG is trading at 16.47 (down 0.07); Edison's trading at 13.94 (down 0.07).

Best,
Jeff

Attached is FERC's press release on Southern RTO. 

The FERC did the right thing in not approving this RTO, but clearly they missed a golden opportunity to mandate GridSouth and Southern RTO joining together.  Another signal that more pressure is required to get FERC to open up these transmission markets.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of
Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO)
and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the
Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern.

Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only
new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives
going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy,
the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities
related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control.
As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's
tariff, operation or direction.

The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In
addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that
maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the
Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal.

As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that
Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The
Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a
Southeastern RTO.

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The "Edison MOU":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The "Dunn Investigation":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

Best,
Jeff

Transmission Deal and Democratic Support
As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed. transmi=
ssion proposal, one thing is evident; the longer the deal is exposed to pub=
lic debate, the less likely it is to pass.  In fact, politicians have been =
so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor =
to introduce the bill in the Senate.  In the eyes of many Democratic legisl=
ators (and all Republicans) forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking=
 like a better option than buying the transmission lines; that is why the G=
overnor's senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick "=
up or down" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week.  =
The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debat=
e, however, if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feel=
s he has enough support, it will be pushed through.  Because the SoCal deal=
 needs every piece in place as "negotiated" by Davis' team, the team wants =
no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote.  If this unli=
kely fast track strategy fails for Davis, the prospects for the transmissio=
n lines purchase will deteriorate steadily (keep in mind that that it canno=
t even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edi=
son attorneys).  According to sources, the legislature is going to try to m=
odify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov. Davis and SCE.  However,=
 the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to=
 pass even a modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes that at least 6 Democ=
rats will vote against it along with the Republicans.  The more that bill g=
ets picked apart in public, the uglier it looks and the more Democrats will=
 realize that they are all alone in supporting it.=20
=20
Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal =
and not the state.  Among other things, the state is overpaying by about $1=
.5 billion for the transmission lines.  Additionally, the MOU Davis has wit=
h SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point for point, the deal Davis condemned with =
PG&E.

Asset Seizures
Since before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset seiz=
ures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly f=
rustrated Democrats.  Davis' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law o=
n eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across=
 California to existing power contracts negotiated by, whom Davis's calls, =
"profiteering power brokers".  Of course, everyone in the Governor's office=
 understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal=
 courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitution=
al, legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the sei=
zing would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by =
press conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the righ=
t side of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one =
senior Democratic legislator, there is movement within Democratic members o=
f the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contract=
s in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase. Of =
course, taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking t=
he power plants.  The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would alle=
gedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold a=
nd reduce mark-ups substantially as they used the contract power authority =
to provide spot-market power purchases before peak emergency conditions dri=
ve the price through the roof.=20

Price Caps
One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur dep=
ends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Co=
lorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the Por=
tland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senior W=
hite House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of Pr=
esident Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous c=
all for price caps from the governors. "If they had signed that price cap a=
ppeal," the administration source said, "we would already have price caps. =
So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to li=
sten."  Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethink =
their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to r=
econsider price caps as a remedy for the West.=20

Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir=
st duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to=
 provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes=
 in a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at=
 something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the Au=
gust futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a long=
 way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above =
the cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh.=20

Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to hav=
e political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently =
,in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generatin=
g power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permi=
t grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into Ca=
lifornia in the existing "whatever price the market will bear".  In other w=
ords, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy =
at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market=
 share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC.=20

Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to establ=
ish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield "market pow=
er" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding pow=
er at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different ruli=
ngs in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of a=
bility over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the s=
ubsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wiel=
d effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no d=
esire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waivers=
 is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers=
 controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companie=
s come close.

In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administrat=
ion and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, that decision=
 may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere e=
lse in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few days Admini=
stration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabi=
lities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plant=
s.=20

Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush
Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could=
 come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a d=
ecade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear every=
day about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid $7 bi=
llion for electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay =
$70 billion this year -- ten times the rate two years ago. Then, of course,=
 they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredibl=
e numbers home in a very direct way, and, well, who can blame the Democrats=
 for saying there is a simple solution, but the White House won't allow it.

National level Democrats realize California's power crisis is a prime oppor=
tunity to chastise the Bush administration and its free-market advocate, FE=
RC Chairman Hebert, over their resistance to summer price caps.  As Califor=
nia's leaders calculate this year's taxpayer energy bill at potentially $60=
 billion, a rogue's gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are current=
ly meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across t=
he eight western states of the power grid with a singular message: "the sol=
ution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in Washington D=
C, at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees."  And=
 as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its=
 possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus, the=
 solutions articulated by California's Democrats who sense they have Republ=
icans on the run in the West become less and less "free market" focused.  T=
he two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable =
part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps. =20

At 1pm Houston time today, Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) will announce that he is switching from the Republican Party to become an Independent voting with the Democrats.  If this happens, control of the Senate will switch to the Democrats, which will give the Dems a majority and control of the Senate.   

?	All committee chairs would become Democratic and the Dems would control the legislative agenda
	( Energy bills, California bailout, possible investigation of who influenced the Cheney plan etc.).  In a profound 	ideological shift, Sen. Murkowski (R- AK) would be replaced by Sen. Bingaman (D-NM) as chair of the Senate 	Energy Committee.   When Bingaman takes over the Senate Energy Committee, expect pipeline safety issues to 	again come to the fore.  Bingaman is a strong proponent of tough pipeline safety regulation (particularly in the wake of 	the Carlsbad explosion last year) and will likely insist on strict safety requirements in the Cheney energy bill.

?	The recommendations for loosening regulations for oil/gas drilling, coal and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the Cheney bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation-oriented measures.

?	The tax bill will likely be downsized, particularly if Jeffords makes his switch immediately.  The timing is important because the Senate-House conference on the bill must be appointed immediately.

?	All presidential appointments would be controlled by the Dems.  This is significant because of the large number of sub-cabinet level appointments that need to be approved.

At the same time, Republicans are trying to convince Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA), who already votes Republican, to switch to the Republican party.  If this happens, it will cancel out the expected Jeffords move.  Initial reports are that Miller will not switch.

One other caveat -- Jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then flaked out.  But if Jeffords goes through with it and Miller stays put, the balance of power in Washington will be tipped in favor of the Democrats.

ubject: RE: Legislative Report (07/20/2001)=09



Dear all,

Attached is this week's legislative report.

This entire week has been focused on devising a "solution" for the energy
crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget. Although
the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully
lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the
budget on Monday, the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucia=
l
"trailer" bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill. There are
approximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budge=
t
bill, but 5 have raised concerns for the Republicans:  SB 767 Transportatio=
n
Funding Shift, SB 735 Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs,
SB 1041 Omnibus Health Trailer Bill,  AB 144 Public Social Services and SB
79 Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill.  Senate President pro Tempore John
Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate
until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly.  As of 7:00 p.m.
tonight, there is no budget deal.

Meanwhile, on the energy front, the four proposals we have been discussing
all week -- SB 18xx (Burton), SB 78xx (Polanco), AB 82xx (Keeley) and AB
83xx (Wright) -- are still "in play" legislatively this evening, even thoug=
h
the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals
are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly
and Senate to stay in session (despite the scheduled summer break) until a
bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to
him for signature:

*=09SB 78xx (Polanco) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001
passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 22 AYES and 17 NOES.  The
originally introduced version of SB 78xx reflected the terms of the origina=
l
Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") negotiated between Governor Davis and
Southern California Edison ("Edison").  It was recently amended to reflect
Senator Sher's proposed "Plan B" of the MOU -- a version of the MOU opposed
by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy.
It was heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee o=
n
Wednesday where it failed on a 4 AYES and 3 NOES vote.  Reconsideration was
granted, however, and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 AYES and =
2
NOES on Thursday morning. The authors took up amendments such as striking
the urgency clause, changing the rate component from 125 KWs to 500 KWs,
placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section 399.26
(which insulated Edison International from certain claims) during the
Thursday hearing.  SB 78xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Thursday with 7 AYES and 3 NOES.

*=09SB 18xx (Burton) Department of Water Resources: electricity: bond
financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 35 AYES and 2
NOES, making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower, cheaper rate
than allotted in AB 1x (Keeley) assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill
is signed by Governor Davis.  The bill also prohibits any additional charge=
s
such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and
requires certain "sunshine" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts
entered to by the DWR.  We understand that J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers
-- the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering --
have advised the governor's office that SB 18xx could delay the issuance of
the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons, so it is unclear whether
this bill will ever be signed.  The bill was heard by the Senate Energy,
Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a 1=
0
AYES and 0 NOES vote.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.

*=09AB 82xx (Keeley) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001
passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday
evening on a 11 AYES and 9 NOES vote.  It was then heard later the same
evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, where it was passed on a
11 AYES and 6 NOES vote.  This is the "compromise" bill we have been
discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred
Keeley.  The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this
report, with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by
the full Assembly, possibly later this evening.  The current version of the
bill provides for limited direct access, state purchase of Edison's
transmission lines for $2.4 billion, a minimum 30 percent "haircut" for the
major generators and a "trust" to cover all claims not dealt with by the
haircut option.

*=09AB 83xx (Wright) Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act
of 2001 was amended into AB 50xx (by Assembly Member Bill Campbell) in the
Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening, and the=
n
passed out of committee with 11 AYES and 9 NOES.  It next must be heard by
the Assembly Appropriations Committee, barring a rule waiver.  No such
committee hearing is scheduled at this time.  Co-authored by Assembly
Members Rod Wright, Keith Richman, Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell, the
bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address
the net undercollection, among other things.


Other energy-related developments this week include:

*=09SB 84xx (Burton) State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 30 AYES and 1 NO an=
d
sent to the Assembly. This bill provides $10 million from the state General
Fund to the California Energy Commission ("CEC") to fund a matching grant
program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals. The gran=
t
program will be administered by the CEC, in consultation with local
governments, and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup
system.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.

*=09The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board
for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday, the FERC announced on
Friday.   Despite a Dec 15, 2000, FERC order requiring the appointment of a=
n
independent governing board for the ISO, the state has refused to follow th=
e
order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of
the board. Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees
should not oversee power markets due to the state's domineering role in
purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities.

*=09SB 85xx (Burton) Electrical restructuring: rates passed out of the
full Senate on Thursday with 37 AYES and 0 NOES.  This bill bars the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from raising rates back to th=
e
pre-10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate
reduction period has expired on March 31, 2002.  It next must be heard in
the Assembly.

*=09The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to
Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company
executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies'
trading practices.  The resolution -- SR 14 -- passed out with 28 AYES and =
6
NOES.

*=09The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted
unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texas-based Reliant
Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents.
Despite Reliant's having handed over 10,000 documents, the committee
rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentialit=
y
of Reliant's documents. The committee stepped back from its contempt vote
last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to
agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas.
Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over
subpoenaed documents.  The contempt citation against Reliant will be
presented to the full Senate, and then immediately sent to the Rules
Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts, Dunn said.

*=09The state's estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped
from $8.9 billion to $6.1 billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment
in the state's figure on Wednesday.  Although the state continues to argue
that the $8.9 billion figure is correct, FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called th=
e
figure "baseless" and criticized the California delegation for "not
negotiating in good faith" during the recent settlement discussions.  The
new amount, $6.1 billion, does not include power sales to municipal
utilities and alternative energy suppliers -- two entities that do not fall
under the purview of the ISO, PX or the state DWR -- as well as applies FER=
C
price controls imposed June 19 and retroactively takes into account sales
from October 2 onward.

*=09AB 28xx (Migden) Electrical restructuring: Oversight Board: ISO
passed out of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on
Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with 7 AYES and 0 NOES.  It was amended by
the author in committee to "double-join" it to SB 39xx (see below).  This
amendment "ties" the ultimate fate of AB 28xx to the fate of AB 39xx, unles=
s
the double-joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the
governor for signature, assuming the bill gets to the governor.

*=09SB 39xx (Speier) Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly
Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with 7 AYES and 10 NOES.
Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to
the author.  Given the failure of SB 39xx in committee, AB 28xx is
effectively "dead" as well for the moment (see discussion of AB 28xx above.=
)



Best regards,
Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Angelides to Announce Bridge Loan Financing
?	US Senate Democrats Go Back & Forth With FERC
?	SDG&E Line Sale Overview
?	California DWR Contracts Add Tension
?	GE Accommodates Western Power Sellers 
?	PG&E Executives Profit Even in Bankruptcy

Angelides to Announce Bridge Loan Financing
As reported on the wires and confirmed by sources, State Treasurer, Angelides will announce a $4.3 B bridge loan today at 2pm PST.  The majority of the loan will be provided by J.P. Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers.

US Senates Withdraws Price Cap Legislation, Almost 
In response to yesterday's FERC order, the Senate Energy Committee Chairman Bingaman, and California US Senators Feinstein and Boxer have decided to temporarily withdraw legislation aimed at setting wholesale power price caps in western states.  The action displays an effort by lawmakers to acknowledge both Bush's and FERC's meek spirit of cooperativeness and allow some time to determine the Order's effectiveness.  At least one legislator remains unsatisfied as sources report that Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Oregon) plans to author a bill by July that would attempt to extend the one year term on yesterdays FERC order to cover the northwest's power shortages winter 2002.  Acknowledging the seasonal power swap between California and its northern neighbors, Smith views current mitigation plan covering two California summers, and only one northwest winter, as unfair.

SDG& E Line Sale
Through this deal, Sempra and the state assert that San Diego Gas & Electric's $750 M undercollect can be eliminated without a state purchase of SDG&E's transmission assets, which is the only element of the deal that would have to be approved by the legislature.  (This is a key difference between this agreement and the SoCal MOU.)  The other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the PUC.  In other words, Sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate SDG&E's undercollect just by dealing with the PUC rather than the legislature.  Sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the SoCal MOU to move in the legislature.  Sources also indicate that the earlier Trans-Elect offer to purchase SDG&E lines for ($1.8B) considerably less than the States bid only makes the California legislature more leery of approving the SoCal MOU.  MOU attached below.

Davis Kindles new Fire over DWR Contracts
Friday's release of the CADWR power contracts motioned Republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out.  Assembly Member Dave Cox (Minority Leader) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties, and instead these would be paid by taxpayers.  Backlash from the Republicans has been increasing as a new wave of California television commercials peg Davis as the root of  California's energy woes.  

GE Out West
Sources report that there are 3 or 4 GE generator sets (peaker plants) on the market now for $14 - $15 M.  This is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the California market because it is "too arbitrary."  Sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago. Additionally, Sources believe that GE may move to cost-plus-based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term, though this would mean less profits than in the past.

PG&E Executives Profit Even in Bankruptcy
As reported on 6-14, sources continue to believe that SoCal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the PG&E bankruptcy case, as mentioned in last Thursday's report "Judge Montali approved large bonuses for PG&E senior management after PG&E's filing made Bryson and other members of his team "reconsider" the merits of bankruptcy."   Today's news reports of Judge Montali's order providing PG&E executive with $17.5 M in bonuses just reiterates the point to Bryson that PG&E executives remain well-paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting SoCal could do equally well in the event of a filing.   Sources suggest that SoCal's current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures/liens (however, sources continue to make inquiries as to SoCal's cash flow situation.)

The Senate Energy Committee's meeting to consider and vote on Chairman Bingaman's electricity restructuring legislation and amendments to that proposal -- originally scheduled for tomorrow -- has been CANCELLED.  No new date has been announced.  Given the tragic events yesterday, at present we expect congressional activity to be suspended following today's sessions until into next week.  We will keep you posted on further details as they become available.

Subject:	California Update--Legislative Push Underway


 		


Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

Executive Summary
?	New Extraordinary session opened today
?	Forbearance period extended for SoCal
?	QFs placing liens on SoCal, moving them closer to bankruptcy
?	MOU is dead.  Nation's Plan B, an alternative to the MOU, will become a bill tomorrow and is gaining interest from both sides of the House.  SoCal and Davis has yet to give their support.

New Extraordinary Session
Yesterday, the Senate and Assembly passed resolutions to close the Extraordinary Session.  All bills from the 1st session be introduced into the 2nd session as they were last amended, with the same bill number.  

Forbearance Period Extended
Regarding the forbearance extended to SoCal by banker creditors, the parent company's credit has been extended until 30 June.  The utility's forbearance is until 15 September.

QFs Placing Liens on SoCal's Assets
The QFs are placing liens against SoCal's assets (property or freezing its bank assets).  As a result, SoCal is moving ever closer to bankruptcy, maybe as early as later next week.  These actions on behalf of the QFs are added incentives for the legislature to move quickly on an alternative to the MOU.

Alternative Plan to the MOU
The MOU for SoCal is essentially deal.  There are a number of alternative plans being proposed.  The legislature held meetings last night on Democratic Assemblyman Nation's Plan B alternative to the MOU.  This plan is gaining momentum.  According to sources, Republican Assembly leader Cox has signed off for people to work on the plan implying Republican interest.  Senator Burton's office also reported work on the same Plan B.  Governor Davis' office is aware of the plan but has yet to comment.  There is also no word at this time as to whether the Republican Senate leadership is in support of Nation's Plan B.

Key details of the Nation plan include a $1.2 billion option for the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets.  This money would be given to SoCal by the state regardless of whether the option was exercised, a detail likely to be unpopular with voters.  The remainder of the undercollect, stated as $3.5 billion or an amount determined by PUC review, would be paid through securitization of the undercollect by SoCal.  Moreover, the utility would sell the state additional power at a cost beyond the 10 years already agreed upon in the memorandum-of-understanding and additional power from other company sources.   Sources report that the Nation plan also currently calls for generators to take a 30% haircut. 

The Nation Plan B will likely be introduced as a bill tomorrow and will likely go through start the legislative process by early next week.  The next scheduled floor session is Thursday; we should be able to tell how fast the legislature intends to move the bill.  There is no indication whether SoCal Edison would agree to the Nation plan.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal would object to at least some of the plan's provisions (for example, a PUC audit of SoCal's debt amount to determine the direct rate component to pay for the undercollect).  SoCal is very much at odds with the PUC and wishes them to play as little role as possible.  If SoCal does ultimately agree to the plan, the state reportedly may offer a similar deal to PG&E.

Below is a brief summary of the BC election results and some analysis into the new political party's' implication.  As the new BC energy strategy further develops, we will provide a more detailed follow-up reports.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	New Democratic Party sweeps election
?	Opposition within newly elected party possible
?	Campbell to consider dividing BC Energy and Mines portfolio

NDP Election
As expected, the NDP was "wiped out" by the Liberal Party.  At this point, the Liberals have secured 74 of 79 "ridings" (a "riding" is the BC terminology for an open seat), while the NDP has won only three.  Counting has not yet been completed in another riding, though it is expected to go to the Liberals, as well.  The final riding, in Victoria, is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots.  The NDP is currently trailing the Liberals by 50 votes.  This dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 May, when all absentee ballots will be counted.  No other parties secured seats, though sources report that the Greens acted as a "spoiler" for the NDP in several cases.

Opposition Party
Sources speculate that it is possible that, due to the poor showing by the NDP, a new Opposition might form within the ranks of the Liberals.  Approximately five former members of the Social Credit Party (which was disbanded in the early 1990s) were elected to Liberal seats.  Sources state that it is possible that these members could re-form the Social Credit Party within the legislature to act as an Opposition to the Liberal government.  Sources also state that Richard Neufeld, as a former Reform Party member, might choose to join this Opposition if it forms, though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur.  Otherwise, due to the landslide, Campbell's Liberal government is expected to have a "carte blanche" to do whatever it wants.

Minister of Energy & Mines
Campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first.  There reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the "backbenchers" (MLAs), meaning that there is likely to be "considerable jockeying" for positions.  However, there are 6-10 obvious contenders, including Richard Neufeld, who is likely to be named energy minister.  Sources report that Campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat, though the size of the reduction is not known at this time.  However, he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development, forming two separate positions.  It is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio.

Market Update

A pair of new Pacific Northwest power plants is coming online this month.  The Klamath Cogeneration Project in Klamath Falls, Oregon, will start feeding 486 MW of electricity to the region's power grid. An additional 270 MW are expected to come online this month from Rathdrum Power, a natural gas-fired plant near Rathdrum, Idaho.  All told, nearly 1,240 new MW of power are expected to be buzzing through the region's grid by the end of the year, marking the first major steps toward erasing the Northwest's estimated 3,000 MW power deficit.  

Aluminum Smelters (DSI's)

Alcoa Aluminum
Alcoa's Intalco smelter are negotiating with individuals within BC Hydro to serve as an alternate electricity seller.  BC Hydro individuals are Kelly Lail, Manager of Resourcement Management, Ray Olegaard (title unknown at this time); and Mike Costello, President and Chief Operating Officer of BC Hydro.

There is considerable interest by Wall Street analysts regarding this deal, which has implications on both the aluminum and electricity industries.  This interest is making it more difficult than it ordinarily would be to get information on this target, but we will continue to research this.

Kaiser Aluminum
Kaiser Aluminum is still on the 'outs' with BPA after having been the worst bidder in the load reduction agreement sweepstakes a few weeks ago.  Power prices will have to continue sliding into the low-to-mid $30's before Kaiser will be able to resume smelting operations.  We are still under the belief that Kaiser is bringing back employees to its smelters in an effort to realize 'shareholder value' to affect potential M&A activities.  Although the company has denied that its Trentwood facility is up for sale, we would not be surprised if a competitor steps in and makes an offer.

British Columbia

BC Government
It appears that BC is going to offer an olive branch to California to see whether or not they maintain good relations with the state.  BC officials claim that California utilities still owe them $290 million for electricity sales into the state last year; on the other hand, California claims that BC Hydro was part of the scheme of market manipulation and $8.9 billion in overcharges by energy suppliers.  It looks like the Minister of Energy, Richard Neufeld, and others are favoring a plan to work out a financing plan or a way to forgive California of the $290 million debt.

Recent estimates indicate that at current power generation levels, British Columbia will be a net importer of electricity in 2007.  Officials are looking to put together an extensive plan that will combine off-shore drilling, a streamlined BC Hydro, and improved US-Canadian natural gas and oil transmission pipelines with a look toward alleviating this growing need.  Under the BC Liberal administration, alternative power sources such as wind power are unlikely to receive much attention - indeed, Neufeld has already moved to downplay the cost-effectiveness of wind and solar power, a clear indication that fossil fuels will play a considerable role in the future of BC energy activities.

BC Hydro
BC Hydro has selected a new chairman and CEO, Larry Bell.   Upon taking the position, Bell was immediately hit with a blizzard of criticism from the remnants of the NDP on the left.  Mr. Bell is currently sweeping BC Hydro with a mandate to deregulate segments of the business - at least two major areas of Hydro operations are now looking like they will be farmed out to the private sector:  information technology and transmission lines.  Our contacts have suggested that potential bidders for Hydro's transmission system are beginning to put their bids together due to the rapidity with which Bell is expected to move.  It is likely that Bell will look to maintain Hydro's core business of power generation and keep PowerEx, the trading arm, of the organization.

BPA


Spill-Related Issues
BPA reservoirs are currently at 58.2 MAF, far below the 100 MAF that is typical for this time of year, but enough to meet current BPA load requirements.  Bonneville has not been aggressively spilling water for salmon this summer; they anticipate their decision not to spill, coupled with load reduction agreements with DSI's, have put them on solid footing for this winter.  However, we should not expect BPA to be moving to secure any new contractual agreements soon (it is more likely that they want to get out of existing contracts).

Ed Mosey, spokesman for BPA has said, "We are in pretty good shape.  We'll have enough water to meet our firm load requirements, but there won't be any surplus to sell."

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	  British Columbian Government Exploring Energy Issues
?	BC Hydro Readies Itself for Transmission Line Sale
?	BPA Aborts Additional Rate Increase, Refutes California's Overcharge Claims



BC Government
The BC Liberals have announced that they are putting together a new Policy Task Force on Energy to deal with energy issues going forward.  They will be looking at the province's energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward.  The Task Force includes:

Jack Ebbels, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, Chair
Peter Meekison, energy policy consultant
John Bechtold, oil and gas expert
Erik Westergaard, hydroelectricity expert
Brenda Eaton, Deputy Minister to the Premier

Our information is that the Policy Task Force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process.

Additionally, the Canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19.4% US tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the States.  A BC Cabinet Minister has made veiled threats to tie Canadian energy exports to the United States to eliminating the softwood timber tariff.  Jean Chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks, but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in Northern BC along.  

BC Hydro
BC Hydro Chair Larry Bell is soft-peddling the BC Liberals' message of deregulation.  Coming under intense scrutiny, Bell has already gone public to defend BC Hydro's rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and PowerEx operations will not be deregulated.  We noticed, however, that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth.  We believe that BC Hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short-to-medium term.

Two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are:  Trans-Elect Corporation, which has indicated it is watching the British Columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in Calgary; and TransConnect, which has been working with the RTO-West group, which could eventually plug BC Hydro's transmission systems into the RTO West grid.  

Bell has been talking about instituting a tiered-rate plan for BC's own energy-intensive industries, allowing energy-efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate, increasing rates for others.  He is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in BC.  However, Bell has not been as hot on "clean coal" generation as Neufeld, having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology, which has been economically and environmentally sound.

Strategically, Hydro's export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border.  From what we are seeing of the new Chairman's position, it appears that BC Hydro will attempt to sever the "feeling of entitlement" that BC's own energy-intensive industries have relied on.  That is, Hydro is snooping around the States for greener pastures after having had a taste of the California windfall last year.  Why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere?

BPA

Financial Conditions
To everyone's relief, BPA last week announced there would be no additional rate increase. In early August the agency had warned that its pre-third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial-based cost recovery adjustment clause (FB CRAC), one of three CRACs BPA and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices. The load-based (LB) CRAC has already driven a 46 percent rate increase, and the FB CRAC could have added another 4.5 mills. But the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger, so there will be no additional rate hike.

Additionally, we have also heard that BPA is still committed to spending roughly $186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues.


FERC Refunds
Although BPA has not issued an official statement, as a net supplier to California it is likely that BPA would be opposed to California's attempt to recoup over $1.5 billion in perceived overcharges from the Pacific Northwest.  Earlier this year, BPA responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled "BPA response to California ISO study" on 13 April 2001which maintained that its operations were above reproach.  BPA will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from Cal-ISO's allegations.

Pacific Northwest utilities and other energy-using entities, such as the City of Tacoma and the Port of Seattle, also have joined in the fray to pursue $2 billion in perceived overcharges.  The name of the game on the West Coast is to say that you were a net importer, not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by FERC and the federal judge.  Everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers, not sellers.

Spill Issues
The Power Planning Council has recommended spending more than $7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year. Most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the John Day River in Oregon, with $1.6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the Yakima River.  The $7 million is in addition to $24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main-stem dams. BPA had agreed to fund $9.3 million worth of the Council's list. 

Other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the South Fork of Idaho's Clearwater River, spending $300,000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of Oregon's Umatilla River, and installing stream flow gauges in the Entiat, Okanogan and Wenatchee rivers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CPUC Terminates Direct Access
PG&E/SoCal Bankruptcy Developments


Direct Access
Despite the information that a CPUC representative responded favorably to a vote-delay request sent by the state's major business interests, and pressure to delay the vote from Governor Davis, the CPUC effectively terminated direct access in a 3-2 vote.  Our estimates regarding the votes of commissioners Brown, Wood, and Lynch did play out, as well as the CPUC's failure to pursue retroactivity for DA agreements.  The CPUC's move to carry forward the DA vote is not a complete surprise, as President Lynch has historically presided independently from pressure by Governor Davis.  Dismayed that the California Legislature was unable to offer resolution, Lynch and other commissioners felt obligated to provide direction and move the state forward in securing the State's economic base.  Note that DA agreements signed within the last three months may still be held under review by the CPUC, though no official word has yet been issued.

The CPUC also passed two measures that were preventing the progress of California's $12.5B bond sale.  There is still no clear date as to when these bonds will be issued.

SoCal/PG&E Bankruptcies 
Mirant and Reliant (with Mirant leading the push) are reported have approached several entities as potential third parties for a creditors committee to take SCE into involuntary bankruptcy. 

The City of Long Beach has been approached, but we believe Long Beach will use its leverage as a potential third party creditor to negotiate an independent deal with SoCal for payment of debt.  Orange County, Coram, and San Gorgonio Farms are also suspected to have been asked to sign the petition. 

Contrary to rumor, it is not confirmed that Dynegy is considering joining Mirant and Reliant.  However, such a move by Dynegy "would be logical" and note that Dynegy funded, with Mirant and Reliant, recent polling research examining the public opinion effects of such a move. Dynegy is reportedly discussing the possibility. 

We are attempting to determine SoCal's response to the PG&E filing, the Mirant-Reliant effort, and to try to pulse the likelihood and timing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition.

Per earlier media reports, PG&E just announced it is filing three months early of a reorganization plan with the court. We believe that the utility was motivated, in part, by its desire to scuttle any chance of a state MOU with SoCal in the third special session of the Legislature. The reactions of key lawmakers (Burton, Bowen, Hertzberg, Keeley), and of course the Governor, will be important to watch.
The key elements of PG&E's plan include: 

Assumes all responsibility for debt. No state aid requested. 

The utility will be split into two, with a distribution company remaining under CPUC regulatory authority and the native generation spun off into a new company free of CPUC oversight but regulated by FERC. 

PG&E commits to provide 100% of its native generation to the State of California for 10 years at cost. 

Cost of power includes both cost of generation (currently about 3.5 cents per kw/h) and cost of financing (estimated by our sources at 1.5 cents per kw/h).

All debt will be paid, with 90% of QF debt paid immediately and the remainder over a longer term. Large generators will be "substantially" paid immediately and be asked to carry remaining debt over a longer term.

Beyond California: The Power & Merchant Energy Outlook for 2001

Recent Publication: The Power Curve and Merchant Energy Monthly

We see continued strong fundamentals in the wholesale power markets as
we move into 2001.

Forward markets show average U.S. power prices 92% higher in 2001 than in
2000.

The western hubs have seen the most staggering increases; however, the
markets foretell stronger prices across the country in 2001.

We continue to recommend the Power Producers, based on both our power price
and spark spread analyses, which show strengthening spark spreads in the
United States, despite the record highs recently seen in the natural gas
markets.  We highlight Calpine, NRG Energy, and Mirant.

Our volatility indices demonstrate a dramatic shift in historical volatility
to the western hubs and away from the Midwestern markets of 1998-99.  We
expect volatility to persist in the West, likely accompanied by higher
volatility in the remainder of the country in 2001.  This benefits Energy
Merchants, and we highlight Enron, Dynegy, Duke, and El Paso.

Subject: Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary


The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P=
ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20
=20
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo=
del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin=
g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  Ho=
wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=
termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =
platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =
There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=
ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=
he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=
C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=
).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=
odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =
a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=
rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=
mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=
tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=
 will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=
r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=
 would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=
ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=
ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=
 the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=
r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=
ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=
opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =
2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).

The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=
rid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with=
out any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed cha=

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=

Her opinion is that the "Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=
ponsored) Model" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=
t) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=
 of Order No. 2000 based on a "best practices" analysis of other RTOs and C=
ommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =
model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=
al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =
in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=
s not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=
sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=
nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=
ilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =
an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=
dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=

solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=
dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=
 system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=

Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=
re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an=
d had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=
 the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s=
cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =
 In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=
 that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=
g:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=
wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=
ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=
ssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=
tail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to u=
tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners=
.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =
extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta=
rt" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud=
ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the in=
itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "b=
est practices" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L=
MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b=
oard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant=
 stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the =
fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a mini=
mum, consider similar mediated "jump starts."=20

Attached is a list of parties the Cal ISO has identified in an earlier report that had "overcharged" the market from May - Nov 2000 (the filing was mistakenly put into the FERC docket room).

EES is listed as party B8 with $27.9 MM as Excessive Rents.

The biggest overcharger was BC Powerex with $176.2 MM.

We are still analyzing the implications of this list and will get out any other information.

Attached is a fax I received of a filing the ISO made yesterday afternoon to supplement its comments in Docket No. EL00-95-012 regarding market monitoring and mitigation.  The filing links the names of the suppliers and importers discussed in Dr. Sheffrin's analysis to the code numbers used in yesterday's filing.  The ISO had requested confidential treatment.  The fax is in TIFF format and you can disregard the first page as it is a cover sheet to me.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

The CPUC postponed its vote to suspend DA until a meeting on Sept 13 at 2 pm.

The CPUC issued a new draft of its proposed decision that makes the suspension effective on the day of the vote.

A direct access bill may move out of the Senate to the House today or tomorrow -- SBXX 27.  This bill would have no suspension of direct access.

The "Edison Bailout" bill (SBXX 78) is scheduled to be voted on today -- if the Speaker in the Assembly can garner enough votes. That bill would suspend direct access as of August 25.

As always, everything is fluid and changing.  

The Legislature is scheduled to end its Session on September 14.

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they hadn't already."  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that "they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are "speculative" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the market could handle."  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer."

Details are still rough and the situation is very fluid, but here is what is currently going on:

Senators Hertzberg and Keeley are amending both SB 78XX and AB 82XX.  Upon an initial read, it appears that they are doing the following:
AB 82XX has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio.  (The core/non-core business provisions, the transmission asset purchase, etc. all appear to have been deleted.)  Both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated. 
It appears amendments have been made to SB 78XX but the extent of these changes are not yet known.  
At the beginning of both amended bills, it states, "As proposed to be amended into SB_XX."   This means that amendments to SB 78 could be incorporated into AB 82, and vice versa.  Another possibility is an entirely new bill.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

RE: California Order Proxy Price Calculation

We have had an initial opportunity to review FERC's Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation of Public Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy Markets, and will provide a more detailed summary early next week.

However, questions have arisen as to the calculation of the proxy price when a stage 1, 2 or 3 emergency is called.  In initial discussions with FERC staff, we have determined that the price mitigation will work as follows:

For the following day, the ISO will publish at 8 a.m. an average of the daily prices published in Gas Daily for all California delivery points, as well as emissions costs.  The emissions costs will be calculated by the ISO using the Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Service.  The marginal unit will then be determined via the single price auction in the hour, and the ISO will then take the previously submitted and confidential heat rate data and multiply it by the posted average gas price and emissions costs for that hour to determine the market clearing price.  The ISO will not be calculating an estimated market-clearing price in advance.

A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be "equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	California's Bond Inevitability
?	Davis Faces Even Greater Financial Woes
?	California's Creditor Status Debated by Court
?	Windfall Profits Tax Bill (SB 1X/AB 128X) Passes Senate Vote, Davis expected to Sign Off

California Bond Battle
SB 31X passed the Senate today by a simple majority vote, initiating the 90 day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance.  Sources indicate that contrary to media reports, a possible referendum on the SB 31X would be unlikely for Harvey Rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient funding.  He reportedly would need to raise $250,000 - $500,000 very quickly.  Sources believe that it is more likely that Harvey will attempt to set up an initiative later this year or in 2002.

Davis Financial Woes Just Beginning
It is unclear whether Governor Davis truly will be able to move money around within the state budget to cover power purchases until August.  Of the $13.4 billion bond amount authorized, approximately $6.7 billion has already been spent on power.  It is likely that the state will spend more than the remaining $6.7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued.  Sources indicate that most of the long-term contracts Davis talks about are unsigned and not really in place.  This means that the state may still have to purchase the majority of power on the spot market, which further complicates the situation.  As reported earlier, this explains why the Republicans wanted to wait for Davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing the bond issuance.  Given the lack of contracts in place, it appears that the bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state's power purchases.

"To Be or Not to Be," Is California a Creditor? 
Sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community reviewing California's revenue bond bill SB 31X, are unclear as to whether the state of California has claims as a creditor.  It appears at this time, that the Assembly re-wrote Senator Bowen's language so that the bill relies on the existing interpretation of AB 1X as to when the state gets paid by the utilities.  This exact issue is currently being reviewed in the PG&E bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between legislatures and utilities.

Windfall Profits Tax
According to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in committee in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other's version of the bill.  Sources further indicate that the Senate version SB 1X, has not yet been referred to an Assembly policy committee and that a "significant reconciliation process" between the two bills must occur.  For example, unlike the Senate version, the Assembly version reportedly does not set a price cap based on a firm dollar amount, but instead leaves the decision up to a regulatory committee such as the PUC.  Once the bond issuance passes the Senate and is officially authorized, the state will likely be able to get its bridge loan from the lenders.  However, sources indicate that the bridge loan is "dead" unless the Senate moves before Thursday.

Note highlighted sentence....perhaps DeFazio is right( for the wrong reasons granted).....I know the RTO efforts can't be "marked" today, but you might want to hug ( but not, of course,  in a budgetary sense) your favorite regulatory person today.



Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that "a bunch of bureaucrats" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of "what it does for local reliability." 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.

Executive Summary
?	If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day "opt-out" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
?	PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
	PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies
	Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
?	PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing utility.
?	Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some details:
	Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this summer 
	Some of the "long term contracts" are really only for three months
	None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market
?	One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly announce a 10% rate hike.
?	FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
	
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power contracts being negotiated have a one-day "opt-out" clause they can exercise unilaterally if a "comprehensive solution" has not been reached by the state and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the "electricity buyer of last resort."  Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is demanding a "comprehensive solution" that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "get out of jail free" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must "positively approve" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit.  "We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they think," according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  "We are going to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case." Negotiators for Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads. 
?	Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
?	Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
?	Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will "make them whole" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior political official told our source "just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they come up with something even more outrageous." 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed "long-term" power deals for 8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now, but these contracts "guaranteed" that consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 megawatts); and some of these "long-term contracts" are actually only good for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But they may be wrong. "The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what anyone says," according to source close to the President. There are three possibilities: 1) FERC could "pocket veto" it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not be around long enough to have his say. "Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position," says one Washington official. Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and one of them "could easily become chairman."

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will keep you updated.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

?	A source within the generator community confirms press reporting that Coram Energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week.  Through an intermediary, we were able to corroborate this information with a senior member of the CA ISO board.  Coram  Energy is a relatively small wind generator QF based in West Vancouver, British  Columbia, though it also owns wind stations in California.  Coram has 238  40 kw units.  
?	The source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the  fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for Governor Davis  to be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature.  It is  unlikely that blackouts would happen in April or May, meaning a  long wait for the cash strapped QFs to wait to get paid.
?	The filing will be against Socal.
?	In order to file an involuntary bankruptcy, Coram  would have to file along with at least two other creditors owed $10,000 or more.  Sources report Coram has two other creditors who will file with them (working on finding out who they are).
?	Sources also report that other QFs are "taking  legal advice" on how to proceed in light of these developments.

Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year. 
"I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it "neither needs nor deserves. 
"I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation." 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to "iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
"I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FERC Settlement Developments
SoCal Ed. MOU/Plan B
The CPUC's New Rate Proposal

FERC Developments
FERC's publicly recognized autonomy regarding California power talks likely has a less public, less autonomous, role in determining the outcome of debated refunds.  The following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the California settlement negotiations:

The Bush Administration does have influence over what FERC decides -- especially now that Pat Wood and other Republicans are there. The influence is certainly not formal (as FERC is supposed to be an independent agency), but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the "political lay of the land" -- particularly regarding the positions of the White House.
Bush and Davis do not like each other (no surprise there). Communication between the Davis Administration, the White House and FERC is not free flowing. Interaction between FERC and White House is frequent -- but with Davis only on an as-needed basis. (Staff level contacts are more regular -- especially staff of the Democrat commissioners).
Administrative Law Judge C. Wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $1 B -- and the Commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends. This would be for October forward. Wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later.  
Wagner has also strongly advised FERC and Bush (as well as his top advisors) that they will have to put price caps on, stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue (even though those steps run afoul of the "free market" position of the Admin -- and his own members). He has a great deal of influence with Bush.  

MOU & Pan B
Late Thursday (7/12) Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the Edison MOU.  The new proposal (now ABXX 82) reduces the value of SoCal's transmission system to 2 times book value (the state had previously agreed to pay 2.3 times the book value, or $2.76B).  Given the dire financial condition of the Socal Edison's parent company (EIX), the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $420M already promised by EIX.  Assembly moderate Democrats led by Keeley and Hertzberg feel that a $4.5B generator refund, a profit from the State's sale of the SoCal transmission lines, and an additional $1B from a dedicated rate component are all distant, but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a SoCal bail-out.  Of course, two thirds of these suggestions require FERC approval.


PG&E predictably views the new proposal "DOA" because it is a less attractive model to be applied in their bankruptcy proceedings than the initial SoCal MOU.  Alternately, at least one of Edison's executives indicated that SCE was confident that there would be a legislative proposal flowing from the MOU that the utility would ultimately be able to accept. He went on to describe the contours of such a proposal: It has to "make it look like Edison is getting hurt" to counter consumer group criticism that it is a bailout. This would be accomplished by providing something less than the $3.8 billion in under-collections. He also noted that the tricky part would be picking the right percentage below 100% -- go too low, and the generators drag SCE into bankruptcy.

CPUC Rates
The PUC will likely publish shortly (in a matter of days) a new rate agreement giving the DWR first call over the utilities on any money available for purchasing power.  If this rate agreement leaves SoCal with too little cash to operate going forward, the likelihood will increase that SoCal will file for bankruptcy protection.  It does not appear that there is enough cash for purchasing power under the current structure for both DWR and SoCal to remain solvent; therefore, in order to save SoCal from bankruptcy, the legislation governing DWR's power purchases will likely have to be revised.

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

Executive Summary:

Bottom line- QFs better off today, utilities in worse shape
After passing Senate, the QF Bill fails on technical grounds in Assembly
Cal Energy ruling provides possible escape for QFs from utility commitments
California net short gas supply for the summer worsens if QFs break contracts
Hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper, further litigation expected

1.	QF Bill Fails In Surprise Twist

AB 8X (the QF  bill) failed in the Assembly (48-24). The Republicans were opposed because three  measures, the SDG&E fix, the AB 1X fix, and the QF fix were all rolled  into one bill by the Senate. They want the three measures split up. Concern  was raised by San Diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to  see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in SB 43X.   As noted yesterday, the QFs will now await a CPUC ruling on Tuesday.

2.	Cal Energy Ruling Sets Stage for "Dozens" of Similar Q.F. Suits
 
The CPUC ruling is now less important because of the Cal Energy ruling yesterday, which gave the QFs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities. Cal Energy reportedly would have filed an  involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow (Friday) had they not won their law  suit.  Dozens, if not hundreds of suits identical to  that filed by CalEnergy can now be expected from the other QFs.  The QFs  reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct  into the merchant market, possibly out-of-state.  They also want to avoid  any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a Stage 2 or  Stage 3 alert, and will contest any such measure with the FERC.
 
3.	Summer Outlook Worsens

 The outlook for the summer now appears much  grimmer for the state.  If the gas-fired QFs alone manage to extricate  themselves from their contracts with the utilities, the state will be a net  10,000 MW short for the summer rather than 5,000 MW.  This is a much larger  net short position to fill, and will be much harder for State Treasurer Angelides to sell to  Wall Street.  If all of the QFs break their contracts, the state will be  14,000 to 15,000 MW short.  Essentially, if the QFs are successful in court  (as it appears they would be), they are no longer part of the pool of low,  fixed-rate power that the state can count on.  The onus now appears to be on Treasurer Angelides  to come up with a rate schedule.  The QFs may go to him and ask for the  state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts (the state would, of  course, charge for this privilege) and negotiate a more flexible rate  structure.  

4	Pressure Mounts on Utilities

None of this helps the utilities'  situation.  In fact, now that the QFs have a way out of their contracts  through the courts, it appears that the business base of the utilities is  reduced, so they are actually in a worse situation.  Reportedly some of the utilities' commercial  paper now has been sold to hedge funds.  As one source put it, "the vultures  have moved in."  These are "the types of people who litigate."

Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.
A story related to the deal is attached.
If you have any questions, just let me know.

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

In a nutshell:

The governor and assembly leadership (without Rod Wright) have reached
agreement and believe they have the 41 votes to support the below:
o There will be a $2.9 Billion bailout that can be used to pay the QF's and
the banks, but not the generators-either directly or indirectly-and will be
recovered through a Dedicated Rate Component charged to consumers 20 kwh and
above.

o Business and consumer interests are being briefed at the moment by the
staff of Davis and Angelides on the proposal.

o The easement language is consistent with the language proposed in 78xx

o The renewable portfolio standard language is primarily consistent with
82xx however discussions on final language are continuing now.

o Regarding the transmission lines and direct access, language has not been
written and discussions are also continuing.  In fact much of the bill is
being drafted now and is said to circulate tomorrow among members.  Davis
has indicated that he wants a vote as soon as Thursday

o The Senate has not agreed, but there are staff meetings going on now.

o The CPUC has not involved in the discussions, but the administration
continues to assure that no CPUC action will be taken in contrary to the
language of the bill.

Please feel free to call with questions and as always we will keep you
posted.

Sources have conducted the following "off-the-record" interview with a BC Hydro executive.  

Executive Summary
?	BC Hydro projected capacity 
?	BC Hydro/Liberal Government's export policy
?	BC Hydro expanded capacity projects

BC Hydro Capacity
The individual stated that BC Hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply British Colombia through 2005, even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion.  He stated that BC Hydro's long-term contracts to supply power to the grid in the Western US amounted to only 1% of BC Hydro's capacity.  Therefore, the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through Powerex, the company's "main revenue generator."  For example, according to a company report, BC Hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $2.876 billion Canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001, largely due to spot market trading.

BC Hydro Exports
BC Hydro feels the new Liberal government likely will "make a concerted effort to expand capacity" in British Colombia. Likewise, since the Liberal government will be "business-oriented," the BC Hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the US.  However, the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point, as "people don't necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export."  This is due to broad-based environmental opposition to building more plants.  Therefore, in the long-term BC Hydro's new projects will favor "green alternatives" such as dam expansion and biomass, thermal and solar plants over gas-fired plants.

The spokesman stated that the Liberal Party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove BC Hydro's monopoly on power.  If and when this happens, relations between the company and the government are expected to "quickly sour."

BC Hydro Capacity Projects
BC Hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand/improve generation capacity, including:
?	Seven-Mile Dam -- BC Hydro will likely add a 213 MW turbine to the 3 units already in place
?	Revelstoke Dam -- BC Hydro is "looking very seriously" at adding a 500 MW unit to the 4 units already in place.  There is also the potential to add a 5th 500 MW unit, though this is not being considered at this time.
?	Site C Dam -- A plan for a 960 MW dam was shelved in the 1980s due to environmental concerns, but now appears to once again be a "viable option." Though BC Hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time, the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980s, and that resurrecting the plan would be a BC Hydro decision.
?	Burrard Thermal Plant - BC Hydro has invested $250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions.

Calpine has bought a 240 MW gas-fired co-generation plant called Campbell River on Vancouver Island.  This plant is "in the final stages of testing and is already generating."  Calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "in the next few weeks."  BC Hydro will buy power from the plant for use on Vancouver Island. This is part of a plan to make Vancouver Island self-sufficient in electricity.  Another "key plank" in this plan is the Port Alberni plant, a 250 MW, independently-owned plant that is being sold to BC Hydro.  The plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply Vancouver Island.

Based on meetings in Washington and New York through yesterday and updates early this morning, here is what we know on the stimulus bill debate.  The prominence of the is debate will increase and intensify throughout the month and is quickly shaping up to be a critical measure of post-9/11 bipartisanship and a prelude to the 2002 mid-term elections.  Contact Brendan Fitzsimmons at x5-4763 for follow-up.

Competitive Analysis

HILL STIMULUS BILL UPDATE: 11/02/01

SUMMARY
Timing: Bush wants a stimulus bill by Thanksgiving, but that is looking highly unlikely without a major (and unlikely) capitulation on the Hill; even a bill by Christmas is less likely than it was just a few days ago, meaning any rebate checks wouldn't come until well into '02; and there remains a risk that nothing is done this year
Next Week - Fed and Senate: Sources report that pessimism concerning passage of fiscal stimulus increases the likelihood that Greenspan pushes for a 50bp cut on Tuesday.  Expect a partisan mark-up from Baucus' Senate Fin. Committee next Tuesday or Wednesday, setting the stage for stalemate and very public political recriminations.  
Data Pressure: It is too early to tell whether the massive jump in unemployment rate to 5.4% will change the atmospherics surrounding this week's talks, but before the number it was clear that the extreme partisanship will delay passage and make the final cost of the package more expensive as all sides try to "buy-in" votes during final Conference Committee negotiations
Conference Outlook: If a compromise bill is reached, expect final numbers to run higher than $100B as more of each bill gets into the final conference bill

REPORT
Hill and White House
Bush's speech on Wednesday was the opening move in the White House's plan to pressure for a compromise stimulus bill; but WH message and the Republican chorus that followed have only provoked stronger resistance from Daschle and the Dems on core healthcare, unemployment provisions
Yesterday's White House discussions with Senators Baucus and Grassley went nowhere. The White House is now refusing to meet with them prior to Senate action. Senate Finance Committee leadership is planning for a "highly partisan" session on Tuesday or Wednesday next week in attempt to pass the bill that Senator Baucus drafted and released last week.
Bush must spend more political capital and give stimulus greater visibility, priority in order to get House and Senate compromise; expect Treasury to join the fray against Daschle warning of minimal stimulus and maximum danger for future budgets well into the future
Daschle is digging-in (and with Senate Finance chair Baucus still standing loyal), buoyed by focus groups and polling showing that standing up to the House Republicans' tax-cut weighted bill is a winning message
The Senate bill has several elements that are strongly rejected by the White House and the House Republicans including the extended health care facilities under COBRA. This was the key to administration attempts to find a compromise and that has now failed. 
Although there may be legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee during next week's mark-up, it will be passed on an exceptionally rigid party line vote and the entrenched positions on all sides will be further reinforced. 

Macroeconomy  
Fed Tuesday: Treasury's announced plans to end 30yr bonds and today's employment report will strengthen pricing of 50bp on Tuesday and a further 25bp December 11 and will continue to direct attention back to the back and forth between the Hill and WH.  After Fed meeting focus will be on O'Neill and Lindsey within the Administration
Waiting on Washington: Heightened sense of immediacy as US macro data continues to confirm recession: with a $100B stimulus bill already priced in to the market, delay or failure in passing a bill could have strong negative effects.  This week's raft of weak data, particularly today's confirmed weak employment report, will increase the pressure for movement on a stimulus bill

Executive Summary
?	FERC Considers Price Caps in the West
?	Davis/SoCal Ed MOU subject to legislative revisions (we still stand by our early reports that the SoCal/Davis transmission deal will most likely fail and that SoCal will follow PG&E into bankruptcy court)

FERC mitigates price spikes in the West
FERC Chairman Hebert has placed a RTO West proposal onto the agenda for this week's meeting. The proposal would "mitigate" price surges by requiring generating companies to sell power into California and other western states during Stage 3 emergencies (when there is less than 1% surplus electricity in the grid) and cap the price generators could charge during these highest states of emergency. 
1)  The FERC proposal would not set price caps for any other time than Stage 3 emergencies
2)  It would expire after a year
3)  It would set the top reference rate at "cost plus" based on the cost to produce electricity by the most inefficient producer 
FERC is also looking at initiatives that would encourage the agriculture industry to possibly sell their power and natural gas contracts instead of using them to produce their products. Although this proposal has not been formally approved or voted on at this time, the Chairman's control over FERC's agenda is absolute and nothing gets on the agenda he does not want to consider. Thus, if it stays on the agenda through meeting time, the odds of it passing are quite high if the meeting avoids total breakdown into hard-headed chaos. The key has been Commissioner Breathitt.  The two recently nominated Commissioners have not yet been approved by the Senate and so cannot vote this week. Thus any change in Breathitt's position definitively tips the balance of power in FERC.
Davis & SoCal. MOU not a Done Deal 
According to sources, the first legislative alteration to the Davis/SoCal MOU will involve removing the dedicated rate component necessary to repay SoCal's creditors.  This point only highlights the Senates' indecision on how to deal with paying off generators.  Solutions currently range from seizing assets to seeking legal relief for corporate price gouging and sources indicate that the QFs are still likely to file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal upon the Senate's first official sign of unwillingness to work with creditors.

he few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended SB 78XX were in place =
due to lobbying efforts by Gov. Davis.  No doubt the count will be close, b=
ut Hertzberg will only take the bill up in the Assembly for a vote today or=
 tomorrow if he knows Democrats can muster enough support.   =20

The key issues related to getting the 41 votes to pass SB 78XX are the foll=
owing:=20
Including the option to buy the transmission lines.  For some this is a phi=
losophical issue; these members are quite adamant that the option to buy th=
e lines needs to be removed from SB 78XX.
Excess profits and creditworthiness - In particular how Edison can use any =
profits.=20
The philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necess=
ary given the experience with PG&E.  And members are skittish about voting =
for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway.

According to Assembly leadership sources, no Senator has asked the Speaker'=
s Office for anything to be put in the bill (except for a Central Valley se=
nator, Jim Costa, who played a party in brokering the deal on Shaver Lake).=
  Leadership sources were surprised by that, and believe that many senators=
 will not hold to the Burton line of "don't even change a period in the bil=
l."  Several senators including Polanco and Costa are vested in the bill's =
passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant o=
pposition. =20

Many people, including Polanco, believe that Burton may require his worker'=
s compensation reform plan to be double-joined to the Edison MOU in order t=
o take it up for a vote.  Double joining is a legislative maneuver that tie=
s the fate of both bills together.  It creates a situation where both must =
be passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in order to go into=
 effect.  If the Governor only signs one, neither becomes law.  But the Gov=
ernor's office has told us that Burton made a direct statement to them last=
 week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to SB 78x=
x. =20

Some suggest that Senate opposition lead by Burton (which remains considera=
ble) may introduce a new bailout bill if SB 78XX passes the Assembly.  This=
 new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the Assembly.  The Senate=
 then would pass this bill on the last day of the session, and then adjourn=
 without a conference committee.  The Assembly would then be left to accept=
 or reject the Senate's bill without the possibility of amendments.  (This =
is somewhat similar to what the Senate did in July, only now the recess wil=
l be until next year.)

SoCal Bailout Barriers
Regarding media reports referencing Assemblyman Keely's deal with Davis to =
exempt 5,000-acres of the Shaver Lake area from the bill's conservation eas=
ements, the protesters representing Fresno feel that this is not good enoug=
h and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the e=
asements.  These protestors (and the Republicans who represent them) felt t=
hat they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week, but thi=
s language is now gone.  While the Shaver Lake amendments (and all conserva=
tion easement language) are again in the bill, we do not believe this will =
significantly interfere with the bill's passage.  Some Central Valley membe=
rs voted in support of the bill despite the amendments, and there is only o=
ne Democrat, Dean Florez, who may vote against it because of them.

Some Senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond p=
ortion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds "Harvey-proof" - that is, i=
mmune from a referendum by consumer advocates.  This language, which was pr=
eviously used in the California rate reduction bonds, is structured such th=
at California's credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid (th=
is is done by involving the California Infrastructure Bank as a party to th=
e bonds).  Some members of the Senate who are in close contact with Harvey =
Rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remo=
ve this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout.  If the langua=
ge is removed, there is no way that the state's credit is tied to the bonds=
.  This means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum withou=
t endangering the state.  Current polls show that such a referendum, which =
would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bai=
l out SoCal, would very likely succeed.  This would mean that the bonds cou=
ld not be repaid.
=20
Wall Street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bon=
ds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum, meaning that removing the=
 "Harvey-proofing" language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will no=
t be able to be sold.  SoCal is also aware of this possibility; if the lang=
uage comes out of the bill, the plan will no longer be acceptable to SoCal.

SoCal: Selling Out or Going Under
There is word in Sacramento of companies "sniffing around" for a pre-packag=
ed purchase of Edison after the bankruptcy occurs.  We will continue to inv=
estigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available.
=20
It is also rumored that if an "inadequate" bill passes - i.e., one that wil=
l not return SoCal to creditworthiness - SoCal may declare voluntary bankru=
ptcy, then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy=
.  The only requirement laid upon SoCal is to attempt to go back into the m=
arket by January 2003, and there is no penalty for them failing to do so.  =
There appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them fr=
om using money from the bailout in bankruptcy.

?	Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a solution with SoCal.

?	Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is "not an option" for SoCal.  However, the possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

?	However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was rushed for "political purposes," but the details still remain to be decided.  It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be extended.

?	PG&E reportedly refused to part with its transmission assets in its negotiations with the governor.  PG&E makes more money on transmission than distribution of power, the opposite is true for SoCal.

Executive Summary
?=09Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not =
for past utility debt
?=09Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net shor=
t for PG&E this summer=20
?=09As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptc=
y chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs
?=09FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditio=
ns for California

California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases=20
Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the Depart=
ment of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to consumer=
s on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate hikes t=
o be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from consumer =
groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer advocate =
leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption, but remai=
ns adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR, which =
is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to secu=
ritize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to sign =
long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every da=
y on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is essential=
ly bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such as order=
ing supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of Finance is =
forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other programs) to purc=
hase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued.  The C=
alifornia State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a recommendatio=
n on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10 billion worth =
of state bonds.=20

Davis & PG&E at Odds=20
Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult ch=
allenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer gro=
ups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3), an=
d 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the =
ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to li=
mit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The util=
ities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars furth=
er in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their utilit=
y subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is bei=
ng hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the sta=
tes' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would pro=
vide Davis with even less negotiating power.

With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state legi=
slature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and State =
Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a special =
Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price mani=
pulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.  Davis i=
ncreasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being pick=
ed apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.

QF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy
Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patienc=
e and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's=
 Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filin=
g against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's cos=
ts and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the St=
ate's senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and fur=
ther investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.

Out with Hebert, In with Wood
The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pa=
t Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republ=
ican Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants W=
ood.  The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to=
 pick a fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some wester=
n states in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert =
has made several token concessions to California, including $69 million wor=
th of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pip=
eline and power plant installation. =20

It's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal =
that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions m=
ight include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well=
 as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions=
 in the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps a=
nd believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also consideri=
ng whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such=
 as BPA.

FERC to Examine More Price Mitigation
It is reported that FERC will be looking at HR 1974 by Rep Doug Ose (R-CA) as the basis for expanding their mitigation efforts.  Basically it expands mitigation efforts to apply around the clock rather than in emergency instances.  The letter from Rep. Tauzin to Ferc Chairman Hebert which prompted Hebert to call the meeting on Monday is supported by 14 House Republicans.  At this time, it appears FERC is seriously considering expanding price mitigation to the WSCC states.  However, the administration still opposes price controls, and in case price controls are applied, Secretary Abraham yesterday inoculated against taking responsibility by saying "FERC is an independent agency.."  The FERC agenda will apparently examine at least four price mitigation cases California filed with FERC:

?	Extending FERC's current price mitigation efforts to all WSCC states and amending the current price limits applicability --now in effect only during stage three power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
?	Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.
?	Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity.
?	Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies. 

Attached below is Rep. Tauzin's letter to Commissioner Hebert and likewise HR1974.

If you read Ray Alvarez's summary from yesterday evening, open the attached=
 Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since =
receiving the final order, which was issued this afternoon.  Alan Comnes

The full order is available at: http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.h=

SUMMARY OF FERC'S
ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIF=
ORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLI=
C UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS
(Issued April 26, 2001)

Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs t=
o have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ=
ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time to t=
he extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, eve=
n those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into=
 the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's inters=
tate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This r=
equirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price a=
uction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in th=
e ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a particip=
ating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid =
its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas =
costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost will be the av=
erage daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions ar=
e to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services.  The I=
SO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to be used for the=
 next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These figures (for th=
e next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgeral=
d data. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all g=
enerators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas-fired generator =
must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a confidential basis, hea=
t and emission rates for each generating unit.  The ISO will use these rate=
s to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance an=
d operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at or below the market clea=
ring price will not be subject to refund liability.  (Although the followin=
g qualification is made: "However, all public utility rates will be subject=
 to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on market-based rates, =
discussed infra."  Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavio=
r.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, th=
e generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report wit=
h FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC explicitly acknowledges that=
 some units may have gas costs that exceed the "all delivery point" index i=
t has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in rea=
l time.  Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be =
prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or po=
rtfolio with no opportunity cost. =20

Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending =
request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it=
 is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy p=
ower in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator =
subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC=
 order.

New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission's pri=
ce mitigation measures.


Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entit=
ies must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to b=
e curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand curve =
more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours (24/7)=
) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
 outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the =
order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages, includ=
ing periodic reports to the Commission.

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1 or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consiste=
nt with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
 things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d=
ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical with=
hold of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate=
 bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of th=
e generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on un=
it behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently b=
e inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited=
 (i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other=
 prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit muc=
h higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due t=
o increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.

West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  - Opens a section 206 investigation co=
ncerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAI=
SO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitig=
ation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real t=
ime (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot markets w=
hen contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a control area.=
    FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comments=
 are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Although it is still formul=
ating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PNW, the FERC sets t=
he refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine=
s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa=
rt of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generat=
ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr=
ice. =20

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on (1) whet=
her FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an es=
crow account to pay past costs and (2) the effect this surcharge would have=
 on the PG&E bankruptcy filing. =20

Treatment of the CAISO's Market Stabilization Plan (MSP). The FERC rejects =
the CAISO's MSP saying that FERC's plan for market mitigation is sufficient=
.  It expressly rejects CAISO's plan to create a day-ahead and hour-ahead e=
nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to imple=
ment software changes to effectuate such markets.  Unfortunately, it does n=
ot expressly reject CAISO's plan to cut exports.  In general, no mention wa=
s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the stateme=
nt that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO mu=
st honor firm schedules on its system..=20

The following update has already been forwarded to Tim Belden.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Aluminum Smelters (DSI's)

Kaiser Aluminum
Kaiser Aluminum has begun the recall of 40 to 50 workers to its Mead smelter in Washington.  They are beginning the process of getting their operations back into productive capacity as they await load reduction negotiations with BPA - perhaps using the recall as a posturing tactic to threaten restart.  Kaiser wants BPA to give them $17 per megawatt hour to shut down operations for two years beginning October (competitors are being paid $18-$20), but it seems unlikely that BPA will budge now that spot electricity prices have reached reasonable levels in the 50MWh range.  To make a long story short - Kaiser botched their chance at a great deal and is now lining up the troops to threaten BPA into signing.

Alcoa Aluminum
Alcoa is still in talks with BC Hydro in regards to restarting its Intalco smelter operations.  Consequently, the bottom line with the BPA load reduction agreement priced in at $18-$20 per MWh and a rough estimate of $30 per MWh break-even point on electricity prices - Alcoa could go to BC Hydro with a much more aggressive bid on electricity.   With current market prices floating near $50 per MWh and a $20 MWh load reduction payment from BPA for the next two years, there is a very real possibility Alcoa could profitably restart operations if prices break lower and find a stable price there.

Contacts close to BC Hydro are aggressively pursuing the inside track on these negotiations, particularly on the Hydro's side of things.  We are aiming to find out a potential restart date and will report when available.

BC Hydro

BC Government
BC Government has been allowed to gain intervener status in discussions regarding the Sumas-2 power plant sitting in Northern Washington State near the Canadian border.  This border dispute has been going on for the last 18 months, the Canucks citing air pollution as a major public health hazard coming from a site so close to Canadian cities.  Now the BC government has been allowed to sit in on sitting negotiations and provide its input - a large step forward for BC now that the NDP has been stripped of power.

On the offshore drilling front, there has been no direct legislation this week, although it is believed that the Greens and the remnants of the NDP environmentalists are on the ropes on this issue.  Sources indicate that the labor-environmentalist split that took the House Democrats on the ANWR vote in Washington last week will likely mirror itself in the offshore drilling and forestry debates in British Columbia.  Many labor groups have allied themselves with corporate interests in the past and are likely to do so again if the issue of oil royalties and jobs are at stake in Northern British Columbia.

BC Hydro
There has been no real movement this week on the BC Hydro front.  They are awaiting the selection of their new Chair and Board upcoming by mid-September.
Bonneville Power Authority

Financial Solvency
Senator Patty Murray has stated she will go to the mat on the ANWR debate and that there will be no room for equivocation on this front.  Whether or not this opening salvo is meant as deterrence or smokescreen remains to be seen, although a reliable source suggests she is not willing to change her position in exchange for increased BPA funding.  Sources indicate that the bill before the Senate to increase BPA's funding by $2 billion to a total $5.75 billion with the provision of annual reports to the Senate was opposed by GOP leadership in the Senate and by the White House.  It is likely that Murray would scrap the bill altogether unless a viable alternative emerges.

FERC Oversight
There remains a question as to whether or not Chairman Hebert's resignation at FERC will play a role in Murray's decision-making.  It is our understanding that upon Hebert's resignation, a vacancy will open in FERC, and there are no restrictions to its partisanship since the Commission will have two Democrats and two Republicans in it.  That opening creates an opportunity for some individuals who were initially passed over the by White House to have another shot at becoming a FERC Commissioner.

We are entertaining two scenarios:

?	The White House looks to use the FERC vacancy to gain influence in the ANWR vote, should labor's influence not be strong enough to swing a victory.
?	The White House is confident of the ANWR victory and will appoint a Republican to the position - most likely a contender on the short list being someone who was passed over recently in favor of Woods.

Spill Issues
There are no additional spill issues that have been brought up this week.  We are not expecting anything substantive until the end of August to come from this area.

Other Dam Issues
PacifiCorp and the Yakama Indian Nation have signed a preliminary agreement to file a joint competing license application with FERC for the Priest Rapids hydro project, now operated by Grant County PUD. Representatives of the utility and the tribe indicate their goal is to more broadly share the benefits of the two-dam, 1900-MW project with the region. Grant County PUD, which holds the existing license, now uses about 37 percent of the output; the rest is under contract to 12 public and private utilities, with the region's four IOUs receiving the most. 

This is an example of the growing influence of tribal nations on water issues in the Pacific Northwest.  While it is unlikely (to say the least) that tribal nations will take control of BPA-operated dams, they will increasingly become energy players in this region.

Forest Fires

The Chelan blaze has been controlled and there are no major forest fires, which warrant disruption of electrical transmissions.

As an FYI, our DC office heard today that FERC may issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) potentially strengthening affiliate codes of conduct in the natural gas industry on June 25.  The range of outcomes could go from anywhere from simply rationalizing 497 (natural gas code of conduct) and 889 (electric code of conduct) through full divestiture (although this is highly unlikely).

If this happens, it is most directly the result of the on-going litigation at FERC surrounding El Paso Merchant's use of capacity into California.

As soon as we hear anything additional, we'll let you know.

Jim

Louise --

We had decided that not having Mark in the room gave us the ability to wiggle if questions on CFTC vs. FERC regulation arose.  As you can imagine, FERC is starting to grapple with the issue that financial trades in energy commodities is regulated under the CEA, not the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act.  

Thanks,

Jim

Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.  Some key considerations:

The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something done.
The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having "done nothing."
Becauase the Assembly has thus far "done nothing," the only thing it has in front of it is 78.
The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out.
Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where the Senate would have to approve it.
Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that Burton's inclined to come back.
In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes to 78, that "it's 78 or nothing."  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues.
All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could move. 
Will report back as information becomes available.
Best,
Jeff

The Assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up SBX2 78 in committee on
Friday.  If the bill passes, it may go straight to the Assembly floor that
night.  The Senate may go in either late Friday or early Monday to take up
the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed.

Amendments to SBX 78 may be available tomorrow.

About 1 AM this morning, the Legislature adjourned -- the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU (which included DA provisions) and the Assembly without passing out Bowen's green DA bill. 
On the SCE MOU, Governor Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU. The special session would begin in about 2 weeks. 
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.
The CPUC is scheduled to take up its vote to suspend DA on Thursday, Sept 20.
A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 
As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 
But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 
"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 
The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 
Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 
The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 
"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 
The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 
The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 
It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 
While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 
Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 
The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 
The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 
"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

Dear all,

As referenced in the IEP legislative report sent out by us last evening,
Senator Joe Dunn took up the report by his Senate Select Committee to
Investigate Market Manipulation on the Senate Floor moments ago today
(07/21/2001). His procedural purpose was to have the report referred to the
Senate Rules Committee. His statement was that, "Enron continues to remain
out of compliance with the committee" and that this report details the

Attached is the EWS Tax Group's analysis of the California Assembly's current version of the proposed excise tax on "excess gross receipts" payable to electricity marketers selling power into California.  Suffice it to say that it is a poorly thought out proposal.  I am working with the EWS Legal Department and Legislative Affairs Group to provide them the Tax Group's assessment of matters and will keep you apprised as things progress (or, hopefully, not).  As of today, Assembly Bill No. 128 is in committee and has not yet been passed by the Assembly (the Bill that has been discussed as having been passed is Senate Bill No. 1, which Bill is inconsistent with Assembly Bill No. 128 and, therefore, will have to be reconciled with it at some later point).  I will forward under cover of separate E-mail our analysis of Senate Bill No. 1.   Best regards.  SHD.

Executive Summary
?=09California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
?=09California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to "Plan B"

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will se=
t up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September o=
r October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or Augus=
t.  However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October a=
nd November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from t=
he DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for pow=
er.  He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge "Plan B"
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge "Plan B" b=
efore the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a retroa=
ctive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review power=
 purchases.  This is because "Plan B" enables SoCal to collect a dedicated =
rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going forward.=
  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate componen=
t to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This takes=
 the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off the =
state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same time,=
 it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power purchase=
s.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of a ded=
icated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the PU=
C.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to th=
e responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the PUC.=
  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for p=
ower that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as "=
arguable"; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, re=
gardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to c=
loud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of t=
he Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe=
 it might "go a long way toward avoiding these problems."  Were this to hap=
pen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates "just and reasonable," which would =
likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such meas=
ures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that "the state =
needs to tease the feds into doing this."  This can be done by conducting s=
tudies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would use for d=
etermining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of "teasing=
" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California politicians=
 are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to impose.  It=
 appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is delaying=
 the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these constitutional iss=
ues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as municipal entities=
 would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there remains very signi=
ficant opposition to this idea, especially on the Republican side.  A state=
 purchase of the utilities would likely only gain momentum once Plan B bega=
n to fail for the reasons cited above.  Additionally, a state purchase of t=
he utilities would be less expensive were both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.=
  (His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica=
, overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years=
.  His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities R=
ate Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding =
to support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he w=
ill likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

FYI

Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided bel  o   w 


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

FERC Meeting Highlights
Responding largely to the recommendation of AL Jude Curtis Wagner, FERC ordered the following regarding the California refund matter.  The order is not expected to be issued in draft form but will be published in final form within the next couple of days.
Refunds
When: Additional evidentiary hearings in 45 days to determine refunds: 15 days for parties to submit data, followed by 30 days of hearings.
Pricing :Refunds ordered for "spot market" transactions in California from October 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. The reference price for refunds will be determined by the methodology FERC set out in its 6/19 order, with one change -- the cost of generation will be based in part on the daily spot price for natural gas, not the monthly spot price as called for in the 6/19 order.  
Additionally, FERC is ordering both jurisdictional utilities and non-jurisdictional entities (i.e. public power groups such as the Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power) to make refunds.
Parallel hearing ordered to determine whether refunds are due for power sales in the Pacific Northwest.  Commission members said they would be flexible in defining spot power sales in the Pacific Northwest.

The Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that:
the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).
the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.
If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.
Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.
Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding Direct Access.  We wi=
ll continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated.=20

Summary:
Direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key compon=
ent of California's 1996 deregulation law.  Under this concept, all custome=
rs could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated util=
ity.  The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attemp=
t to solve California's costly power crisis.  It will determine whether bus=
inesses, with residential customers, pay for the bulk of the state's future=
 energy purchases. It also could determine whether Southern California Edis=
on, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will avoid bankruptcy, and whe=
ther deregulation will survive in any form.

Big businesses, free-market advocates and alternative energy providers have=
 lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so-called "direct access".=
  Now, as the state prepares to sell $13.4 billion in bonds to begin paying=
 off its debt, legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big b=
usinesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct-=
access escape route.  Regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the =
system, the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long-term e=
lectricity contracts through 2021.  That would mean residential ratepayers =
would be stuck paying the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs, a =
point that has enraged consumer groups.  Currently, only about 88,000 custo=
mers buy their energy through direct access (per CEC statistics), including=
 about 10,000 large commercial/industrial customers, and about 78,000 resid=
ences.  Alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back =
to California's primary utility suppliers (SoCal Ed., PG&E, SDG&E) earlier =
this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with uti=
lity rates capped by the Legislature. =20

California legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the late=
st Edison bailout plan, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley. =
Under the plan, the 3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billio=
n of Edison's debts over 15 years.  In exchange, businesses would be allowe=
d to secure their own power contracts by 2003, but not without first paying=
 an "exit fee."  The fees and which parties would be exempt remain undeterm=
ined, however, they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation =
in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases.  It =
is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding =
direct access, California's business community will have extreme difficulty=
 accepting the terms.

To ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fe=
ars of a collapsing state budget, lawmakers have gone so far as to introduc=
e two bills, (one sponsored by Sen. Bowen and defeated in July, and a secon=
d by Assemblyman Dave Kelley,) that would rescind language in previous legi=
slation that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to block direct acc=
ess.  The California PUC has thus far stayed a decision on the matter, but =
is expected to rule by August 23rd.

Complicating the issue is Wall Street.  The state's bankers, led by J.P Mor=
gan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state bo=
nds if businesses (currently the largest ratepayers in the state, after gov=
ernments) find a way out of the system.  The bonds are meant to repay the s=
tate for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover s=
ome future costs.  Business and residential electricity customers would rep=
ay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills.  If businesses wer=
e allowed to sign on with outside energy providers, that revenue stream wou=
ld be in jeopardy.

Subject:	Northeast RTO Mediation Report

Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is "subject to extension" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a "business plan" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years ("Option 1-M"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years ("Option 2-M" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 ("Option 3-M" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining "Best Practices."  Although PJM also conducted a "best practices" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are "best practices."  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) "far outstrips" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that "impatience, haste and greed" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process "at the expense of sound policy" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint." See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the Edison MOU. 
?      A snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome. 

Procedural Scenarios 

Assembly 
The Assembly Appropriations Committee's plan to take up SB 78XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote.  While the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Friday's draft bill, it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend.  If the problematic "Shaver Lake" provisions are removed from the bill, Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill (although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition).  If the Shaver Lake amendments remain, several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee.  

Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal, and the business community supports some recent amendments. This likely mitigates concerns from other pro-business Democrats.  With or without the Shaver Lake provisions, Hertzberg should get at least 41 Democratic members (and probably a few more), but no more than 2 Republicans (if any) to vote Aye on the bill.  Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass, and there are 50 Democrats in his caucus.  If the vote is close, a personal plea from him and/or the Governor should enable him to get to 41.

Senate 
The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assembly's amendments. This is where the prognosticating gets difficult.  Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB 78xx.  Gov. Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal, but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed (due to a variety of factors), and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position. 
This would lead to one of four scenarios: 
?	Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate, and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept. 15th, 
?	Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition (this option is unlikely), 
?	Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill (as it is passed by the Assembly) for a         vote in the full Senate with his support,
?	Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg, but as part of the deal, he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments, and another vote in the Assembly - before a vote in the Senate.

John Burton is considered one of the smartest, and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today, so it is problematic to guess his next move.  Additionally, external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result.  For instance, the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way (e.g. workers compensation benefits, drug courts, reapportionment).  Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult.  But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him, and given Burton's past actions, he may string them along, holding out for several days (maybe even until Sept. 14th) before he agrees to anything.

Governor 
Assuming the bill escapes the Senate (and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes) the Governor will almost certainly sign it, regardless of Edison's public position.  The bill will go into effect 90 days after the Governor signs it.
Consumer groups have vowed to undo any "Edison bailout" enacted into law by way of the ballot box.  That could be either (1) an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB 78xx and replacing it with other provisions, or (2) a referendum to repeal SB 78xx, making it as if the bill was never passed at all.  

Initiative 
Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General, it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary, and another 25 days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary. After either the 15 or 40 days, the Attorney General sends it to the proponents, the Senate, the Assembly, and the Secretary of State. The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date.  That is the day upon which all calculations are made.

The proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures. However, the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters.  Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election, on March 5, 2002 (statewide primaries), and so, could not qualify until the statewide general election on November 5, 2002.  However the window is tight for that election, as well, and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September 2001 to qualify for November 2002.

The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative, but cannot amend it.  So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot.  An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election (419,260 signatures).  The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers. It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly, but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights has been successful at placing pro-consumer initiatives on the ballot before, including Prop. 9 in 1998, which sought to undo AB 1890 before the public understood its ramifications.

Referendum 
Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives, although a successful referendum was on the March 7, 2000 ballot.  Prior to that, the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June 1982 primary election ballot. All four were defeated. Since 1912, there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot. Of the 50 attempts, 39 qualified for the ballot, 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect.  The circulation calendar, verification, timing, and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives.  For example, the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred. The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute, though.  

Political Dynamics 
Notwithstanding the Governor's and Assembly Speaker's desire to enact an Edison rescue package, Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the driver's seat. In fact, as noted above, there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around.  One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout. In fact, members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility, their reluctance fed by generators' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout. 

Currently, due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue, there are not 41 votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly. We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence, and the bill will pass the Assembly.  As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly, the state Senate presents an even larger challenge. However, at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than 50 percent.

The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.

There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.

Please call with any questions.

Jim,

I listened into the call for the PUC press conference and they plan to go forward with the vote tomorrow regarding direct access; however, they will not vote on the rate order until a later time due to the high volume of comments (they predict it will be voted on before Sept. 20th though.)  Let me know if you need more info about the call.  Thanks, A.

?	Davis's transmission deal essentially dead
	As reported early, the primary sticking point in Davis's deal with PG&E was over PG&E's legal obligation to supply California with power, given the state's net short position this summer.  As a result of last night's ruling, the net short position doubles this summer and Davis is not willing to let PG&E out of these responsibilities.  The legislature also recently discovered, in a draft of the transmission deal, that the deal removes the CAPUC's rate setting powers, meaning rate hikes are a strong possibility.  According to sources, the legislature "is in horror" at this discovery and will absolutely not let this happen.

?	Davis becoming very unpopular with the legislature as they realize the term of LT power contracts
	The legislature is also growing increasing more angry at Davis as they realize the LT contracts negotiated with Davis will not fully come into affect until 2004.  Additionally, many legislatures are discovering, as they return home, that they are losing popularity in their districts and are having to face angry constituents.  As a result, Davis's creditability is starting to suffer and he losing support of both Democrats and Republicans. 

?	Davis warns senior Republican leadership not to publicly make waves
	Davis told senior Republican leaders that if they start talking to the press and pointing fingers at Davis and his lack of solid solutions to California's problems, he will "drag both Pete Wilson and the previous administration through the mud" as the original source of the deregulation debacle.

?	Last ditch efforts could be made regarding rate hikes, however doesn't address past debt
	Davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort, but this action would not address the undercollection  issue.  There is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators, commercial paper holders, and (less now but still very possible) the QFs as time is running out (forbearance period ended March 13).

CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote 
Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a "preference payment" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.  The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

Here is the latest......
Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker last night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since it is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline.

Court Case Denies Rate Hikes

As forecast in our report yesterday, the Federal Court in Los Angeles refused to allow the two California utilities to raise rates to recoup undercollections of their power costs since last August.  We had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities, but push the rate hike question to an appeals court.  Instead, Judge Ronald Lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until March 5th.  The utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short-term rate hikes.  Edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $200 million payment today and a $600 million payment on Thursday.  Absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes, the Governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position.

Bankruptcy Grows More Likely

Regardless of the legal technicalities, the bottom line is the same.  As we have cautioned since last Wednesday, there is a serious risk that a creditor or
group of creditors could push for bankruptcy, perhapsas soon as tomorrow when the period of forbearance agreed to by financial creditors runs out.
Before this ruling, there was reasonable assurance that the utilities would be restored to health by their court victory. Now there is real fear a coherent deal is 
unravelling, and that it will not take much for a small group of financial creditors to break ranks. And the prospects for supplier creditors now look
much bleaker and more dangerous. And there is an increased temptation for the utilities to declare bankruptcy and take their chances with a judge rather 
than the California assembly. The politicians will try to find a way to prevent bankruptcy, but it will now be difficult.

Disarray in the Legislature

For now, the only card still being played is the "I give you a dollar, you give me a hot dog" plan, as State Senator Burton accurately summed it up. The state
 pumps money into the utilities in return for some kind of asset -- warrants, transmission lines, whatever, anything that can be brandished in front of the voters as
proof that the utilities suffered and paid. But "there is little or no energy among legislators for either of the proposed solutions," one senior figure in Sacramento
 told our source yesterday afternoon. "Legislators are running scared. And I don't know of a single legislator in either house, on either side, who has the slightest
sympathy for the utiltiies now. They think the utiltiies have either been incompetent or shrewd or both." The ruling will in all likelihood send officials back to the
 drawing board. "Davis will propose a kind of shadow plan by Friday, but there will be no real substance in it. What are we supposed to do in just four
days? There will not be a real substantive plan for three weeks, I think, at the earliest." That period of uncertainty and lack of energy in the legislature could 
panic the creditors now.

Bankruptcy Court

If Davis fails to cobble together a last-minute deal for rate hikes and some kind of purchase of transmission assets, then all parties will have to do a workout
 in federal bankruptcy court.  The most likely scenario (which we flagged last week) is that the small IPPs file an involuntary bankruptcy against Edison, followed
possibly by PG&E.  Involuntary bankruptcy would shield the utilities from creditor lawsuits and temporarily relieve them from debt payments.  There is also
speculation in the press this morning that some creditors are talking about a Ch.7 or liquidation proceeding, but that cannot yet be confirmed by sources.

FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline.  Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.  

FERC found that There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                     
     represent prevailing market prices.
          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
     is willing to buy at.

FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.

As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

Jim

     Portland General Electric Company         Docket No. ER01-2097-000

     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000


ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE

                           (Issued July 20, 2001)

          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed
     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland
     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate
     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using
     the EnronOnline trading platform.

     I.   Background

          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in
     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000
     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-
     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through
     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication
     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on
                 1
     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing
     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which
     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there
     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to
     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous
     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,
     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their
     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

               1
                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,
          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-
          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view
          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly
          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather
          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in
          buying from and selling power to third parties.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-
          and ER01-2103-000

     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions
     different than those in place but that, they state, will still
     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's
     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's
     requirement that "PGE post on its website notice of a potential
     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the
     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since
     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
     provide for a waiting period before consummating the
                  2
     transaction."   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the
     ability to buy or sell power "from perhaps the largest marketer
                                                                3
     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers."

     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests

          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal
     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),
     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with
     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before
     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.

     III. Discussion

          The Commission allows power marketers and their public
     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates
     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can
     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at
     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers
     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the
     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization
     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate
                                                             4
     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.
     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various
     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent
                     5
     affiliate abuse.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-
          and ER01-2103-000


          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to
     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the
     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI
     using EnronOnline, will be required to "take the transaction
     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular
                                                              6
     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment."   In
                                                                  7
     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or
     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction
     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their
     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.

          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at

          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer
          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-
          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its
          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same
          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the

                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would
          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While
          Applicants do not define "Limit Order," the common understanding
          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to
          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit
          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when
          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which
          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-
          and ER01-2103-000

     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market
     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI
     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is
     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be
     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,
     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.
     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted
     electronically and is available to all market participants,
     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to
     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and
     conditions that are available to PGE.

          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,
     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its
                                           8
     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of
     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse
     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for
     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps
     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an
     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and
     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's
     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline
                                        9
     represent prevailing market prices.

          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
                          10
     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media
     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be

               8
                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases
          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate
          power sales).
               9
                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
               10
                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a
          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI
          is the buyer.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-
          and ER01-2103-000
                                                              11
     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.
     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product
     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be
     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via
     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-
     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically
     trade those products to attain similar benefits.

          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now
     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions
     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.
     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE
     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed
     restrictions that would require PGE to
     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate
     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with
     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same
     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or
     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.

          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited
     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from
     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,
     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-
     market prices.

          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal
     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline
     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's
     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,
     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would
     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.

          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed
     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their
     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating
     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.







               11
                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and
          sell at higher prices.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-
          and ER01-2103-000

     The Commission orders:

          Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,

     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	MOU Passes Assembly, Faces Fight in Senate
? CPUC Direct Access Delayed by Senator

SoCal Developments
As reported in the press this morning, the bailout passed the Assembly late last night by a 41-32 vote.  It will now head to the Senate, where very significant opposition is expected.  Along with his opposition to the changes made in the Assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout, Senator Burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for SoCal's transmission assets.
 
Senator Places Hold on CPUC Direct Access Vote
Regarding the CPUC's decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures (which led Treasurer Angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re-timed), this delay is due to a bill by Senator Burton that passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee yesterday.  Burton's bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement (from Governor Davis) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in DWR ratemaking, as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power.  In doing so, Burton's bill preserves more PUC authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the PUC - thus the delay in action.
 
PG&E also supports Burton's bill, which is very likely to pass the Assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign.  If this bill is signed, PG&E's legal challenges to the DWR and PUC may be canceled.  The popularity of Burton's bill (as opposed to the rate agreement from the Governor) is leading many observers to conclude that Burton has replaced Davis as the most powerful, influential politician in California.
 
Burton's goal is to ensure that any direct access that is offered to large users in 2003 (when there will be a dip in power procurement by DWR, resulting in a net short) is only temporary and does not turn into a "jail break."  DWR's power procurement will rise again in 2004; Burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from DWR at that time.
 
The CTMA is opposed to Burton's bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered.  The CTMA wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the DWR (and therefore paying off the bonds) permanently in 2003.

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
?	Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
?	The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We think this is doable."
?	The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
?	Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
?	Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel "frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
?	The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this may be unnecessary.
?	The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a dedicated rate 	component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of their 	claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated through a 	dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to strike a deal 	for PG&E.
?	Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell of pieces of 	the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a lifetime stipulation on 	how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as $5 billion if 	it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the bankrutpcy judge to quell 	the protests against such a plan that would very likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly 	believe that the Judge Montali would support this idea.

A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow "capacity" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Executive Summary

?=09The likely outcome of the 16 May elections is a victory by the BC Liber=
al Party (currently holding polls at 70%), a pro-business, right-of-center =
party led by Gordon Campbell. =20
?=09Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libe=

?=09A low snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission =
and public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could=
 force BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts=
 expire
?=09BC Hydro's additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable

Liberal Party Platform

?=09Income tax cut that would make BC's income tax the lowest in Canada
?=09Independent audit of the province's books amid allegations of NDP misma=
nagement and incompetence
?=09Review of all Crown corporations (including BC Hydro) to enhance effici=
ency and management quality
?=09Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax=
, the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the privati=
zation of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission assets, =
as well as increased government support for independent power producers and=
 coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and attempts to es=
tablish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack =
of clarity about the province's overall energy strategy over the next few y=
ears.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding =
coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, "an asset that we want=
 to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC."  A hig=
h-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the province back alo=
ng the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new techn=
ology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environment=
alists.  "These are confrontational moves, and people will be on the street=
s."=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature =
after the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party's energy=
, mining and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if rig=
ht-wing Liberals are dissatisfied with the party's performance after the Ma=
y election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this g=
ives Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a hi=
gh-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
 would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The B=
C government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991 (=
roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the uti=
lity's ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and invest in=
 the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund, so=
mething that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly int=
ends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls for =
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C Hydro's out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given the=
 low snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Sup=
porting this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hy=
dro's key trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to=
 rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over=
 the next few years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not=
 making it through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a l=
ow snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and pub=
lic concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may fo=
rce BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts ex=
pire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, "We n=
eed to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producer=
s and consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis." He stated that =
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. "I want to=
 change that big time," he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbell=
 also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and co-genera=
tion plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
 leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, "We have no intention =
of selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission li=
nes, no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling th=
eir reservoirs."  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29=
 April that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commen=
ted that Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regardi=
ng BC Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, trans=
mission lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening th=
e sector up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
 part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
 Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro's distribution channels and its ene=
rgy trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Li=
beral finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (=
after Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro's non-core bu=
sinesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing, coul=
d come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro's Williston hydro-generation facility=
 are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170 Gw=
hs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan's additio=
nal generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease op=
eration if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close to the M=
inister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that levels a=
t Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzie's operational l=
imits due to concern over political backlash.=20

In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.

Best,
Jeff

Commissioner Wood has issued extensive questions on direct access, continuing his harassment of ESPs.  He raises the issues of moving the termination date back from September 20 and supposed cost shifting.  He also asks for copies of contracts with customers and extensive information about those contracts. Comments are due Nov 2 with replies due Nov 8.  We plan to respond aggressively through our coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM). We WILL NOT be providing any contract information.

There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.   Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles).  Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position.  However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout.
Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access.  The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?     Legislative Maneuvering Towards a Bail-Out Plan=20

MOU Developments
The Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee held hearings yesterda=
y on the SoCal bailout plan, AB 82.  The chairman of the committee, Rod Wri=
ght, has agreed with Hertzberg and Davis to move something out of the commi=
ttee, possibly by mid-week.  Much of the Assembly's efforts to move along a=
 comprehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 ame=
ndments.  Additionally, demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort own=
ers opposing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may a=
lso slow the process.

Three Central Valley Democrats (Reyes, Flores and Canciamilla) on the Assem=
bly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability will likely be paying close =
attention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements, as farm=
ers are significant in their districts.  All three legislators face reelect=
ion.  Reyes has already signaled that, even though she voted for the bailou=
t last time, she is disinclining to do so again.  These three Democrats may=
 impede the progress of the bailout.  There are strong indications that the=
 plan will not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass.  At=
 this point there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the Democratic=
 side.

Another substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by SoCal =
for "fair market value" of its transmission assets, rather than book value.=
  This value, of course, would have to be estimated and essentially means t=
hat even more money would have to go toward the bailout.  While Committee C=
hairman Wright would not oppose this idea, it will likely be hard for many =
of his colleagues to swallow, particularly on the Senate side.

Once the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the Assembl=
y Energy Costs and Availability Committee, it will then go to Assembly Appr=
opriations.  The chair of this committee, Carol Migden, is friendly with bo=
th Hertzberg and Governor Davis, so the plan appears unlikely to receive si=
gnificant opposition in her committee.  It will then go to the Assembly flo=
or for a vote.  Since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the =
Assembly, it likely will fall to the Senate to decide ultimately if a SoCal=
 bailout makes it to the governor or not.  Therefore, it becomes important =
to examine what deals might be made between Burton and Davis in order to ge=
t a bailout through the Senate.  For example, Burton wants a change in the =
workers' compensation laws to increase payouts to workers.  This is a very =
important issue.  On the one hand, both trial lawyers and the unions suppor=
t Burton.  On the other hand, he is strongly opposed by the powerful CTMA, =
the Republicans and pro-business Democrats, including Governor Davis.  In f=
act, Davis has already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promis=
ed to do so again.  It is conceivable, though unlikely, that a deal could b=
e struck whereby Burton would allow a SoCal bailout to pass in exchange for=
 Davis signing workers' compensation reform.  However, if this were to happ=
en, both the bailout and the workers' comp reform together would be an enor=
mous burden on California businesses at a time when these businesses are no=
t doing well.  This is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely=
 at this time.

This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.
The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

?	Socal and PG&E have both made payments to the state of California (DWR) for power purchases per the PUC order on Tuesday.  Socal made a payment on Wednesday of  $43.5M for purchases between January 19 - February 11 and PG&E paid $61M.
?	Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, has ruled that the media does not have the right to view the long-term power contracts being negotiated.
?	Senator Burton stated on the Senate Floor this morning that legislators need to set their regular session bill unrelated to energy quickly because there would be no rule waivers.  He also noted that there would probably not be a lot of money for anything besides energy, and therefore a lot of bills would probably die in policy committee.
?	In a conference call on Tuesday, SoCal stated to a group of commercial paper holders that it would pay back interest on its commercial paper, which is approximately $30M.  One commercial holder said that since there is no default rate specified in the paper, the default rate should automatically be 10% under California  law.  The SoCal representative replied "we don't think that applies to us."  In other words, SoCal does not plan on paying an added default rate on top of the interest payments.
?	At this time, the Legislature announced they would probably not be taking their Easter break, scheduled for the week of April 9th.  According to a source, Burton is not allowing any passes for any travel or absences.  Hertzberg has gone a step farther and said that any travel has to approved by his office and the member themselves has to come to his office to pick up the tickets.  Some believe this maybe an attempt to push the Republicans into breaking the stalemate on AB 8X (voted down last Friday)currently being debated in the Assembly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?		Northwest Smelters Jockey for Favorable Rates
?	BC Hydro's Rate Freeze Lingers
?	BPA Rates Expected to Rise, California Refunds Doubtful

Aluminum Smelters (DSI's)
On 1 October 2001 the long-term relationship between DSI's and BPA for preferred rates will end as Bonneville Power Administration's new rate case takes effect.  After 2001, DSI's become discretionary customers of Bonneville Power Administration.  DSI's have been playing the game of slowly 'migrating' their load to local utilities in 9.9mW annual increments to avoid being subject to Bonneville's New Large Single Load (NLSL) designation and losing their preferred rate status.  Now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto BPA's federal system, and officials at Bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own NLSL regulations, which were established in 1980.  In an effort to secure existing DSI relationships, BPA is now undertaking a review of its NLSL regulation to provide an exemption for these companies.  

BPA is opposed by the Public Power Council, the representative of the public utilities in the Pacific Northwest that focuses BPA rate-making, which has sent a letter to the Assistant Secretary of Energy to express its objections to BPA's proposed actions.  The PPC was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the DSI's as large industrial customers - they are moving aggressively to block BPA from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment.

The ability of BPA to exempt DSI's from its NLSL regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region.  It remains to be seen whether or not the Public Power Council will initiate a legal battle to stop the DSI's from obtaining this special treatment.  

While moving to maintain positive relationships with the DSI's, BPA is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish.  BPA has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter - they won't really benefit much, even from normal or better precipitation, until the melt starts next April.  BPA wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then.  About the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money they're getting from BPA to subsidize power purchases on the spot market.  However, there would be a lot of risk in that, and BPA people don't think market prices would enable them to be very profitable, even with the BPA money helping. 

As of April 1, three smelters should come back on line; NW Aluminum, Goldendale Aluminum, Longville Aluminum

?	Alcoa Aluminum
There is not much news happening on the negotiating end between Alcoa and BC Hydro right now.  Information is still fairly tight-lipped, however, employees of Alcoa's idled Intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart.  This may indicate the direction of negotiations.

?	Kaiser Aluminum
As odd man out, Kaiser has little to say in Northwestern energy developments.  The company will obviously benefit if Bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities, but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again, though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time.

British Columbia Politics

?	BC Government
The latest news from British Columbia is that the BC Liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy.  Public opinion remains quite high, and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first 90-day period.  Even former NDP legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding.  Political strategists are watching the ANWR vote in the US very carefully, not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through Northern BC, but also because it is illustrating the environment vs. labor fallout.  In the recent election, the Green Party of British Columbia performed surprisingly well, garnering around 12% of the vote in any typical race, contributing directly to the downfall of the NDP.

Premier Gordon Campbell's core review of BC Government is due by October, and it appears that the process will be primarily a cost-cutting measure.  They are moving to reduce expenditures, which for BC Hydro's sake, will include community outreach, student scholarship and any other 'feel good' programs currently being undertaken by Hydro.

The real long-term policy planning, however, is expected to take place in January when Campbell's team (Brenda Eaton, the Deputy Premiere; Doug Allen, the Premiere's consultant; and Jack Ebbels, Deputy Energy Minister) works in conjunction with Neufeld to construct BC's long-term energy plan. 

BC Hydro
BC Hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the RTO West regional transmission organization as a filing utility.  RTO West is currently being overseen by the Western Governor's Association and developed as allowed by FERC.  RTO West will be the oversight entity in the western states and Canada that will manage electricity transmission issues.  We are also expecting Alberta to come on board RTO West shortly.

With regard to a potential rate hearing, BC Hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until 2003.  The word on this move is that it will allow Chairman Bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business, such as transmission and information technology - focusing BC Hydro's core operations on additional generation, exports/trading, and delivery.  The public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket, similar to what happened in California - but Bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze.

As a function of increasing BC Hydro's generation capacity, they are looking very carefully at building on two sites:  Site C (hydroelectric dam) and Burrard Thermal.  

BPA
?	Financial Status
In what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters, BPA dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the FB CRAC on 1 October. This would increase rates over the 46% LB CRAC rate increase announced earlier -- despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary.  What this essentially does is allow BPA to bypass its initial rate case increase of 46%, utilizing a stop-gap measure under federal regulations.

BPA cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an FB CRAC, including losses trading power this summer, changes in the accounting treatment of some DSI buyouts, and uncertainty whether the California ISO and PX can pay monies owed BPA.  BPA did note, however, that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the FB CRAC calculation.  If the FB CRAC triggers by any amount, BPA would have the option of "truing up" its calculation of the FB CRAC in March and could change the rates again if BPA's actual financial condition on 30 September differs from what is estimated now, or if BPA changes its accounting assumptions further.

BPA representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier load-based CRAC increase (of about 46%) -- "much less than 20%, and probably much, much less than 20%."

The Public Power Council staff has written to and met with Steve Wright, BPA Acting Administrator, in an effort to convince BPA that a FC CRAC is unnecessary.  We should know BPA's decision by 31 August.  

?	FERC Refunds
At this time, BPA will not seek refunds in the ongoing FERC proceedings - or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against BPA-for the following reasons:

1)	BPA believes FERC lacks jurisdiction over BPA.

2)	The proceedings are so convoluted (and the transactions so complicated) that BPA asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds.  Insofar as other parties collecting against BPA, in some cases BPA was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of, for example, aluminum smelters.  FERC would have to proceed against these third parties, and often that money has already been spent.

3)	With respect to claims by the Calif. DWR ($71 million), a similar claim in the separate California FERC proceeding was disallowed on 14 June.  It would be incongruous to allow the claim here.  In this claim, FERC denied DWR access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller.

4)	Then there are the assorted politics involved.  First, BPA believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received.  BPA calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa $400 million, while it believes its own potential claims could amount to $500 million-thus a potential $100 million net gain.  For reasons cited, however, we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds.  Second, with respect to others seeking refunds against BPA, five NW senators who sit on the Senate Energy Committee would be very upset if FERC allowed California parties to collect against BPA; and FERC to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment.

BPA is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a 10% chance of their being forced to submit to FERC in this matter.  Of course, if they were forced to submit to FERC jurisdiction, they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds.  

Even if BPA received refunds, we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back on-line.  We anticipate that on 1 April 2002, three smelters (amounting to between 300-500 MW) will come back on line: Northwest Aluminum & Goldendale Aluminum (230 MW), and Longville Aluminum (100 MW).

?	Spill-Related Issues
Fish returns for this year have been especially high.  If the ocean stays productive for the next few years, as some think it might, the region could have an enormous opportunity to rebuild the salmon and steelhead runs and make huge strides towards success in this area.

Behind-the-scenes work continues on the Implementation Plan (on the Biological Opinion on the hydro system), with the region's states and tribes trying to play a stronger role in designing the Columbia River strategy.

PPC and Northwest Irrigation Utilities were admitted to the National Wildlife Federation et al v. NMFS lawsuit as defendant interveners, and the court is now making plans to try mediation between the parties.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Just to alert you.  The new CPUC proposed decision to suspend DA to be voted on next week has some language of concern and I wanted you to be aware of it  This new language, which was circulated today, implies some retroactive action by the CPUC -- but not on the suspension issue.  So, some financial risk is possible.  The language follows.  We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot).

The new draft says ..."we suspend the right to enter into new contracts for direct access effective today.  All other issues dealing with contracts signed before today remain under consideration by the Commission (in response to the comments already received) and will be resolved in a subsequent decision.  In other words, no contracts for direct access may be signed after today; the effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including renewals of such contracts, will be addressed in a subsequent decision."

The "Conclusions of Law include:

"2.  The right to enter into new contracts for direct access should be suspended as of the date of this order.

3.  The effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including renewals of such contracts, as well as comments of the parties will be addressed in a subsequent decision."


And the "Ordering" paragraph states:

"[3.]  The right to enter into new contracts for direct access is suspended as of the date of this order."

"5.  This phase of the proceeding remains open for further consideration of comments of the parties, including the effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including renewals of such contracts."

?	Item 5b of the PUC draft decision, which implements the 3 cent/kwh rate increase, has just passed unanimously. Commissioner Lynch stressed again that this rate increase can only be used by the utilities for power purchases going forward with the only exception being that the utilities must pay the state the money they owe for the power purchased by the DWR.

?	The tiered rate structure was not debated or voted upon.  Lynch said that this cannot be decided until the rate structure is complete and the committee would work on this issue on an "expedited basis," approximately 30 days.

?	Commissioners Brown and Wood explicitly thanked Lynch for taking courageous leadership in spearheading this decision.

Summary
Gov. Davis is expected to announce a plan today, however, there have been no breakthrough deals in negotiations that would support a plan.  
Sources report that at least 7 or 8 Democrats have indicated to consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield that they would join Republicans in blocking any proposed bailout by Governor Davis.  This coalition would be enough to kill any transmission purchase proposal.
The emergency legislative session is closed, after which all current legislation would need to be introduced in a new session.

1. Bankruptcy Outlook
An advisor to MBIA* is attempting to pull other creditors into an informal pre-petition committee.  However, the creditors are finding that their interests are not always the same, and inter-creditor politics are becoming very active at this point.  For instance:

	- BC Hydro is not inclined to take aggressive action, even though they are one of the biggest creditors.  As their power is hydro, they are operating with a huge margin - i.e., they do not owe any other companies for gas used to produce their power.  

	- Reliant, using the "squeaky wheel" theory, took a hard line with the governor and succeeded in extracting a partial payment from DWR in exchange for a 30-day agreement to supply power.  Other creditors have seen this and are thinking along similar lines.

	- The generators and QFs as a whole are not very organized yet.  The QFs are negotiating with the state on reducing the amount they are prepared to get paid for the power they supply, but the negotiations reportedly are not going well, and there is no deal in sight.  Reportedly the state has offered to pay the QFs $.07/kwh, but the QFs want $.09/kwh.

*MBIA is a credit insurer.  In other words, if a company issues revenue bonds, MBIA, for a fee, will reimburse the bondholders for their losses up to a certain level (e.g. the first 10 -15%).  I believe it at one time stood for Municipal Bond Insurers' Association.  They have a AAA rating.

2. Legislative Activity
Once the extraordinary session is closed by the Governor it ends and all bills in that session are dead. They would have to be reintroduced with new bill numbers and run through the process again. If the bills have already been heard once in committee it is probable these bills will be taken up for a vote.  The legislator is having so many hearings on bills this week to try and get as many through before the extraordinary session ends.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09Bankruptcy Fears Mount With Absent MOU or Plan B=20
?=09California PUC Wagers the Promise of QF Payments=20
?=09SoCal Ring Fencing
?=09California Budget having Problems

Bankruptcy Fears & Plan B=20

Sources are becoming more pessimistic regarding the prospects for a state b=
ailout of SoCal.  At this time the negotiations on Plan B appear to be in d=
anger of falling apart.  The governor's efforts to position the legislature=
 to take the blame if SoCal files (due to lack of movement on the MOU) and =
Senator Burton's hostile response that the governor is the one responsible =
for delays is a sign that sentiment toward working for a bailout may be dis=
appearing.  It now appears more likely that a Plan B alternative to the MOU=
 will not be reached due primarily to a failure to achieve consensus on how=
 to spread the burden of the dedicated rate component.  This could likely l=
ead to a SoCal bankruptcy filing in the foreseeable future and as sources n=
ote, parties to the crisis are not optimistic about reaching a deal. =20

CPUC Moves to Pay QFs
According to media reports on the CPUC QF payment plan, SoCal's payments to=
 QFs are contingent on the legislatures' approval of the MOU.  In a move to=
 publicize their cooperation and facilitate this process, today the CPUC pa=
ssed three of the four MOU provisions set by Davis/SoCal Ed negotiations an=
d promised to examine the last provision at their June 28th meeting.  Thus,=
 with the CPUC posing no hindrance to stabilizing SoCal Ed., the legislatur=
e will bare the burden of debating the MOU or Plan B.  Sources report that =
if it appears that no legislative solution can be achieved, the QFs could f=
ile involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal.  Yesterday's decision raised the =
state's price cap on the QF's substantially, and ought to help increase pro=
duction.  So once again, price caps have kept crucial power generation asse=
ts off the market.  Sources note that the QFs contracts with SoCal now have=
 cancellation clauses built into them in the event of SoCal filing involunt=
arily- this is something the QFs learned from the experience of PG&E's fili=
ng and Judge Montali's subsequent rulings.  The financial question about th=
ese payments to QFs is less whether they will in and of themselves bankrupt=
 Edison, than it is whether other creditors force Edison into bankruptcy ra=
ther than see that money leave the building. The sums in question are not h=
uge, an absolute maximum of $50 million, but we are told some bondholders m=
ay well consider $50 million to be a sum worth fighting for.

Ring Fencing

Edison International (EIX) has issued a $1.2 billion bond via its Mission E=
nergy subsidiary, proceeds of which will be used to pay off certain credit =
lines with banks. Sources report that paying off these credit lines will ne=
gate cross-default clauses in those lines, and insulate EIX from the effect=
s of a bankruptcy at Southern California Edison. This is exactly what PG&E =
did a few weeks before filing Chapter 11, and has further convinced a lot o=
f people that the game plan at EIX includes letting SCE file and restructur=
e in bankruptcy rather than outside of it. Sources comment that when Judge =
Montali approved large bonuses for PG&E senior management after PG&E's fili=
ngs, it made Bryson and members of his team "reconsider" the merits of bank=
ruptcy. =20

California State Budget:

Day-to-day stress relief notwithstanding, the California state budget is st=
ill a shambles. More than $8 billion has been paid to power generators, dep=
leting a political treasure chest which was going to be doled out to specia=
l interest groups for years to come. The only hope for the state comes from=
 the issuance of $12.5 billion in "Power Bonds." Financial market participa=
nts are still questioning whether the State of California is illegally decl=
aring itself to be a senior creditor of the one (soon probably two) bankrup=
t utilities. By declaring that CPUC rate hikes be directed first to holders=
 of "Power Bonds" rather than general creditors of the utilities, the State=
 is saying that the money they spent buying power "on behalf of the utiliti=
es" is a senior claim. The state Treasurer Phil Angelides has given repeate=
d assurances that this is so, and will likely do so again in a conference c=
all next Tuesday, but concern about this opinion reportedly dampened enthus=
iasm for a $1 billion G.O. bond California issued this week. One highly res=
pected Sacramento columnist said this week that the "Power Bonds" are no be=
tter than 50-50 to get issued at all.

Executive Summary:
?	Undercollet Remains Sticking Point for Utility Creditors (especially QFs), involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today's CAPUC hearings
?	CAPUC Rate Increase Set at 40%, Pending DWR Power Purchase Details
?	Davis Defends No Rate Increase Position, Distances Himself from CAPUC

QF/Generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy
As reported last week, QF has sitting and waiting to hear what the CAPUC has to say, unfortunately it may not be what the QFs want to hear.  The utilities' undercollect, which will not be addressed in today's CAPUC hearings, could very well provide an invitation for QFs and generators to file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal and PG&E.  Recent rate hikes proposed by the CAPUC specifically dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt, leaving the QF with little hope of recovery.  QFs were obviously dismayed by the CAPUC's draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads, an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

CAPUC holds rate increase hearings today
As reported yesterday, Loretta Lynch released the details of the CAPUC's draft rate increase order last night.  There is expected to be a 3 cent/kwh surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40% rate increase.  A portion of this "surcharge" will be given to the DWR to cover its costs and the order concludes that utilities need revenues on a going-forward basis.  Therefore, utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt (ex. QFs).  However, the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the QFs on a going-forward basis.  The net effect of the order is to allow the utilities to operate in case of bankruptcy.

One interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the utilities to join  with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount overcharged for power by the generators.  The suggestion is that the utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds.  Only the funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities' past debt.  If the utilities choose this course of action, it would be a very lengthy process.
  
Davis contends with Lynch on CAPUC rate increases.
Davis has thus far refused to support CAPUC's proposed rate increase stating the CAPUC decision making board is an independent body and that he continues to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure.  Sources indicate that he is likely to ask for Lynch's letter of resignation, however, there is no indication she will comply.  Senator Burton, who supports the CAPUC's plan, reportedly will protect Lynch by not allowing her to be impeached (which is the only other way she could be removed by the governor).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09Davis Swaps Refunds for Costly Power Contracts=20
?=09SoCal Bailout --- Bypass
?=09Windfall Profits Tax In Debate

Refunds and Long Term Contracts
The FERC settlement talks are scheduled to end on Monday, 9 July.  However,=
 as early as today, Judge Wagner could issue a preliminary finding and if a=
 settlement has not been reached by Monday, Judge Wagner is expected to iss=
ue a ruling as soon as possible.  Judge Wagner has made a public statement =
regarding the level of refund stating that $2B was reasonable to him.  By m=
aking this comment Wagner was probably trying to manage expectations on the=
 amount of a refund.  He is viewed as being very savvy and would certainly =
have had "reasons" to make such a public statement (since he is not suppose=
d to comment on cases under review -- and has since, ironically, issued a g=
ag order).  Additionally, since FERC only has jurisdiction over about 20% o=
f the electricity flowing through California, the $2 - 3 B level could be a=
ccurate from FERC's point of view (if you use the Governor's $9 - 15 B esti=
mates as the gross amount). The assumption is that FERC can't order refunds=
 from suppliers over whom they have no jurisdiction (LA Water, munis, Bonne=
ville, etc.), and that any ruling will be limited to that percentage over w=
hich they can exert some force.
Governor Davis also wants to renegotiate $43B worth of long-term powers con=
tracts in exchange for reducing his demand that generators refund billions =
for alleged price gouging.  Speculation on what power generators and market=
ers would agree to refund vary, with lobbyists for California and other sta=
tes predicting Wagner would recommend a refund of $3-5B and those represent=
ing power companies saying it would fall well under $2B.  Wagner has indica=
ted that a refund around $2 B might be acceptable, however, given Davis's n=
ew proposal, Wagner may sweeten the pot by recommending to FERC that  power=
 providers renegotiate long-term contracts and possibly take additional mea=
sures to prevent future energy price spikes.  While Wagner lacks the author=
ity to order the renegotiations of long term power contracts, his recommend=
ation to FERC could lead FERC to issues such an order.
SoCal Bailout
At this time it appears that efforts in Sacramento to work on a SoCal bailo=
ut have essentially ceased. No one is working on a bailout and as we have b=
een saying,  it appears that a bankruptcy is a question of "when," and not =
"if."  Legislators are cautious in pursuing meaningful discussions on the M=
OU until the results of the FERC settlement talks and the amount of the gen=
erator give-back's are known.  Even the CPUC has considered the ramificatio=
ns of current events at FERC and has gone as far as delaying their decision=
 on direct access (until August) at the request of FERC Commissioner Pat Wo=
od.=20
Windfall Profits Tax
There are currently two bills that deal with windfall profits on generators=
. Of the two bills, SB 1XX appears to have more momentum because it is furt=
her along in the process and does not make any exemptions for those entitie=
s contracting with the state for long-term contracts.=20

SB 1XX (Soto) - Windfall Profits=20
This bill imposes an Electric Windfall Profits Tax on sellers of energy in =
California if the sales price exceeds $80 per MWh or another amount determi=
ned by the CPUC.  Revenue generated from this tax would be distributed, in =
equal amounts, to personal income taxpayers in the form of a refundable inc=
ome tax credit.=20
*   This bill was set for hearing on 2 July Assembly Revenue and Taxation, =
but the hearing was postponed until next week due to budget deliberations.=
=20
*   This bill passed the Senate Floor on May 17, 2001 on a 23-12 vote. The =
"nay" votes were cast by Republicans.=20

*   This bill is supported by consumer groups and opposed by several genera=
tors including Duke, Dynegy, Reliant, and Mirant. While this bill does not =
provide an exemption for long-term contract holders however, many of the lo=
ng-term contracts have provisions exemption them from any such tax.=20

AB 2X (Corbett) - Tax on Excess Gross Receipts=20
This bill would create an excess gross receipts received by sellers of elec=
tricity and authorizes the CPUC to set the base price above which the gross=
 receipts tax would apply and establishes an initial base price of $60 per =
MWh. This bill includes provisions that the bill would not apply to any con=
tracts entered into between the state and an energy generator. This bill ha=
s opposition from the energy generators and is currently pending on the Ass=
embly Floor.

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

We executed final documentation on sale of the Noram rig for $9 million ($4.4 million net to Enron).  Although the purchaser has until April 13th to fund, there are no contingencies in the contract and SCF Partners controls the entity.  The delay in funding is required since there is a 21-day period for them to make their capital calls.

A number of things came together for us this week, which is good.

The week is now over.

Today we negotiated a handshake agreement with Smith Properties to buy out JEDI's position in Inland for $2 million ($1 million net to Enron).  The DASH minimum was $1.25 million ($612,500 net to Enron), the original offer.  Documentation will be simple:  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it.  Expect to close and fund next week.

Given the Inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred, I view this outcome as very favorable.

Brandi Morris' work on this transaction was outstanding.

Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

There will be a press conference by the Assembly Republicans at 10:30 a.m. PDT to announce their counter-proposal to the MOU.  This should give further insight and generate market reaction as to whether SoCal can be saved.  The Republicans are almost certain to offer something less generous that the original Davis transmission line offer.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?		Legislators Prepare to Address SoCal Bailout Options 
?	$5.7B Revenue Notes Request in State Treasurer's Hands

Bonds & Bankruptcy:

The Edison MOU is expected to be the major issue on the political agenda this week, and the legislative leadership wants to pass some bail-out measure by this Friday (8/24).  While analysts are confident that there will be an MOU passed, many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the Assembly.  The Davis Administration has said proceeds from the November bond sale will be used to repay the $6.2B borrowed from General Fund to purchase energy.  However, repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern. And PG&E is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes PG&E.

Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout (i.e. without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation).  Thus, he is essentially saying his members will vote for Assembly Member Rod Wright's proposal, and no other current plan.  But Wright's proposal does not have much support from Democrats.  Sources report that at least one prominent legislator, Senator Mike Machado, has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an MOU.  Others may be muttering similar things, but an MOU is still likely.

Strangely, though, no discussions were held at the staff level this week on MOU legislation.  The key driver in the MOU debate is how much of a "haircut" SCE will be required to take (as a hit to the parent company).  Sources report that SCE will accept a haircut of $500M. However, should the haircut be placed in the range of $1B, we are told that SCE's Bryson has informed his team that he would take SCE into bankruptcy voluntarily. This represents a significant turnaround in SCE's previous optimism, which is attributable to legislative indifference to the SCE bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between Bryson and Governor Davis.  As for the middle range between $500M and $1B, it is difficult to ascertain how high SCE will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger.

Short Term-Anticipatory Notes

State Controller Kathleen Connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $5.7B short term note (possibly in the form of a Revenue Anticipation Note/RAN) to cover California's electricity costs until November, when $12.4B in state bonds are expected to be issue by the Legislature.  The State Controller's request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the Treasurer at any time she determines that the General Fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the Legislature.  Connell claims the RAN, which could be offered as early as September, is necessary because the state's general fund is running dry from recent power purchases.  

State Treasurer Angelides is studying the plan, but has yet to publicly comment.  According to sources, he has also yet to comment to legislators, but was in New York last week meeting with people on Wall Street about the bond issuance.  Mandated by state statute, Angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the Legislature or anyone else.  He has total discretion on the issuance, its timing, and its amount.  However, the state's general fund would not be depleted by November 15th, even without the RAN revenue.  RANs are not that unusual.  RANs were previously issued from FY 95-96 through FY 99-00 with the largest being the $5B RAN in FY 92-93.  Because of California's recent economic growth, RANs were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year. 

Concerns surrounding the PG&E suit filed earlier last week (PG&E seeks priority in the $12B revenue bond allocations) are somewhat eased by a well-placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes' issuance.  However, there is suspicion among some that the Administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure, and is thus promoting the idea that PG&E's actions are responsible, rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and DWR contracts.  In the event that the revenue bonds' issuance is delayed past the October 31st bridge loan maturity, the interest rate charged to the state would reportedly jump from four percent to seven percent.

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.

Best,
Jeff

Our source reports the following regarding  today's developments. In sum, due to the governor's sudden panic and  resultant willingness to negotiate, all parties are in a wait-and-see mode that  makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing  early next week.  Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome, but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend.  Creditors, especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations.

The events given in this report are  chronological:
 
- The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to  the utilities this morning contained the following points:

The parent companies of the utilities would have  to return to their subsidiaries $1.5 billion.  This money was originally  tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it  to pay taxes.  However, as was revealed in the audit, this money was in  excess of what was needed for taxes in reality.
The state would purchase the transmission assets  for $3.5 billion.
It was proposed that the utilities would issue  bonds to pay for the utilities' undercollection.  These bonds would be  secured against a "distribution charge" added to power bills.  This money  would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities, thereby involving  the state, but with less than a "full faith and credit"  commitment.

- In contradiction to preliminary reports that  appeared in the press, this plan was rejected by the utilities.  One reason  for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets.
 
- While the bondholders pressed for further  negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached; this is  because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators. The generators,  however, demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to  move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing.
 
- Local sources report that Governor Davis  "panicked" at this point.  He then offered to purchase the transmission  assets for $6 billion (almost twice the earlier offer) and pay the generators'  undercollection (which amounts to $9 to $12 billion).  Reportedly, the  suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail-out was 15  years, which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail-out.  This  plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill.
 
- At this point, consumer advocate Harvey  Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer's office.  Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan, he would start a  referendum to counter it.  Rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the  emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place.  Knowledgeable  sources advise that it would be "very difficult" for the bonds in the plan to be  issued in less than 90 days; therefore, Rosenfield poses a credible  threat.
 
- In subsequent negotiations, Governor Davis has  offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $6 billion,  but possibly as high as $12 billion.
 
- Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is 'very  upset' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so  easily.
 
- Mike Florio, another consumer advocate, contacted  Gov. Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail-out, as it  appeared Davis intended to do, was "ridiculous."  Florio and the other  consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the  referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action.  The consumer  advocates strongly feel that the generators have to "take a hair cut" as part of  the solution, as well.
 
- The governor will announce later this afternoon a  "framework" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a  state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities,  but with state support through the DWR.  However, the state government has  yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework, and it remains unclear  whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties.
 
- With this announcement, the bondholders  may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the  final agreement will be.  The generators, while more inclined to file  themselves, may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it  may be worthwhile to wait and see, as well.  They are interested not only  in the terms of the agreement (and particularly the amount paid for the  undercollect), but also in the terms of the long-term power contracts that the  state must negotiate.  For example, if the state is willing to purchase  power at high prices in order to placate the generators, they would be very  likely to go along with the plan.

Briefly:

The hearing that was planned to focus on UC issues has been postponed, although per the attached there will be a discussion concerning the impact of Energy Service Providers turning their customers back to DWR/utility service.


Also, the Federal Judge has scheduled the UC/CSU - Enron Energy Services hearing for April 11th.  UC had requested an immediate review versus a procedural 35 days to schedule.  The schedule reflects a more procedural answer.  

More as we get information.

Subject:	Thursday Hearing

Per Sandy, it sounds like there is going to be a budget committee hearing on Thursday to discuss DWR procurement and the effect of marketers returning customers to utility service.  It looks like we may be asked to provide testimony (but not about any customer specific issues).  Mike Day would be the right person to provide that testimony if needed.  I'll pass on any more details as I get them.  MDS

There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension


Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

Executive Summary:

-CPUC likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow, politicians bowing to the inevitable
-Many questions still unanswered, most notably size/structure of rate increase and past utility debts
-Past undercollect major sticking point, with little help available from transmission deal or long-term contracts
-Reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders; large generators increasingly angry with Davis' "blame game"
-QFs waiting for details of rate hike; new price formula crucial to SoCal's ability to make payments
-Bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex, but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure

In our late Friday report, we wrote "Davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort, but this action would not address the undercollection  issue.  There is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators, commercial paper holders, and (less now but still very possible) the QFs as time is running out."  Events are unfolding exactly along these lines.

1.	Why Rate Hikes Now?
CPUC President Lorretta Lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes.  Davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution, but that there is a potentially painful political price attached.   Davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system, passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users.

Other California politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes.  The CalEnergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors, who are now able to sell outside the state, if they can get similar relief from the courts.  And it's not just the QFs--the giant Reliant Energy is appealing to the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco against Federal Judge Frank Damrell's series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to California.

2.	What Impact Will the Rate Hikes Have?
Rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward, but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts.  Some form of rescheduling is a possibility, but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities -- if they don't seek protection from creditors themselves.

3.	Undercollection/Net Short Still Unaddressed
All of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan.  Still, the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well.  The bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the DWR, then to the commercial creditors.  Absent the transmission line deal, the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect.  Long-term power contracts are still relatively meaningless until 2003, when the majority of the contracts kick in.

4.	Large Power Suppliers Losing Patience
Relations are also deteriorating between Davis and the large power suppliers.  Davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations, talking to several of the main CEOs almost daily.  But state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves.  This is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes.  If Reliant loses their case, it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy.  What's more, financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience, and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy.  PG&E in particular simply will not agree to Davis' transmission lines deal as it stands, and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best, albeit uncertain, chance of a return to eventual health someday.

5.	QFs Listening and Waiting
But the largest threat, as we have been saying, is not from the major energy companies.  It is the small companies -- known as QFs -- that will be the triggers if bankruptcy occurs.  Remember these two facts: (1) The QFs are a diverse group of 600 companies, and it only takes three of them to force bankruptcy; and (2) many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action.  It is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached, but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy.

Other bullish news: PG&E gets extended forbearance until April 13th from its banks, and SoCal announces that it will pay some QFs.  The actual amount of payments to the QFs is still subject to the CPUC  approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the QFs.  That decision should come tomorrow.

6.	Outlook
Last week we wrote that "the QFs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood, what they can get from the CPUC hearing next week."  The next 48 hours will be crucial.  Only massive rate hikes (40% or higher roughly) would address the undercollect issue and Davis is unlikely to authorize those.

As one source told us, "the age of denial is (mostly) coming to an end, and that is the main source of hope that California can begin to move forward from this."  But the situation is so complex, and there are so many players and angles involved, that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure.

Louise,

A detailed discussion of all of the assets currently under management by EC=
R is being prepared by Jesus Melendrez and is near completion. I am meeting=
 with Pam Becton in the morning to review the various off balance sheet veh=
icles.  The assets that are in active divestiture process are CGAS and Juni=
per.  An agent has been engaged for the Juniper assets.  We are in discussi=
on with a group on CGAS.  We expect both of these transactions to close by =
year end but hopefully in the 3rd quarter.  The Preston I & II VPPs were sy=
ndicated into Brazos in December '00 and January '01, respectively.  The Cr=
escendo ($7.5 MM) VPP was syndicated into Brazos in December '00.  The rema=
inder of the Crescendo VPPs should be moved into Brazos by year end or 1Q'0=
2 once a second VPP transaction occurs.  The KCS VPP ($159 MM) is set to cl=
ose and fund no later than 6/27 according to Tim Proffitt. Hanson is an acc=
rual and may be sold by year end if no other drilling occurs. Ameritex, Cyp=
ress, Sam Gary/Bonne Terre, Vastar, Texland are assets that are still in de=
velopment. Crescendo, Westwin, Nutech and Preston Equity are recent transac=
tions (< 1yr old).  Several options are being reviewed on Mariner - (i) sal=
e or merger with another company, (ii) IPO, provided Enron gets its debt re=
paid and 75% of its equity sold at an enterprise valuation of $500 MM or gr=
eater (the MEGS pipeline asset would be included in this option), or (iii) =
continue to develop the asset.  We will make our recommendation on Mariner =
once Allan Keel completes his analysis.

I recognize that this explanation is brief.  Let me know if you need additi=
onal information or would like to meet to discuss further. =20

Judge rejects Enron request to halt legislative subpoena
By JENNIFER COLEMAN

08/29/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.

   SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Sacramento Superior Court judge rejected energy
company Enron's request to quash a subpoena issued by a state Senate
committee investigating possible price manipulation in California's
energy market.

   Judge Charles Kobayashi denied two of Enron's three motions Wednesday
in tentative rulings, saying the court had no right to interfere with a
legislative subpoena.
   Enron sued the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market
Manipulation in July to stop the subpoena of its financial and
electricity trading records. Among its objections were that only the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate
wholesale markets.

   The committee has sought documents from six energy companies as they
investigate last year's price spikes in the wholesale electricity
market.

   In his tentative ruling on Enron's motion asking for a protective
order, Kobayashi said he was "sympathetic to Enron's concern for
safeguarding its trade secret information."

   But he added that the court couldn't assume the committee would
divulge the confidential documents and Enron's constitutional rights
weren't "jeopardized by delivery of their secrets to the document
depository."

   On the other motion, to quash the subpoena, the judge found the
committee did follow proper procedure when serving Enron officials.

   Attorneys for the committee and Enron will return to court Thursday
on the tentative rulings. Kobayashi set a court date for Sept. 7 on the
third motion, which is a request for an injunction of the committee's
investigation and contempt proceedings.

   Enron officials didn't immediately return calls from The Associated
Press seeking comment.

   Enron officials have said the company is prepared to turn over 25,000
documents that were already in California, but that other documents the
committee wants are in Texas and out of the panel's reach.

   The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over the
documents. A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the
full Senate, which has not voted on it. A contempt report on Reliant
Energy has also been sent to the Senate.

   A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the
company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's
investigators.

   If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it
will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail
reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and
price gouging allegations involving cement sales to the state.
