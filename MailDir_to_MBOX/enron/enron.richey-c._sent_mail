While our webserver up here hasn't been hammered yet, I've been concerned 
about similar issues (web hardware and administration) for awhile up here.  
Given that the web is our primary medium I agree with you and Tim that it's been 
neglected.  

Administration is an ongoing issue and I'm not sure what a good solution for this is,
but relying on Houston for this is not an option as far as I'm concerned (unless they
change their draconian policies).  At the moment Chris Wiebe is officially administrating
our web/file server, but I don't think this is where his interests lie, so I've been relying
on Colin for most day-to-day admin.  This isn't great since Colin is a contractor.  We should
definitely team up on this one as I don't think IIS administration is even a quarter-time job,
but it is vital.  I'm in a similar spot on SQL Server issues - Chris is the admin, but he's moving
more toward the development side of IT with each passing week.  

In terms of hardware, I've been in touch with Houston through Dan Dietrich and spoke
with a helpful individual who is responsible for web servers down there.  He sent me
the following documentation standard which I hope I forwarded onto you (as it's quite
good).  I'm pushing to move to the Houston standard for web servers which is two 
clustered pizza boxes (DL360s).    I just got the price quote for these and it would be 
about 9000 US$ for the two boxes (basically dual proc PIII 930, 512 MB RAM, 2 9GB drives)

You mentioned moving the dev environment from prod, but I'm not sure if you're interested
in splitting the web from the file server.  I think this is a good idea (more for file server reliability
than anything else.)  There's some time critical data up here that we can't recover if we 
miss it the first time, so I'm trying to make the backend as fault-tolerant as possible.  plus,
it seems like it's likely a cheap performance and fault tolerance boost for the web, as well.  

Sorry to hear about your web troubles yesterday, but hopefully it will serve as a catalyst
for us to clean things up.  

Should we set up a call to talk about this?

Cooper -

You may or may not be aware that our production web server got hit pretty hard yesterday. It has yet to be "officially" determined what happened, so I won't give you my opinion... however, many issues that have been festering for some time were brought into the spot light through this ordeal.

At this point, Tim H. and I have agreed on two immediate actions that will be taken.
	1) Our development server needs to be moved to a separate physical box. This will serve as the back-up and fail-over server as well.
	2) Paul Kane and I will pursue IIS administration and security training/certification.

It is our firm intention that any and all administration on either of these boxes will be done by us -- not Houston. Although, this argument has yet to take place.

In light of the working relationship between PDX and Calgary (that we only anticipate growing stronger through this), I would like to hear what conclusions you have come to with the research that you have done regarding hardware and software -- as well as any suggestions that you may have that we should consider. We want to make sure that, with whatever avenue is taken,  we maintain a position of compatibility to share resources and technology with Calgary Fundies...

Thanks!
Bob

Cooper -

I thought that you might be interested in an update to our web server activities...

Our plan (at this point) is to purchase a new production server and keep the existing system as the development server and file server.

This is what we are looking at:
http://www.directpluspro.compaq.com/printconfig.asp?oi=E9CED&dcpqsid=1DMLAVWF98S92G2N00AKHB60TV7UA5HF&BEID=19701

We are planning to purchase two of these (identical of course). We plan to have one mirror the other so the we can balance the load, and also so that (in the event of a problem) one can function independent of the other... the idea the we can literally shut one down without the web site going down is exciting... also, being able to upgrade by simply slapping in a new "pizza box" is quite intriguing...

Any comments that you might have are more than welcome.

Bob

As far as Houston standards, they made sense to me and they seemed to have more expertise in the matter.  

How bad did things get yesterday?

Cooper -

I think that the three of us should talk about this... however, unless Tim H disagrees, we should probably wait until after he has completed the scheduled meeting(s) that he has with PDX & Houston IT regarding the current policy issues. These meeting(s) should happen today or tomorrow. In the mean time, I will review this document.

Clarification question: If we agree that, ideally, Houston is not going to handle administration of these servers, what is the basis of the decision to follow Houston standards? Is it that you agree with their conclusions or that you want to stay compliant? Just curious...

As you point out, these issues have been long-time coming -- and if what happened yesterday is the price that we have to pay to get things running as smoothly and reliably as possible, then I am glad that it happened. Relative to the good that can come from this, we got a bargain!

Take Care,
Bob

Subject:	Confirmed Worm Attack


The alert that we sent out yesterday was only half of what has now been confirmed as a "worm" attack. For those not familiar with the term, a worm is an attack program that automatically launches a new attack from each machine that it breaks into. This particular worm is attacking both Microsoft IIS servers (which we knew) and Sun Solaris systems.

The CERT advisory discussing the worm is attached below. The Solaris vulnerability is a bug that was discovered two years ago, and the patch has been available. Hopefully, very few of our systems will have this vulnerability, but two EBS servers that we are aware of have already been compromised.

Compromised Sun systems are used to launch further attacks and may be seen by others as Enron systems launching attacks. Please check immediately to ensure that all of your Internet facing servers have either had the patches installed or are not running the affected software.

We have contacted  the FBI to report these attacks. If you do discover any other compromised servers please make backups of all logs and files that may have been uploaded to the server. Please contact me if you have any questions at 713-853-9373.

Thanks,

CERT Advisory CA-2001-11 sadmind/IIS Worm

   Original release date: May 08, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running unpatched versions of Microsoft IIS
     * Systems running unpatched versions of Solaris up to, and
       including, Solaris 7

Overview

   The CERT/CC has received reports of a new piece of self-propagating
   malicious code (referred to here as the sadmind/IIS worm). The worm
   uses two well-known vulnerabilities to compromise systems and deface
   web pages.

I. Description

   Based on preliminary analysis, the sadmind/IIS worm exploits a
   vulnerability in Solaris systems and subsequently installs software to
   attack Microsoft IIS web servers. In addition, it includes a component
   to propagate itself automatically to other vulnerable Solaris systems.
   It will add "+ +" to the .rhosts file in the root user's home
   directory. Finally, it will modify the index.html on the host Solaris
   system after compromising 2,000 IIS systems.

   To compromise the Solaris systems, the worm takes advantage of a
   two-year-old buffer overflow vulnerability in the Solstice sadmind
   program. For more information on this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/28934
          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-16.html

   After successfully compromising the Solaris systems, it uses a
   seven-month-old vulnerability to compromise the IIS systems. For
   additional information about this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/111677

   Solaris systems that are successfully compromised via the worm exhibit
   the following characteristics:

     *

II. Impact

   Solaris systems compromised by this worm are being used to scan and
   compromise other Solaris and IIS systems. IIS systems compromised by
   this worm can suffer modified web content.

   Intruders can use the vulnerabilities exploited by this worm to
   execute arbitrary code with root privileges on vulnerable Solaris
   systems, and arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
   IUSR_machinename account on vulnerable Windows systems.

   We are receiving reports of other activity, including one report of
   files being destroyed on the compromised Windows machine, rendering
   them unbootable. It is unclear at this time if this activity is
   directly related to this worm.

III. Solutions

Apply a patch from your vendor

   A patch is available from Microsoft at

          http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-078.asp

          For IIS Version 4:
          http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/critical/q26986
          2/default.asp

          For IIS Version 5:
          http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/critical/q269862
          /default.asp

These are to bring the Alberta Power Decision Support Web Hosting infrastructure up to

Also. I'm contemplating using this configuration to replace the box running
things under my desk at the moment (2 servers required)

Hi Cooper,

Hope you had a good weekend. We were hoping to upload some metered volumes (from the Power Pool) today in to PETE. We appear to missing data (appears as '0' in PETE) for the following days:

May 10 , 11, 12, 14 and 22. 

Could you please re-scrape this data and give me call at ext. 6777 or fire back an e-mail when this data has been re-scraped.

Thanks alot,

Rob

Colin,

I left you a message at your hotel, but will try here as well.

give me a call when you get a chance

work 	403 974 6946
cell	403 512 3312

basically, the olap server is unresponsive (hangs IE when a cube is brought up)  and Chris
can't get a pulse using the OLAP manager.  We're contemplating rebooting the dev box, but
are afraid this will trigger the cube deletions we saw before.  any other tactics you can think 
of?

Cooper

I don't think the new month (5) came through as a dimension in the "Pool Summary" cube.

can you check into it?

found a cheap flight out on thursday at 3pm, arriving in pdx at 5:50
and leaving sunday at 5:07.

does that sound like the right timeframe?

can i crash at your place while i'm in town?

I'm getting some error messages when I try to use the Houston mail server to send out automated messages - it 
seems like 'external' messages are getting rejected (messages going to my enron.com account work fine.)  

the error message i get back is below.

Are you seeing any similar problems?

Hi Cooper,
Spaces are going fast but if you get a check in soon, you can reserve a
spot!
Send $500 deposit to Piedmont Yoga Studio, P.O. Box 11458, Oakland, CA  94611.
Do you have a brochure to fill out a registration form?  If not, just make
sure  I have your address and phone number.  I will send you a brochure later!
Hope you come along!

I've asked around and I think going to Banff to play some golf sight see is a great thing 
to do.  Here is a link for some of the courses in the region.  I'm worried about getting tee
times, so I'd like to plan things out as soon as possible.  I was thinking of spending a night
or two in Banff.

There are a couple of very good courses in Calgary we can play as well - plus general sight seeing.

let me know what you think

love,
coop

Coop:  Bought tickets, only change is that we're leaving here at the crack
of dawn, will arrive about noon on Friday.  Still leave 4th.  I think some
golf would be good, esp if you play, too.  Perhaps your IT friend could
suggest some courses.  Of course he's welcome, too, if he'd like.  It's
probably better if we don't have to change hotels much, unless we want to
spend a day or 2 in Banff.  Maybe we can discuss this weekend.  We don't
need 5 stars but, if it's possible to stay at a place that has a course
affiliation, that could be good.  Maybe you could check out the
possibilities.  Are you in Portland or Canada?  Luv, Mom

Hi all.   Cooper came to see me with a concern about the amount being deducted from his U.S. payroll for EXPAT Foreign taxes.

When I took a look at what Cooper has paid year-to-date, he's already paid US$33,337.44 in foreign tax of the total $47,187.18 for the year.

Please reduce his per pay deduction for Canadian tax to US$865.60 for the remaining 16 pay periods in 2001.  At year-end he should have paid the $47,187.18.

Kindly give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

I've made the appropriate change in the AlbertaPower database, but it won't 
be automatically pushed to PETE since the pool doesn't change the data they 
have on the web (they just send out the letter.)  i.e., you may have to pull it in by hand.

Cooper/Willie, can you arrange to re-scrape the Pool Price for the Pool's web site.
Rob/Karim, can you discuss with John P to ensure that this change is picked up in his DPR.

Everyone else - FYI

Great.  Thanks Camille.

I get into Nashville on 10:16 on friday night and my flight leaves at 2:25 on Sunday.  

Sounds like the christening schedule will fits perfectly into that.  It's exciting that Cameron's
christening will be in front of everyone!

See you soon.

Hey Cooper,

Just wanted to let you know that I spoke w/Chaplain and Cameron's
christening will be at the beginning of the church service (9am).  The
service will be over by 10:15 or 10:30.  This should give you plenty of
time to get to the airport for your 2:40(?) flight.  I also reserved
rooms for you and your parents for both Fri & Sat nights.  Friday you'll
be in Nashville and Saturday you'll stay in Clarksville.  Anyway, just
wanted to pass this info on to you.  Hope you are doing well and not
working too much.  Look forward to seeing you in a few weeks.

Camille

PS--Cameron's very attached to the bumble bee you gave her for
Christmas.  She has to take it to school and music class.

Hi Stephanie,

I believe you helped me set up my EOL trading account (ADM26984) to trade the alberta hourly market and 
I was hoping you could enable me to have read only access to West Power, U.S. Gas, and Canadian
Gas products.  I can't seem to set up myQuotes for these under my ADM account and I can't run my old
readonly account and my ADM account at the same time.  

Thanks.

The biggest thing here seems to be the issue of the reverse lookups. I don't know if transmitting the subdomain is an actual error on our part, but it's certainly something that can be eliminated by configuration on our server- there's a sendmail.cf parameter specifically dedicated to set your domain identification.

In addition, the app I'm using to send messages is still running under NT4.

It may be that the problem rests with Telus up here in Calgary, but it may be 
internal as well.  

In answer to your previous question, no sql dbs are sending these messages out.  
Basically, it's Tim H., Maria Van Houten, and myself.

All:

I started having problems a couple of weeks ago, around the time of our Windows 2000 migration. I worked on this a little yesterday, got past my own problems, and found 3 things:

	1. The command line mailer that I use for programmed email transmissions is blat, and some features weren't working under 2000- upgrading to the latest version fixed this;
	2. mail.ect.enron.com accepts and transmits everything, but relays and receiving servers that do reverse name lookups reject the default domain name that our server transmits. In my case, this is theizen@dserv1.ect.enron.com. The problem seems to be the "dserv1.ect." part, because telling blat to transmit a specific id, e.g. theizen@enron.com, works without problems. I've added this switch to my scripts, and they're all working.
	3. The address that I was testing for Cooper, "4035123312@text.telus.com" is reachable, but the user seems to be unknown.
Tim

I'll need a little time to dig on this one. When did the bounced messages start?

Dan,

Both Portland and Calgary Fundamentals groups use an smtp server located in Houston to 
automatically (with a program) send out messages based on market data.  These messages 
are sent to both internal (enron.com) and external (cellphones, blackberries, etc.) addresses.  

Recently, some (not all) of the external messages have bounced, and Tim Heizenrader and I are
getting a variety of error messages and its not clear exactly what the source of the problem
is (win2k, new firewall procedures, new mail server procedures, errors in sms servers on 
the other end).  Effectively, the problem can be in 4 areas 
	the apps we use to send the messages
	the smtp server
	the enron firewall
	the message recipient servers

As usual, it seems like it may be a combination of these things.

The server we are using to send these messages out is mail.ect.enron.com (which resolves 
to dserve1.ect.enron.com).  Can you tell me if there have been any policy changes regarding
the smtp server (dserve1.ect.enron.com) or the firewall that would affect some but not all external 
messages?  (If so, we need to figure out a way to automatically send messages to external addresses
that is consistent with new policies)

FYI: we have been using this server for over a year and a half, but have never asked anyone 
if we could use it, etc.  

Thanks for your help
Cooper

Dan/Tim,

Good news.  The problem I was having up here was Telus' fault and unrelated to anything Enron related - just
happened to coincide with the problems Tim was having due to Win2K.  

Sorry for the false alarm.  

Cooper

National Desk; Section A 
River's Power Aids California And Enriches the Northwest 
By BLAINE HARDEN 

05/01/2001 
The New York Times 
Page 1, Column 5 
c. 2001 New York Times Company 
GEORGE, Wash. -- Doing something nice for California has never been a priority here in the Columbia River Basin, where high-voltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat. 
Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain at great length, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basin's cheap electricity and water. 
Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of late. Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday, they are skidding into the summer air-conditioning season desperately short of power. In the last year, much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America. 
All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia, utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California -- but at a staggering price. Charging whatever California's dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia. 
With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make still more power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders -- while making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utility luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1.6 million customers. 
Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the region. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power and may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall. 
''This is not nice money,'' said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. ''It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their air-conditioners.'' 
Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin. 
North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000 each, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less than $25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear their children might be kidnapped. 
The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were ''huge'' and ''obscene.'' But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, ''We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.'' 
Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It had a record $88.8 million in profits last year -- more than double its best previous year. 
Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customers, is using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for local residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against power shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility estimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming year. 
Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as now, local needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant and Chelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City. 
Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers. 
''How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity?'' asked Lon Topaz, director of resource management for the utility. ''It would be lousy politics.'' 
An Upside-Down Economy 
The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined with California's deregulation mess to further distort the energy market. Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year's price -- it has strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long-term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south to California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings and a long-distance bonanza. 
As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $440 an acre not to farm. 
Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year by not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight Wall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a cheap long-term contract. 
Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not use, if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year's level. 
For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California's electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of private American utilities have also benefited from California's troubles. 
BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 million in United States currency). 
To celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it had never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for $130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, which have not gone up for seven years. 
''We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight,'' said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of BC Hydro. 
When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operator, which runs that state's power grid, accused BC Hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy. 
''All they do is scream and shout and they won't pay you the money they owe you,'' he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help California in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said, adding that it was California's ''awful mess'' in deregulating power markets that fueled BC Hydro's record profits. 
A Good Deal for Farmers 
In the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the Columbia from the world's premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable lakes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a third of America's hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in the Northwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-voltage transmission lines did not exist. 
The main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in the 1930's, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam in North America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily designed as a water-delivery device for farmers. 
Since then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columbia Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in federal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, which built it. 
In addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out of the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently sells for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that ''no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.'' 
This year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricity from 29 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 million (if it had to be purchased at current market prices). 
In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville is paying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for each acre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County's public utility is paying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land. 
On April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe here in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year, they agreed that it was a good deal. 
Still, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash. 
''This has to be a temporary deal,'' said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms 900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout. ''If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be no takers.'' 
Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting the lifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were interviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table. 
''We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full,'' said Tricia C. Lubach, a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer. ''Not too long ago they didn't worry about where the power comes from. Someday they may think about where the food comes from.'' 
A 'Wonderful Energy Fit' 
A couple of hundred miles northwest of George, in a penthouse conference room that overlooks Vancouver harbor, Mr. Smith, the chairman of British Columbia's most profitable company, explained in mid-April what a pain it was selling electricity to Californians. 
''People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Californians,'' he said. It does not help, he added, that the state is behind on its bills by about $300 million. 
Still, neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose California's money. The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget, which in the last decade has received more than $3.7 billion from BC Hydro. 
''We have a wonderful energy fit,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro's power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians themselves. ''We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us.'' 
BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell power when it is most needed -- and most expensive -- in California. The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power brought from across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucets and zaps electricity off to California. 
''We spill water during the day,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Why? Is it because we can make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants electricity, for God's sake.'' 
Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in the Northwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff so far this year to about half of what is considered normal. 
The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plants and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it. 
''Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates,'' said Paul Norman, head of power operations at Bonneville. 
Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that by late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end.

Hi,

I'm interested in attending Rodney's retreat to Maui from Apr 1 - 10, 2002.

Are there spots open?  If so, can I send a check to reserve a spot?

Thanks,

Hello Cooper,

I just granted CRichey, BGreeni & JZuffer access to Day Ahead Hourly Position.
Currently, Nikolay will enhance this program for SWAP & OPTION. We will notify you
as soon as it finished.

Thanks,

Duong,

just a reminder to enable CRichey and BGreeni to any apps (like day ahead hourly schedule)

also, if you can add swaps to the set of deals that day ahead hourly schedule summarizes, that
would make it useful here.  

Cooper

Tim,

I'll be in portland on Friday (18th) and the first half of Monday (21st).  Jeff asked me
to come down and help him with some California data issues and it seemed like a
visit was long overdue.   I hope to be able to sit down with you and show some of 
the work I've been doing up here.  The only specific issue I have is to get your feedback
on the hydro project we're working on, which is slowly coming together, but I'd like to give
you a general tour and talk about future direction.  Hopefully you're around and can squeeze 
me into your schedule.  

It's hard to believe I've been up here for 5 months!  

	Cooper

Cooper,

Do you know where we are located?

Corner of 6th St and 7th Ave SW.  
Look for the BIG Indian on 6th St.

Later is better for me.
When you arrive, if I'm still in a meeting, ask Terri to get me.

Craig

Do you have any sprocs for the Weather data you were requesting for ChartFX??

Dave,

thanks for your help last week - everything worked out just fine and
i was able to save a bunch of data due to your efforts.  

(fyi - i was logged into two machines up here and neither one of 
them was rebooted when i got back - they were both locked)

Cooper

Bob,

we had the meeting today called your desk at 1pm PDX time with no answer.   not sure what went on there
because we also didn't get your voicemail.  

we'll have to catch up next week.

Didn't receive a call today.... you guys are probably just really busy.

Should we do it on Monday, or just wait until next Thursday?

Bob (and all),

let's postpone until tomorrow (or next week if you're not available) - no need to force the meeting.

can you do it tomorrow at the normal time?

I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon, and will be leaving a little early. Can we do this at 12:00 Portland time?

Hey Andy,

the days are getting nice up here now - the winter was a bit brutal, but i'm getting stoked for the next few months.

it seems like you just moved into that place no the east side.  time flies.

my old apartment was on 15th and Madison and the building was called the La Salle.  
When there were openings, there would be a posting on the front door.  and the building
manager's phone number is also on a plaque there and you could call him to see if he
is expecting any vacancies.  it seems like the beginning of the summer might be a good
time to pick something up.   

take care,

Cooper

Hi Cooper--

I hope you survived the winter up there and are having a chance to enjoy the long summer days now.  Don't know if you've had a chance to come back to PDX, but it's been beautiful here.  (It hasn't been raining very much, you know...)  Anyway, my lease runs out in June and I'm thinking about moving.  Can you tell me what your old complex is called and/or where it is?  All I remember is it's near the east side of the Hawthorne Bridge.

Thanks,

Andy

Great.  Thanks for the info.  I'm happy to see you working on some analysis!  

We're working on a project for email alerts/notifications etc. which should be sweet when it's done - I think
this would be a good place for collaboration, although we're designing something fairly complex.  

also, a possibly very good solution to load/resource balance performance would be to use an OLAP backend.  
you should definitely consider this when you're working on things.  If you go to albertapower and select the 
Data Summaries (tabular) link you can go to some pivot tables we have on line which should give you some
idea of the speed gain from olap (it's a pain in the ass, but you have to add "http://albertapower" and "http://albertapower.enron.com"
to your "trusted sites" in the Tools->Internet Options->Security section.  you may also have to futz with the 
various settings under the "trusted sites" category.  if you take a look, but can't get past the errors, give me a call
and i'll walk you through it.

Hi Cooper,
I forgot to tell you, I did some FTR analysis back at the beginning of the year which was really interesting.  I also did some hydro flows analysis to forecast when the runoff would start picking up.  I did this by looking at previous years unregulated flows and average temperatures for Spokane and Kalispell and discovered that the flows increase dramatically approximately two months after the average temps reach above freezing on a continuous daily basis.  In addition to the Cal ISO OASIS conversion, I'm currently working on a webpage that will allow individuals to sign up for various e-mail alerts/notifications.  I'm also studying the load/resource balance and tweaking it to make it faster (i.e. through indexes, rewriting SQL code to promote optimization, etc.), more robust, and fully automated (through Perl and S-Plus).

Cooper,

There is a great Indian buffet a couple blocks from here.
I suggest that we go there for lunch.

Do you want to see the new offcies before or after lunch?
We can always decide in the morning depending upon how the 
day is going.

How was the weekend?

I was in Canmore and the weather was great!
The climbing was a bit shakey...

i always urine the air

hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I planned to 
write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it.

i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long time and
it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to the 
reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to go back
- just a logistical pain in the ass.  

thanks for thinking of me.

it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because the summer
is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people and i think i'm 
probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't enjoy the office
culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering that i spend
alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate.  

have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with the choice
of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners than great
works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with new york and also
served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and then write a book
about the wild and crazy life backstage.  

i heard you were in a play!  howz that?

coo-per

ok, first you made an appearance in my dream.
then i talked to KT last night (for the first time in, oh, four
months...), and she was telling me about daniella's wedding, and
hanging out with the likes of you.
so i was compelled to say hello.
she says you work hard, and play not enough.
which sounds not as much fun, but more practical, than playing hard and
not working enough.

i neither play hard NOR work hard.  what a disaster.

how are you?
i hope you're doing well.  i hope you're enjoying Calgary (!!).
new york is good.  now that it's warm, i feel sane.  able to walk
places and play frisbee.  the great thing about the east coast, as you
may recall, is that spring and summer feel like a reward for a job
well-done.  or done anyway.

that's it, that's all i've got.
but i was thinking of you, and wanted to say hi.

Hi Kathy,

I was wondering if I could order an Enron Fleece through you.  They don't have them up here in Calgary
and I was hoping to pick one up when I was down in Portland last week, but it seems like you were mostly
stocked up for summer gear (no fleece).

Would it be possible to do this?

thanks,
Cooper

Cooper,

Yes, I am going to cooking this evening.

I always go to Mo Vino since I am co-host.
Last night, Alaina and I picked out the wines.
Looks like a pretty good selection. I think you should come.

Craig

make sure I had a comprehensive list of the projects you've been working on.  Not

Hi Cooper,
Spaces are going fast but if you get a check in soon, you can reserve a
spot!
Send $500 deposit to Piedmont Yoga Studio, P.O. Box 11458, Oakland, CA  94611.
Do you have a brochure to fill out a registration form?  If not, just make
sure  I have your address and phone number.  I will send you a brochure later!
Hope you come along!

Hi Kathy,

I was wondering if I could order an Enron Fleece through you.  They don't have them up here in Calgary
and I was hoping to pick one up when I was down in Portland last week, but it seems like you were mostly
stocked up for summer gear (no fleece).

Would it be possible to do this?

thanks,
Cooper

What's the link??  Two nights in Banff would be good, then Calgary.  Or vice

OK, if they have it there.  We'll just let Dad take a nap in the afternoon
while we party!  Luv, Mom

I've asked around and I think going to Banff to play some golf sight see is
a great thing
to do.  Here is a link for some of the courses in the region.  I'm worried
about getting tee
times, so I'd like to plan things out as soon as possible.  I was thinking
of spending a night
or two in Banff.

There are a couple of very good courses in Calgary we can play as well -
plus general sight seeing.

let me know what you think

Coop:  Bought tickets, only change is that we're leaving here at the crack
of dawn, will arrive about noon on Friday.  Still leave 4th.  I think some
golf would be good, esp if you play, too.  Perhaps your IT friend could
suggest some courses.  Of course he's welcome, too, if he'd like.  It's
probably better if we don't have to change hotels much, unless we want to
spend a day or 2 in Banff.  Maybe we can discuss this weekend.  We don't
need 5 stars but, if it's possible to stay at a place that has a course
affiliation, that could be good.  Maybe you could check out the
possibilities.  Are you in Portland or Canada?  Luv, Mom

Great!

I'll start planning things here.  What do you want to do about
accomodations?  Would
you guys like to make it a golfing vacation?

love,
coop

i plotted the next month, which I think probably look better (at least demand isn't above supply for the entire region)
