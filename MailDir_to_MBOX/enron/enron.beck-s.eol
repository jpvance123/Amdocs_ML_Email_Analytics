since I will be out tomorrow for our meeting, I thought I would send this on

Just a couple of things, since we will not be able to meet this week.

The auditors have started review no. 2 of the management report.  I imagine 
it will take them at least a couple of weeks  per Louise's request, the 
auditors are re-reviewing the management report to ensure that all the 
changes were made and the report is now accurate
I think you are aware of all the new products Dale is working on (!!!) we 
have several things in the works right now, the primary ones being a park and 
loan agreement that will be managed out of Chicago, and reliable power
Lots and lots of ad hoc reporting (see my earlier e-mail regarding timing of 
these reports - we need a decision quickly - this is taking up most of Matt's 
time, and with the additional reports requested, it will take up the rest of 
it)  I have been sending you the weekly reports we are doing to John and 
Jeff.  Louise asked that we provide similar reports for Europe.  We are 
starting this week on these
We really need to push the profiles manager application - we are getting 
swamped with all the new customers and products (Frank was to talk to Mark D. 
on Friday - I should have an update from him today)  this new application 
will save a ton of manual work - this is something we started as soon as I 
took over the group, and also was one of the auditors comments.  Currently, 
we are manually entering profiles directly into EOL.  This application we 
requested will allow each of the depts (Credit, Global and Legal) to enter 
their own profiles into EOL, and we will just become the reviewer of the data 
via daily reporting.  The application has been tested, but due to the fact 
that the IT group is so busy, we have been placed on the back-burner.  I am 
going to turn up the heat on this b/c we are getting overloaded.
New reporting application - we are in the process of testing now.   It will 
probably be at least a month before it is completed.  This is our new Oracle 
application that will replace the Access report Euginio built
Torrey will be attending the 8am meeting for me in the morning and will send 
me notes  this is the weekly marketing/phase 2 meeting
I am currently reviewing the latest version of the price posting agreement to 
determine what our roles will be once we are posting prices on the other 
platforms (looks like most of it will fall in Dale's world)  You probably saw 
the announcement that we are going to post prices on other websites 
(HoustonStreet and True Quote) that was made on Thursday last week.  
Basically, we have 90 days to make this happen.  IT will build the link to 
these other sites, and we will need to ensure that price are reflected 
properly and that product long and short descriptions are accurate.  I have 
read about 25% of the agreement thus far and am developing a list of 
questions and concerns surrounding this.
We still are not including the proper weather valuation in the management 
report - the numbers are not going to be significant, but we need to report 
this appropriately asap.  Any decision here?  We have been working with the 
weather risk groups to determine how to appropriately value the weather 
transactions.  About a month ago, we reached an agreement with them and have 
been waiting on Dave's approval to change the valuation ever since.  
Keith has made some suggestions on how we can improve the Remedy application 
- I am reviewing while I am here  This is the application that the call 
center uses to track issues
I will send you the suggestions Stephanie has for improving the new security 
application - she will document these for me today  A new SRRS system is in 
place via the Intranet. 

stuff for you -
Carrie S. will begin her 6 month assignment now.  She will be in Australia 
for 3 weeks to assist Justin (the PCG person in the Pacific), then to London 
for a month to work with Amita, and the duration will be spent working with 
the London EOL Marketing team
Justin just completed 3 weeks of training on EOL and EOL applications.  I 
think he will do an excellent job - I was very impressed with his questions 
and how quickly he picked things up.


Just send me any questions you have -

Thanks
Sheri

Subject: Killed Trades


It has come to light that there have been a number of  EnronOnline 
transactions which have been "undone" after the fact.

These are situations in which an EnronOnline trade has been completed, but we 
have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not 
have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation.

It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an 
EnronOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which 
affects the audit process.

Therefore, EnronOnline transactions must not be killed. 

Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the 
effect of reversing the impact of an EnronOnline transaction - this activity 
is outside the scope of EnronOnline.

Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a 
system error on EnronOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not 
initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of 
operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to 
verify completed deals.

We encountered a problem with the Sitara bridge this morning and it has 
uncovered the importance of Risk's involvement in watching this - especially 
during the morning hours.  The Sitara bridge failed at 10:35a.m.  and we came 
very close to missing our nom deadlines on several next day deals.  We 
(Product Control) do have a safeguard in place (our IT department is beeped 
if a deal stays in intermediate status for over 5 minutes), but we did not 
receive timely notification of this issue - it was at least 15 minutes after 
the problem started.  We have fixed that going forward - Jennifer Denny and 
Torrey Moorer will be beeped in addition to IT.  

We will continue to make every effort to watch the bridge; however, the Risk 
groups (or some designated individual(s)) must be watching this as well to 
ensure that any deals that fail are entered into the downstream systems on a 
timely basis, and primarily to alert us of any problems ASAP.  If anyone in 
your respective groups need additional training or assistance, please call 
Jennifer Denny at x35824 or Torrey Moorer at x36218. 

I have attached a file with the 35 transactions that were in intermediate 
status (just fyi)


Please call me if you have any questions.

I have received a copy of the recent customer feedback forms which provide a 
powerful compliment to the work which you have all been doing in providing a 
first-class level of service to our customers.

I am very impressed that so many customers have been motivated to make such 
positive comments. Even more amazing is that I could not see a single 
negative comment anywhere in the stack. This is especially impressive, given 
the nature of a Call Center providing customer service to an IT product.

Many thanks to all of you for the job you have been doing. You make all of us 
look good.

Dave

This is probably way more information than you want, but just in case you 
want to see where we are on the audit comments, attached is a worksheet I am 
updating every few weeks to ensure we address all their issues asap.  They 
will (at the request of Louise) be conducting a follow up audit in October, 
and "re-audit" the management report in mid-July.

The e-mail I sent yesterday has an attachment that installs the new version 
of the database.  It worked well in the four computers we used to test it.  
Nevertheless, it failed on Bob Shults's computer (maybe because of a slightly 
different configuration of his computer).  We rewrote the attachment to fix 
the problem.

If the attachment gave you trouble, or if you have not launched it yet, 
please use the one below instead.

Sorry for the inconvenience,



Eugenio

I have an analyst in my group that does not want to move on to a third 
rotation - she wants to remain with EnronOnline.  I want to send her to 
London for 3 to 6 months beginning in July, and need to find out from you 
what the standards are to ensure we are consistent (housing, cost of living?, 
etc.) across Energy Ops.  I think we have done things like this before.  

The employee is Carrie Southard.

Thanks Norma!

Beth,
I know you are at the VP level but I thought I would forward you the memo 
below.
I wrote it to explain to the EnronOnline Call Center the various issues we 
have been having with the "bridge" since they get a vast
number of internal calls when we have a problem. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I should be funneling 
these concerns to a particular person. 
Thanks.

Subject: Bridge Problems

Over the last 8-10 business days, we have had a some issues on the bridges. I 
want to educate you a little bit on what can cause 
"bridge problems".

First, what I want to explain is their is ONE GUI bridge application for 
users (backoffice users) to monitor the bridge but there are MULTIPLE
systems that EnronOnline transactions can be pointed to downstream. This is 
important to understand because if you do not know this ,
it may seem like we are having the same problem over & over; ie "the bridge 
is having problems". But in actuality, it is DIFFERENT 
problems. Still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to ONE 
problem.   

Also, due to multiple systems (Sitara, Enpower, GasDesk, Tagg/ERMS, 
Powerdesk) are listening for messages from one EnronOnline, 
a "bridge" problem could be one of many issues. Some of which are:

 The server for EnronOnline  messenger goes down (doesn't send message to 
bridge to process)
 The Enron network goes down (cannot send message thru bridge)
 The NFS server (Enron main server) goes down
 Sitara server goes down
 Enpower server goes down 
 Tagg/ERMS server goes down
 Deal worker in ANY system gets "hung up"
 Huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems
 Scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re-started on 
Sunday 

and the list goes on.....................................

FYI In the past week & 1/2, the following actions happened, which caused 
"bridge" problems. 

 Scheduled outage for maintenance on TAGG/erms server on weekend was not 
re-started on Sunday (not smart)
 The NFS server (Enron main server) goes down (affected Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)
 Deal worker in Sitara system got "hung up" and servers had to be bounced
 Member of EnronOnline Dev Team changed data for specific tokenised periods 
during trading hours instead of end of day
  (This failed deals in bridge for Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)

One thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office. 
Traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their
position manager application of their system. If they are gas traders, if 
could be Sitara or Tagg system. If they are a power trader
calling, they cannot see it in Enpower. ecetera, ecetera

If a back office person calls, they are watching the monitor GUI and they can 
see deals queing/backing up and know there is a problem. 

We are working to resolve some of these issues, particularily, 
multi-processing tools, as we know the # of transactions will only increase.
Please feel free to email me if you have any questions. I hope this was 
helpful.

See below for explanation of problem on Wednesday.

Subject: Sitara Production Problem


I am forwarding a message that explains the Sitara Production problems from 
this morning. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Karie (36759)




At  9:50am this morning a DealWorker process in the Sitara system became 
unresponsive. 
At  10:00 am it was determined that the EOLBridge in sitara was not 
processing new deal requests
and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning 
properly.
At 10:14, am the Dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted.
At 10:21 am , the EOLBridge began processing deals.

The cause of the is difficult to determine, but indicators point to an error 
in the CORBA product we are using, 
most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of Sitara. This is 
an issue that is actively being addressed.

What are your thoughts on Team Leadership?  Several of the managers in the 
group were using them last year for coaching and I have received very 
positive feedback.   I would like for them to be able to continue with the 
counseling, but wanted to see what you thought.

Thanks!

I left you a couple of messages last week regarding the trip, and since I am 
here, I don't know if we will get a chance to actually talk to each other 
today (especially since it is your first day back in the office), so I want 
to give you the details in case you get a call from Louise.

I know you and I talked about the trip, and that the entire team was going to 
go to London for team building in smaller groups of 4-5 people.  I did not 
think it right that everyone in the group go and Cecilia not be included.  
There is a business reason for her to be here, as she is working on the PCG 
Operations Manual (it is very outdated and needs revising).  The team in 
Houston has made edits, so she will be editing and reviewing the doc with the 
London team for their changes while we are here.  

I was also told that it was Enron policy that employees fly business class on 
International flights.  Louise stated that Sheriff does not want people 
flying business class, but I was not aware of this.  For future trips, 
everyone will fly coach.  I also have Cecilia rooming with Melba to save 
costs on the trip, and others will do the same on future trips if necessary. 

I told Dave about a month ago that we were going at this time, which he does 
not remember...Dave made the comment to me that he feels like he is more 
aware of what is going on in London than in Houston and that he and Amita 
spend at least an hour or two on the phone each day, and that maybe I need to 
report to him instead of you.  I really do not have time to spend 2 hours out 
of my day updating him on every little thing that the group does.  I do make 
him aware of issue/questions, but I think this is overkill.  I told him it 
does make sense for me to report to you b/c we support ongoing operations of 
EnronOnline and are closely linked to the groups that fall beneath your 
organization.

As you can see, I am a little more than frustrated with all this.  I have set 
up weekly meeting with Forester going forward, but I really feel like I 
should be able to run the group without doing much more than this.  My 
decision making should be trusted and I think it has been proven in the 
past.  Even when I do ask Dave questions and we try to get information from 
him, he is slow to respond b/c he is so involved in so many things and he 
becomes a bottleneck of sorts.  I do not want my job to become the person 
that just tells Dave what my group is doing.  If they (Dave and Louise) do 
not feel like I am capable of running the group or doing a good job, I really 
would like to know....

If you do get a chance to call me, please do.  I can be reached at 83035378 
here in London.  I tried to send most of this via e-mail b/c I am in the 
middle of everyone here and don't know how much I will be able to talk.  

Thanks

Call with any questions or comments.  Georganne has reviewed my model and 
assumptions and on the service agrees to the computation.  In addition she 
has asked for volumes associated with the revenues for 1999.  I have enhanced 
the model to calculate volumes associated with the revenues.

I believe that Troy Klussman had contacted many of you to get this process 
rolling but I just wanted to reiterate that we need to get this done as 
quickly as possible.  The questions about EOL revenues and volumes are really 
starting to roll in.  Troy will continue to follow up on the ENA front and I 
will be checking up on London and Global Liquids.  Please call us with any 
questions.  I have attached a file created by Bob Shults that shows 1999 
revenues by product for use as a reasonableness check.  Bob can provide more 
detail if you need it

Subject: Re: EOL Revenues  

Jason,

We are looking for a way to extract Enron On-line revenues and sales volumes 
out of your regular upstream invoicing system that presumably feeds SAP.   
For the first quarter of 2000 (and thereafter) Enron Corp. in  seriously 
contemplating disclosing in press releases, EOL volumes and revenues separate 
from traditional volumes and revenues.  They need to be able to get these 
numbers out of our regular accounting records.  The numbers that the EOL team 
calculates out of their systems (which is not a financial system) can be used 
to verify that the accounting numbers are being extracted correctly.

Currently for ENA,  the EOL trade system feeds Sitara (deal capture) and 
passes over an EOL deal number.  Sitara assigns it's own deal number but 
passes both numbers when it feeds our settlement & logistics system (Unify).  
Unify currently feeds our general ledger but it is not set up to book based 
upon the EOL  tag, we are designing that into our SAP design.  In the 
meantime, we will query Unify and extract the portion of Unify revenues and 
volumes that are EOL.  We will then book  a reclass into Hyperion to separate 
EOL revenues from traditional revenues.    We are currently using numbers 
provided by Bob Shults for 1999 to verify that everything is working 
correctly.  We are finding valid timing differences due to assumptions that 
Bob is making.

Unfortunately, a few of the products that are being traded or will be traded 
on EOL do not feed into settlement systems like Unify but rather are invoiced 
manually.  We are having to identify a way to accurately capture those 
numbers as well, so that they can also be reclassified in Hyperion. 

This project has a pretty short fuse as there is much outside interest in EOL 
and thus a  great need to be able to accurately calculate sales revenues and 
sales volumes.

Please call me with any questions that you have and keep me updated  on your 
progress.

Hi Georgeanne,

Donnah mentioned that Bob Shults has the statistical information you required 
for London EOL transactions but you require more supporting documentation to 
back them up.

Would you be able to send me the reports and let me know the information you 
are looking for.  I will then be able to ask around the relevant people and 
see what we can dig out for you.

Thanks,
Jason

I think Andy will be the one we need to get together with initially to 
discuss Click Paper.  He may want to run it by her, but now that this is 
official, I think we should approach him first.  Any thoughts?

Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count 
steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a 
day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date 
high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.

*  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main 
reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has 
increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since 
January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its 
overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to 
1,018 deals per day.

*  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal 
Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day 
in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average 
daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.

*  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has 
decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from 
359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count 
has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.  
The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.

*  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on 
EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.  
Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in 
February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.

*  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450 
trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month 
of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This 
represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL 
volumes have decreased similarly as well.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a 
daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents 
about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.

I just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on 
Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).  The only real system 
issues we have (outside of EnronOnline IT resources!) are the bridge 
resources.  Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower.  We 
have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and 
nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things).  The problem has 
arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is 
fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three 
individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their 
day to day responsibilities.  When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys 
were left in limbo.  Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them 
were very good at getting back to us for the most part.  

Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield 
last week - the bridges are now part of his world.  This was initiated by a 
memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures.  I will forward this 
to you as well.  Richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured 
us that he will add some structure to this group.  It is especially critical 
when the Sitara bridge goes down late morning, and we are doing next day 
physical deals on EnronOnline.  I have a good working relationship with him 
(from the old Synergi days), so I think this will be great for us.  I 
provided him copies of the IT Compliance flow charts related to the bridges 
so that he could gain an understanding of how they work.   Since this 
meeting, Jennifer has contacted additional resources that Richard referred us 
to, and they have been very responsive (one of the guys volunteered his pager 
and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge...).  So, that said, 
hopefully our only "issue" is correcting itself due to Jennifer's 
perseverance!

Apart from that, we do have an item on our wish list (EnronOnline IT) to 
simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up 
processing time.  Right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to 
determine how to book certain deals - we want to eliminate that thinking by 
adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the 
bridge what to do.  I can give you more details on this if you'd like, but 
this is short and sweet explanation...

Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
ST

Dear Sally:

I am a new member of Jay Webb's EnronOnline technical team.  In my role, I 
have had the opportunity to review the EOL Reporting Database created by 
Eugenio Perez.  Eugenio has demonstrated good technical and problem solving 
skills in the development of the Reporting Database.  He was able to apply 
his knowledge of Microsoft Access and expand his programming skills.  He 
quickly developed an application that served the immediate needs of EOL.  
Eugenio should be commended for growing his technical skills to develop his 
first Access application.

Sincerely,
Chris

Just wanted to catch you up on the events over the past week....and a couple 
of things I want to talk to you about next week

REPORTING:
It has been a continual challenge as you well know.  The good news is the 
individual from EES (Chris Luttrell) accepted Jay's offer today and he is 
going to start on March 3.  
That said, I talked to Chris today and filled him in on where we are and what 
we want to accomplish.  He feels our best option will be Oracle.  
To ensure we are prepared for his arrival next Monday, we are preparing the 
detail of what we are doing today, both our assumptions and all of the 
various data sources for our current management reporting
Also, Dave and I met with Wanda and Georgeanne on Tuesday regarding revenue.  
I believe Dave sent you an update of this meeting.  We are meeting with 
Georgeanne today to go over our assumptions, conversions, etc. to ensure that 
we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report, and to 
ensure that we are capturing all of the Enron data
Customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week, and I think we 
are about there.  There are still some minor differences, but we are working 
to sort through these today (everyone is involved in the tie out).  I will 
review the new report format with you on Monday and we will start sending 
this out then.
We also have an Access person that is working on improving our current 
database since we will have to live with this in the short term.

TRADING ACTIVITY:
It seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify EOL 
deals for various reasons (one being Web latency...they are claiming that the 
deal did not show up on their transaction summary, so they thought it did not 
go through, and they did another deal...and this first deal appeared sometime 
later).  We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these 
deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening.  I 
am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss.
We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong 
entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when 
they should be only executing financial deals.  From my understanding, we 
have "left the door open" for them to trade either way and are relying on 
them to trade under the correct counterparty.  This is causing several 
problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified 
invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that 
they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity).   We need to discuss 
how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes.

OTHER:
I talked to both Dave and Bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on 
new products, etc. to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of 
new products (e.g. Credit Derivatives).  
Help desk news...Matt M. accepted a position with the Remedy development 
team.  We are going to move Noel (he works nights) to the day shift to take 
over Matt's role.  Donna assures me that he is very good.  Sandy Rivas also 
wants to leave the group.  We should be able to handle the volume of calls 
without replacing them.  I need to go over some call statistics with you next 
week.  We have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends, 
and we receive less than .1 calls per hour between the hours of  7pm to 
midnight.  I think we can get away with eliminating weekends, and using on 
call pagers from 7 to midnight.
One question - we currently are considering EES an external counterparty and 
Enron Canada an internal counterparty.  We are now trading with Bridgeline 
Gas Marketing (joint venture with Texaco - 40% ownership).  We need to 
determine what we are considering internal vs external.   I would think these 
would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions...  any 
thoughts?

I know this is a lot of info, but I also know you are going to be in high 
demand on Monday!

I hope you are enjoying your ski trip!!!

Sheri

Here's just a quick summary of what we have going on...(not sure how quick 
this is going to be!)

EnronOnline
Offering products on other exchanges (HoustonStreet and True Quote).  We are 
going to offer specific products (various Gas and Power products) to 
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms.  
Therefore, we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new 
applications built to support the interfaces.  We will be responsible for 
adding/deleting products, ensuring the sites match ours, reporting trades on 
these systems, bridging applicable data to downstream systems, etc.  Enron 
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity.
Opening up EnronOnline to brokers.  We are negotiating with three brokers 
right now.  They will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to 
the site, and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties 
only.  We will also need applications built and establish specific processes 
to support this.
Wish List - we have a list of approx. 180 times that we need the developers 
to work on for us.  Jay Webb committed to Louise a few weeks back (when I was 
in her office) that we would get a resource (specifically Chris Luttrel and 
his team).  I think you are aware of this.  Chris is now moving on to do 
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks.  We 
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the IT team (Mark Dilworth 
and company...).  Basically, since Mark has decided to leave the group, 
nothing is being addressed.  I am going to speak to Dave tomorrow about this 
and escalate from there necessary.  This needs a more detailed explanation - 
I am going to try to get some time with you next week.
Steel - I will discuss with Dave tomorrow.  He basically told me not to do 
anything (another topic of discussion....)
We are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the PCG
Louise has asked that I not allocate any of the PCG time to Europe - I don't 
agree with this because I have four people preparing the management report on 
a daily basis and I have a call center that also supports Europe.  I tried to 
argue my point but did not get very far : )  I am going to talk to Dave about 
it some more.
Working on bridging to Thunderball and the new weather application
Legal/Credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - Credit 
is improving (they hired a new person), but Legal has one person responsible 
for new CP set up (Tana Jones).  When she is out, all application processing 
stops.  I am going to talk to Mark Taylor about appointing a back up at a 
minimum.  Tana does a great job, but our activity is really increasing (she 
also supports Clickpaper), so it is becoming an issue.
We have set another record today - we have already done 3,358 trades!!!!
No new news from Canada on power trading - Legal needs to sign off.  In Mark 
Taylor's shop
Argentina in the works - probably end of month. 

Clickpaper
We have so much, I am not sure where to start.  I had lunch today with Jeff 
Harbert to discuss what our needs were.  We need tools from reporting to 
credit...  
The commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products, and 
are starting to hire marketing people and traders.  The activity is really 
picking up
The contractors are working weekends (Call Center).  I am working the 
Commercial group to discontinue this.  We are not even getting that many 
calls during the week, and we have not received one call on Sat/Sun since 
launch (July)

Commodity Logic
Dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great 
resource (I have received several compliments from the NetWorks team on his 
contribution)
They have not yet released the first module (Financial Mgmt - CFO).  Should 
be very soon

DealBench
No external customers - very slow developing....  Staying involved and in 
touch with the Commercial team

Other
I am still looking for an assistant.  I sent five resumes down to staffing 
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled.  I went down to complain 
and two of them were scheduled.   A week later, the other three were yet to 
be scheduled, so I am doing it myself.  I think we have some real issues in 
the staffing group - this is not the first time.
We are working on Disaster Recovery for the group.  
Super Saturday - I would like our team to participate.  Do you have an idea 
of who all is interviewing?  We would like to be involved.
We are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
I talked to Mary Sloan (SAP) and Keith Clark (Call Center) is working with 
her.  I think she really appreciates the help/input.  
Have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re:reorg?


Sorry for the long-winded  message....
Thanks!  Talk to you soon.

The Aquila issue has been largely addressed: the killed deals have been 
primarly due to one trader there-Par O'Kane, and I've spoken with him on 
this. I think this will resolve the problem. The Kock issue seems to be a 
hardware issue on their side, and I spoke with the head of IT/b to b there 
and she assured me they are trying to resolve this issue.  I offered one of 
our tech guys to visit their shop.  Jeff

Subject: Killed EOL Deals

Sally asked that I forward the detail of the "killed" EOL transactions to 
both of you.  We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers 
that a deal transacted via EnronOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we 
have continued to see a few of these deals occur.  In summary, we have had a 
total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have 
been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13).  Obviously, the 
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and 
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not 
appearing on the customer's summary report.  It is important to stress to the 
Commercial team that the way to "get out of a trade" is to do an offsetting 
trade or have our Legal Dept prepare a termination agreement.  Please feel 
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to 
work with Legal in the case of a terminated deal.  



Feel free to call me with any questions (x36557).

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

I have not received a call back from Jeff Bartlett, but based on the brochure 
I received from Louise, here is what I understand:

DealBench is a way to streamline processes to efficiently execute 
transactions and distribute deal-related information.  There are 5 platform 
tools - document sharing, multi-media, auctioning, secure communication, and 
deal management.   There are five primary products offered which utilize the 
tools provided...  Bank Products, Structured Products, Commercial Paper, 
Procurement, and Legal Space. 

1) Bank Products - deal management for issuance of debt offerings (credit 
revolvers/secured term-notes) 
2) Structured Products - deal management for initial issuance or re-sale of 
bonds, leveraged leases and other financial transactions
3)  Commercial Paper - deal mgmt for issuance of CP
4)  Procurement - management of wholesale purchasing and selling of various 
products
5)  Legal Space - designed to meet the needs of attorneys at law firms (doc 
sharing, aggregation and organization in a secure environment)

I have a lot of questions for Jeff, so I will send you a quick note when I 
speak to him.

This is the preliminary results of "round 2" of testing the management 
report.  I will give you the highlights tomorrow in our meeting.  (Stephen's 
comments pretty much cover it).

Louise,

I have attached a draft of the newly revised report on our test results of 
the EOL Management Report for your review.  Please keep in mind this is a 
tentative draft.  Mark and Andrew still want to perform some QA on the 
results and Torrey is still looking into some of the observations.  

To summarize, we observed a significant improvement from the last test we 
performed a few months ago.  The systemic problems that created a large 
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly 
reduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent 
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal 
booking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's 
knowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies 
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items.  

Andrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we 
return, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final 
results once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.



Steve

Hi Amita and Angela,

Today went very smoothly. We had one glitch in that UK Power jumped the gun 
and changed their columns in today's report.  We were able to spot it and fix 
it.  Getting the heads up from Lara was greatly appreciated!  Please continue 
to communicate changes you know about to us because it is a tremendous help!

Thank you for your help.  Hope you have a great afternoon!

fyi - we are finally getting to a point where we can spend some time looking 
at the numbers to determine what some of the trends are.  We will be sending 
this to Louise/Dave to highlight some of those that may require commercial 
intervention.

Subject: Trend Analysis for Select Commodity Groups

Attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have 
either been demonstrating, or have been thought to be demonsrating, a decline 
in EOL transactions as a percentage of total trading activity. The graphs for 
each group represent a line plot of EOL's weekly percentage of total trading 
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months. The attachment 
also contains source data on the second and third pages, which gives the 
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs. These 
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a 
decreasing or erratic EOL trend, but were not graphed because they averaged 
less than 10-15 total transactions (both EOL and non-EOL) per week. 

A few notes on the four graphed commodity groups:

AUSTRIAN POWER -  The overall EOL trend as a percentage of transactions in 
Austrian Power has been upward over the last three months, despite the sharp, 
temporary decrease which took place at the end of July as a result of the 
head Austrian Power Trader and Stack Manager going on holiday. Since his 
return, the percentage has picked back up and as of 8/22 about 30% of 
Austrian Power trades were once again being done through EOL. There is cause 
for concern here, however, in the fact that the absence of one trader 
effectively shut off EOL trading in this commodity group.


LPG - The LPG products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception, 
with EOL transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of 
total LPG trading activity. This overall trend remains intact and as of 8/22, 
EOL accounted for 26% of LPG trades.

Crude & Products - This commodity group has been demonstrating a steady 
decline in EOL trading activity over the last three months. While EOL trades 
accounted for approximately 20% of all crude and products activity in May, 
this percentage has dropped off to just over 10% as of August 22nd. This 
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy, as well as the 
relatively large data pool on which it is based.


UK Power - Although the absolute number of trades in UK Power dropped off 
significantly at the end of July, EOL's percentage of UK Power transactions 
has remained fairly stable. EOL's percentage of UK Power trades "spiked" 
briefly during the second week of June, but outside of this the percentage of 
UK Power trading represented by EOL transactions has fluctuated between 20 
and 40 percent. On trade date 8-22, EOL transactions accounted for just over 
50% of all transactions done in UK Power.

s=20
start to use it.

3. New Website Feature Details

Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that=20
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become=20
available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are=20
executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders wi=
ll=20
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.

Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20
screen in the website.

Product tabs: EnronOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to=
=20
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can=

screen.

Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and=
=20
industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be=

4. New Stack Manager Features

The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi=
ll=20

ll=20
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe=
rs=20
against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a=
=20
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed=
=20
against that product.

Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same=
=20
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you =
to=20
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t=
he=20
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price=
=20
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde=
rs=20
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.

It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P=
roduct=20
Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, mak=
e=20
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope=
rties=018=20
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers=
=20
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.

Just to give you all a heads up...

Jeff Skilling has asked for a revenue number for EOL that represents what 
Enron reports on our financial statements (including the Mark-to-Market value 
of all of our open positions resulting from EOL trading).   We are 
specifically looking for MTM value as of the close of trading on the 15th and 
would like to be able to review the results by mid-afternoon (Houston) on the 
16th.   We will need each desk to calculate their EOL-specific MTM value and 
consolidate this information at the Commodity Group level (ie. U.S. Power, 
Global Liquids, N. American Gas, etc.) and return it to the Product Control 
Group (Torrey Moorer/Carrie Southard) by mid-afternoon on the 16th (Houston) 
in order to combine the information into a report for delivery on the 17th.   
We are primarily interested in the total MTM value of our open EOL positions, 
but if it is possible to provide a breakout for the MTM value of EOL physical 
sales, this would help us break out the revenue numbers.   If you have 
questions, please contact Torrey Moorer at x36218. 

Thank you!
Sheri

Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal 
count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately 
2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from 
714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has 
decreased steadily in December.

*  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by 
about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the 
average daily EOL volume has decreased about 40% since November.  However, 
the average daily Non-EOL deal count has only decreased by about 10% since 
November, from 88 to 79 deals per day.

*  US West Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 71% 
since November, from 187 to 54 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has decreased by only about 21% since November, from 171 
to 136 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume has 
remained steady.

*  US East Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 24% 
since November, from 167 to 127 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has actually increased by about 3% since November, from 
230 to 237 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume 
has increased by about 20% total.  These recent trends in Power may indicate 
a shift in on-line power transactions from EOL to our competitors.

*  LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, to 444 in November.  In December,  LPG's appear to 
have levelled off with 449 deals completed in December.  The total monthly 
EOL volumes have increased similarly as well.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for December was only about 83% 
of the total in November.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 47% since 
November, from a daily average of 242 to a daily average of 357 for December.

Attached is a draft of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement which will 
be used to allow Brokers to transact on behalf of their customers.  Please 
review the document and give me any comments.  Please pay particuliar 
attention to Section 3 Transactions.  

Also please note that it will be imperative that broker confirmations are 
done each day on Broker Client Transactions to limit the exposure associated 
with online transaction broker breakage costs.  The confirmations group will 
be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of 
any discrepancies between Enron and the Broker.   Notification by the 
confirmations group will be the only means by which credit will be informed 
to shut down broker activity in the case of a transaction that has not been 
confirmed and/or verified by the broker.

Thank you

Just fyi - Andy Z. has asked that I be the administrator (i.e Master User) 
for IntercontinentalExchange for all of ENA, ECC, and EPMI trading.  The cost 
of this exchange is $500 per user so we are going to be closely monitoring 
who is getting access to the site.  We are working  to get something set up 
on eRequest to track and automate this process.  We have a meeting scheduled 
for Wed, so I will give you all the details then.

Thanks

It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  Attached is the ICE New User
Enrollment Form.  This is the means by which you can identify the
individuals that are to be set up as ICE users and the level of access (User

of the individuals who will be acting as the primary Administrative, Credit,
IT, and Invoicing contacts for IntercontinentalExchange.

You will need to complete a separate form for each Enron entity that
executed a Participant Agreement.

If you have any questions, please call me at 770.738.2129.  Thanks for your

Sally - just an fyi...  Jeff Hodge requested that we send him the information 
below.  Evidently, the FERC has requested that several US wholesale companies 
provide a great deal of information to them due to the volatility of natural 
gas prices the past few weeks (it is being driven by the California 
markets).  Legal got them agree to simply giving them a weighted average 
price of gas on the 11th for delivery on the 12th.  It worked out as $24.47 
for buys and $18.14 for sales.  This is US physical next day only.

Sally asked that I forward the detail of the "killed" EOL transactions to 
both of you.  We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers 
that a deal transacted via EnronOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we 
have continued to see a few of these deals occur.  In summary, we have had a 
total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have 
been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13).  Obviously, the 
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and 
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not 
appearing on the customer's summary report.  It is important to stress to the 
Commercial team that the way to "get out of a trade" is to do an offsetting 
trade or have our Legal Dept prepare a termination agreement.  Please feel 
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to 
work with Legal in the case of a terminated deal.  



Feel free to call me with any questions (x36557).
