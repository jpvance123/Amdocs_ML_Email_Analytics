hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner 
the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop 
you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same 
around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born 
-- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt 
sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or 
anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an 
experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a 
good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so 
"hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.

Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you 
haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been 
feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your 
life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out 
in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're 
expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see 
what's going on with you.  Write back if you can.

The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why 
we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso 
Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that 
El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, 
both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We 
feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing 
field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be 
directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, 
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and 
they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on 
eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help.

I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i 
received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and 
not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status 
of the printer?  Thanks.

Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco 
Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these 
changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new 
counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks!

Subject: Warning Mildly Offensive But Funny As Hell


Thirsty Cowboys:

Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from 
their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking 
quietly about cattle prices.

Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, 
begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real 
distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.

"Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.

No, the woman shakes her head.

"Kin ya breathe?" asks the other.

The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first 
cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her 
panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the 
small of her back.

This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her 
mouth, and she begins to breathe again.

The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His 
partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I 
never seen anybody do it."

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.

We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 
1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these 
RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, 
will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away.  
Please let me know what I need to do.

i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you 
really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than 
understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really 
hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than 
spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you 
about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once 
again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you 
wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love 
you!

every single day -- there may have been some days when we called them.  we 
can call you if you need further explanation.

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december 
purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 
12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a 
price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and 
they will be reinvoicing us.

We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I 
will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate 
from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get 
the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.

I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it 
looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got 
married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at 
UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll 
be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I 
spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am 
doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for 
Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm 
trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and 
challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has 
not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a 
house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved 
into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents 
and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live 
there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address 
is:
4419 Stackstone Ln.
Katy, TX 77450
I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever 
make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the 
next email!
Take Care and Happy Holidays!
 
 
Love, 
Tori

we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy 
hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not 
in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if 
you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked 
to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the 
whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just 
hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the 
way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect 
right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime 
in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my 
waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though 
they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the

these charges are not valid  - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a 
constrained point.  several people on the desk discussed this potential 
problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not 
intend on paying any penalty charges.  this deal was done on a gtc - spot 
contract, not on their firm agreement.

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

Have you ever asked your child a question too
many times? I hope you remember my story when they start getting
frustrated! My three year old son had a lot of problemswith
potty training; and I was on him constantly. One day we
stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch between errands. It was
very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco I
smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven month
old daughter. And she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked, and he said, "No." I kept
thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have any
clothes with me.
"Then I said, "Matt, are you sure you did not
have an accident?" "No," he replied. I just knew that he must have
had, because the smell was getting worse. So I asked one
more time, "Matt, did you have an accident?" This time he
jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread h! is
cheeks and yelled "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!" While
100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he
calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if
nothing had happened. I was mortified but some kind elderly
people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me
for the best laugh they had ever had

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.

hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am 
trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve 
been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to 
change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe 
$145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for 
making the semi-finals?

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I
cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."

Tory-

Sorry for being late.  I did call on Friday and left a message with Jaynie
(?) or Jamie (?).  As I told her, we would like nominate 7,000MMBtu per day
for the month of November 2000.  Losses on the PG & E line are unchanged
from October 2000 at  2.88%.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would 
be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but 
i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume 
though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can.

Subject: trader joke



A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather 
Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an 
email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori 
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping 
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me 
an email - let's catch up.

here are the two new index descriptions that we need:
 
For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr
For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top
 
 
Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special 
language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are 
subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all 
interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating 
conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and 
are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
  
We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can 
come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational 
constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it 
should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.

just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm 
sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great 
deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - 
my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby 
- due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a 
mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need 
to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit 
me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo 
stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was 
the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 
years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.  
anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing

thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me 
a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco 
restricted product.  i am still getting complaints from people who should 
have access, but they are telling me that they do not.  thank you.

Tori,

What we'll have to do is to move those products which are in the restricted 
product types to the regular product types.  Then I will set the restricted 
product types to archived. We will need to coordinate as to when you want to 
do this.

Thanks,

Melba

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."

I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the 
item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which 
should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still 
says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay?

Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
me an email - let's catch up.

Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas 
trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question 
for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I 
have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the

Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( 
One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as 
well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental 
Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made 
Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own 
travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  
This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a 
vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on 
December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from 
my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due 
to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not 
be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I 
spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he 
indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on 
September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I 
book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same 
policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel 
like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable 
policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my 
situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a 
vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month 
old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help 
me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your 
policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He 
was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for 
the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work 
about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping 
that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your 
competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a 
credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another 
person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as 
a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my 
personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has 
definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you 
can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.

Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
me an email - let's catch up.

Hey Sean!  I just thought about you yesterday because I remembered your 
birthday was coming up.  I have no idea if this is the correct email address 
for you, so I won't write too much.  Write back if you can - I have alot to 
tell you.

river trip sounded like a blast!  the pool is going well - next step is the 
deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 
weeks.  pat got a job  - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be 
working downtown at waste management.  it was a pretty good offer -- good 
benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he 
had at bank united.  we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for 
me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care 
center -- that was a big relief.  so -- things continue to fall into place -- 
we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues...

Hi.  I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the 
new day care center.  I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether 
or not we have been accepted.  I know the center doesn't open until 
September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line 
something up if I do not get in.  Also , do you know an exact date for the 
scheduled opening?  Thanks for your help.

Subject: April 2001 Nomination


All-

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the 
drinks.  i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we 
will need at least one extra person.  it looks like everyone that was there 
last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that 
still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too 
much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really 
hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can 
possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming.  
we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all 
the kids.

Subject: May nominations


All-

The total nomination for month of May 2001 is 10,526MMBtu per day.  This odd
number is made up of the sum of the following:

1. 4,026MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased again from April 2001 to 2.63%.  We
have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

We will still operate with only one steam unit (Broadway 3) on line for most
of the month.  Sometime about the fourth week of May, we will be bringing
one more steam unit on line.  At that time, I may need to increase our
nomination.  With the increasing temperatures and the possibility that the
ISO will begin paying generators, we expect our fuel usage to actually reach
and occasionally exceed our nomination in May.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

Subject: trader joke



A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

Looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the 
decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current 
product and create a new one also

Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product 
name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product 
type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the 
EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted 
every time the word "Topock" appears.
 
We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, 
but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index 
product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would 
also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
 
I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.








Tori,

Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.  Their
address is now correct.

As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades
detailed below.   Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra
and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.


Trades to Cancel:

To confirm that you agree to cancel, then please forward this to him at
gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree.   (You can also hit
"REPLY ALL" since I cc'd on this email).   I will call you and let you know
what the new downstream contract will be.

Subject: Admin Asst's Day

We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I 
will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate 
from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get 
the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.

I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this 
is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume.  
He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing 
for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off 
myself.  Thanks again.

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her 
at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever 
a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 
11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live 
close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it 
there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March.  
I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really 
well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and 
catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new 
email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun 
planning the wedding!

Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco 
Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these 
changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new 
counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks!

i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan 
before we actually lock this thing up.  we are still going to do it, but we 
both feel better about having both names on the documents.  can you tell me 
exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working?

I'm so glad you wrote back.  Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?  I have 
been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by 
the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I 
had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet?  
How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I 
can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years?  
That makes me feel old!  I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought!  
Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call 
first - my number is 281-578-9135.  
 
P.S. -- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest 
friends and she says "HI."

This is too funny:

A quote from "Centuries,"  a book
of prophesies written by Nostradamus.

"Come the millenium, month 12, in the home of greatest power, the Village
Idiot will come forth to be acclaimed the leader."

the trader over there is JB Smith.  if you would like - you can send me a 
copy of the invoice, and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached 
- and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the 
issure to be resolved.
